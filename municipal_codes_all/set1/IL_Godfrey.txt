PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Godfrey, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2001 Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances adopted by the president and board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John E. Dombroski, Vice President Supplements, and Anne Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the village employees for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 05-2018, §§ 1-27, adopted Feb. 2, 2018, amended div. 6 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 6, §§ 2-231-2-260, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 14-2012, 5-15-2012; Ord. No. 12-2013, 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 02-2015, 3-17-2015. 

Sec. 2-231. - Introduction. 
    This manual is a statement of policies and procedures to be followed by employees of the village. It is not intended to form a written or implied employment contract. 
    This manual applies to all full-time employees of the village. A full-time employee is defined as an employee working 35 or more hours per week on a regular basis with a term of employment of six consecutive months or longer and approved by the village authorities. It applies to employees who are elected officials to the extent that it is permitted by state and federal law. This manual applies to employees who are members of a collective bargaining unit, to the extent that their collective bargaining agreement is silent regarding any particular issue. If any section of this manual is in conflict with a section of a collective bargaining agreement, the terms of the employee's collective bargaining agreement shall prevail. 
    This manual applies to part-time employees of the village. A part-time employee is defined as an employee working at least 20 hours per week but less than 35 hours per week with a term of employment of six consecutive months or longer. This manual applies to temporary full-time and part-time employees of the village. A temporary full-time employee is defined as an employee working at least 35 hours per week with a term of employment of less than six consecutive months. A temporary part-time employee is defined as an employee working less than 35 hours per week with a term of employment of less than six consecutive months. This manual also applies to casual employees of the village. Casual employees work less than 20 hours per week regardless of the term of appointment. However, employee benefits apply only to full-time employees, unless otherwise provided by separate agreement. 
    This manual also applies to all elected officials and other appointed positions where applicable. The village reserves the right to interpret policies that apply to the manual. The village reserves its right to make unilateral changes or amendments to this manual. In the event that an oral statement is made, or an oral agreement is entered into that conflict with the terms of this manual, the terms of this manual shall prevail. In the event of a contradiction between the manual and any statement made to an employee by a supervisor or other village agent, the provisions of this manual shall govern. Any agreements or assurances governing the economic terms (e.g., salary and benefits) during an employee's tenure of employment must be in writing and signed and approved by the village. All employees are employees at will. An employment at will relationship is one which has no specific duration, and such relationship may be terminated at will by either the employer, or the employee for or without cause. It is each employee's responsibility to read and abide by all rules and regulations, policies and procedures in the manual. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-232. - Appointed positions. 
    Ordinance No. 19-98, an ordinance providing procedure for the appointment and removal of appointive positions for the Village of Godfrey, Madison County, Illinois, is repealed in its entirety. The following provisions shall hereafter apply to appointive positions within the village. 
A.  Appointments. All appointive positions of the village shall be filled by appointment by the mayor of the village, by and with the consent of the village board of trustees, which shall be obtained through a majority vote of approval of the board, for each such appointment, except where otherwise provided by law of ordinance. 
B.  Term. Except where provided by law, or ordinance, all appointive positions of the village shall be for a one year term or until a successor appointee is appointed, whichever shall last occur, unless specifically stated otherwise by the mayor when called for the appointment. 
C.  Removal of appointees. Except where otherwise provided by statute, the mayor may remove any appointee on any written charge, whenever the mayor is of the opinion that the interest of the municipality demand removal. The mayor shall report the reasons for the removal to the board of trustees at a meeting to be held not less than five nor more than ten days after the removal. If the mayor fails or refuses to report to the board of trustees the reasons for the removal, or if the board of trustees by a two-thirds vote of all members authorized disapprove of the removal, the appointee thereupon shall be restored to the office from which the appointee was removed. Upon restoration, the appointee shall give a new bond and take a new oath of office if applicable. No appointee shall be removed a second time for the same offense. 
D.  Due process. Any person who is removed pursuant to this division shall have the right to request in writing an opportunity to be heard at the meeting of the board of trustees which may consider the removal of the person removed by the mayor, and if such an opportunity is requested in a timely manner, the board of trustees shall grant the request to be heard prior to any vote by the board of trustees on the action taken by the mayor.

Sec. 2-234. - Fair Labor Standard Act. 
    The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime compensation, recordkeeping, and child labor standards affecting certain full-time and part-time workers in the private sector, as well as in federal, state, and local governments.

    2.2 Overtime and Compensatory Compensation 
    Overtime will be paid at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for each hour worked in a work week in excess of the maximum allowable for a given position. 
    Employees who are required to work overtime or on a legal holiday or on other regularly scheduled days off, for which they are not compensated by additional pay, shall be allowed compensatory time (for overtime worked the rate shall be at one and one-half times the normal compensatory time, and at the normal rate for holiday or regularly scheduled days off) within three months following the month in which the overtime or holiday was worked.

Any employee believing he or she was not reviewed fairly or any employee who, as a result of his or her evaluation does not receive the additional benefits other similar classifications receive (such as a raise in salary), or who has been notified of possible termination, may appeal pursuant to the grievance procedure under section 12.3. Introductory new hires will accrue vacation and sick leave in the same manner as regular employees, but paid vacations shall not be authorized during the first year of employment.

If any employee does accept a gift from a prohibited source pursuant to one of the exceptions listed in the Act, the employee must disclose said gift on the village's "Inventory" form, a copy of which can be obtained from the employee's department head. 
    In addition to the penalties provided by state law, a violation of this section will result in disciplinary action, including the possibility of dismissal. 
    6.16 Electioneering 
    Employees will not be allowed to circulate political petitions or engage in electioneering in any manner during regular working hours. Employees are subject to certain criminal constraints of the Act prohibiting: 
a.  Intimidation of voters; 
b.  Interference with nominations for elections; 
c.  Promise of employment or other benefits for political activity; 
d.  Deprivation of employment or other benefits for political activity; 
e.  Solicitation from persons on relief; 
f.  Coercion by means of relief appropriations; 
g.  Disclosure of names and persons on relief. 
    6.17 Harassment Policy 
    The village reaffirms the principle that its employees have a right to be free from discrimination in any form by any other employee; and the village recognizes that harassment, whether overt, implicit, or through misinterpretation, creates potential harm to individual employees, to the person complained of, and to the overall employment climate of the village; and it is the responsibility of each individual employee to refrain from harassment, and it is the right of each individual employee to work in an environment free from harassment. 
    6.17.1 Sexual Harassment Policy 
    It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the village to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. 
    6.17.2 Definition of Sexual Harassment 
    This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as: 
    Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when: 
(1)  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; 
(2)  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
(3)  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
    Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes: 
(1)  Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. 
(2)  Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises. 
(3)  Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites. 
(4)  Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault. 
(5)  Textual/electronic. "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter). 
    The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a "reasonable person." 
    6.17.3 Procedure for Reporting an Allegation of Sexual Harassment 
    An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report. 
    Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment, including the following: 
(1)  Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo. 
(2)  Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality. 
    The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment. 
    6.17.4 Resolution Outside Municipality 
    The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days. 
    Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages. 
    All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. 
    6.17.5 Prohibition on Retaliation for Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations 
    No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's: 
1.  Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy; 
2.  The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy; or 
3.  Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy. 
    For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy. 
    No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation. 
    Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following: 
1.  Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation; 
2.  Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state employee; or 
3.  Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act. 
    Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)). 
    According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act. 
    An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge-due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. 
    6.17.6 Consequences of a Violation of the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment 
    In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency. 
    6.17.7 Consequences for Knowingly Making a False Report 
    A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements. 
    In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a state's attorney, the attorney general, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. 
    6.17.7 Whistleblower Protection 
    The village will fully support and comply with the State of Illinois Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/1 et seq.). A whistleblower is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within the village. The reporting person can be an employee, past employee or contract worker. The noted wrongdoing can be a past act or an ongoing act, or in the planning stages. 
    There are two types of whistleblowing reporting and disclosure. The first is internal. This means the reported activity is made to someone within the village who has the duty to investigate the disclosed act. The second type is an external disclosure. This means a disclosure is made to a third party outside of the village such as a law enforcement organization, the media or another governmental agency. Whistleblowers will be protected under the Illinois Whistleblower Act. 
    6.17.8 Anti-bullying 
    The village considers workplace bullying unacceptable and will not tolerate it under any circumstances. This policy shall apply to all employees, regardless of his or her employee status (i.e., managerial versus hourly, full-time versus part-time, employee versus independent contractor and elected officials). Any employee found in violation of this policy will be disciplined, up to and including immediate termination. Independent contractors found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to contact cancellation. 
    The village defines bullying as persistent, malicious, unwelcome, severe and pervasive mistreatment that harms, intimidates, offends, degrades or humiliates an employee, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment. 
    The village promotes a healthy workplace culture where all employees are able to work in an environment free of bullying behavior. 
    The village encourages all employees to report any instance of bullying behavior. Any reports of this type will be treated seriously, investigated promptly and impartially. 
    The village further encourages all employees to formally report any concerns of assault, battery, or other bullying behavior of criminal nature to the sheriff's department. The village requires any supervisor who witnesses any bullying, irrespective of reporting relationship, to immediately report this conduct to the [sheriff's department]. 
    The village will protect an employee who reports bullying conduct from retaliation or reprisal. 
    The village considers the following types of behavior to constitute workplace bullying. Please note, this list is not meant to be exhaustive and is only offered by way of example: 
(1)  Staring, glaring or other non-verbal demonstrations of hostility; 
(2)  Exclusion or social isolation; 
(3)  Excessive monitoring or micro-managing; 
(4)  Work-related harassment (work-overload, unrealistic deadlines, meaningless tasks); 
(5)  Being held to a different standard than the rest of an employee's work group; 
(6)  Consistent ignoring or interrupting of an employee in front of co-workers; 
(7)  Personal attacks (angry outburst, excessive profanity, or name-calling); 
(8)  Encouragement of others to turn against the targeted employee; 
(9)  Sabotage of a co-worker's work product or undermining of an employee's work performance; 
(10)  Stalking; 
(11)  Unwelcome touching or unconsented-to touching; 
(12)  Invasion of another person's personal space; 
(13)  Unreasonable interference with an employee's ability to do his or her work (i.e., overloading of emails); 
(14)  Repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the use of derogatory remarks, insults, and epithets; 
(15)  Conduct that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to the employer's legitimate business interest. 
    Early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of bullying. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period has been established, the village strongly urges the prompt reporting of complaints or concerns so that rapid and constructive action can be taken. The village will make every effort to stop alleged workplace bullying before it becomes severe or pervasive, but can only do so with the cooperation of its employees. Individuals who believe they have experience conduct that they believe violates this policy, or who have concerns about such matters, should report their complaints verbally or in writing to his or her supervisor, the village attorney, or the mayor before the conduct becomes severe or pervasive. 
    Individuals should not feel obligated to report their complaints to their immediate supervisor first before bringing the matter to the attention of one of the other designated representatives identified above. The availability of this complaint procedure does not preclude individuals who believe they are being subjected to bullying conduct from promptly advising the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and requesting that such behavior immediately stop. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-239. - Communications. 
    It is essential that all village employees communicate and cooperate with one another to maintain efficiency both within and outside of their respective departments, so that the intent and goals of the village remain clear. 
    For example, department heads shall keep the mayor and appropriate committee chairpersons apprised of departmental functions and activities. Notice of any functions or activities that impact the financial position of the village shall be given to the mayor. Department heads and departmental employees must share information with one another, such that the department heads will know about all major activities proceeding within his or her department. 
    Likewise, department heads must keep employees within their respective departments aware of departmental policies, ordinances, village policies and state and federal laws. Department heads are encouraged to meet with employees periodically to ensure that their departments are adhering to such regulations. 
    Department heads shall also encourage employees to cooperate and interact with other departments.

    7.3 Forms, Letterhead, Equipment 
    Use of village departmental forms, letterhead, or telecommunications equipment shall be reserved for official business.

Village employees shall testify, respond to inquiries, and conduct village business in a credible and cooperative manner. Any subpoena fee received by the employee must be signed over to the village. 
    7.6 Complaints Against Fellow Employees 
    Any complaints regarding a fellow employee shall be handled by the department head immediately. Employees shall be made aware of complaints against them immediately, unless it will compromise an investigation. Making a false, malicious or harassing complaint against another employee shall be grounds for discipline. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to inhibit any individual's First Amendment Rights. 
    7.7 Confidentiality 
    Employees shall refrain from discussing or disclosing confidential operations, business or records of the village without first obtaining the necessary authorization or permission of their department head. There should not be any conversation in public by employees regarding confidential village business. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-240. - Honesty in the workplace. 
    It is the intent of the village to adhere to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including business ethics policies. As such, the village has decided to adopt the honesty in the workplace policy, which: 
(1)  Encourages staff and volunteers to come forward with credible information on illegal practices or serious violations of adopted policies of the village; 
(2)  Specifies that the village will protect the person from retaliation; and 
(3)  Identifies where such information can be reported. 
A.  Encouragement of reporting. The village has an open door policy and suggests that employees share their questions, concerns, inquiries or complaints about illegal practices or serious violations of the village's policies, including illegal or improper conduct by the village itself, by its leadership, or by others on its behalf. Appropriate subjects to raise under this policy would include financial improprieties, accounting or audit matters, ethical violations, or other similar illegal or improper practices or policies. 
B.  Protection from retaliation. The village prohibits retaliation by or on behalf of the village staff or volunteers for making good faith complaints, reports or inquiries under this policy or for participating in a review or investigation under this policy. This protection extends to those whose allegations are made in good faith but prove to be mistaken. The village reserves the right to discipline persons who make bad faith, knowingly false, or vexatious complaints, reports or inquiries or who otherwise abuse this policy. 
C.  Where to report. Complaints, reports and inquiries may be made under this policy on a confidential or anonymous basis. They should describe in detail the specific facts demonstrating the basis for the complaints, reports or inquiries. They should be directed to the mayor and at least two trustees. The village will conduct a prompt, discreet, and objective review or investigation. Staff or volunteers must recognize that the village may be unable to fully evaluate a vague or general complaint, report or inquiry that is made anonymously. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-241. - Promotions, transfers and demotions. 
    The village may reclassify employees, abolish positions and lay off workers, if such steps are taken in good faith to promote greater economy and efficiency, in accordance with local, state and federal law, and any applicable agreements. 
    9.1 Promotions 
    Positions within the service of the village shall be filled by promotion whenever practical, and in the best interest of the village. All such promotions shall be in accordance with departmental procedures, labor agreements, and/or boards or commissions governing the same. 
    9.2 Transfers 
    9.2.1 Transfers may be allowed when management deems it to be in the best interest of the village. A voluntary transfer may be approved if the employee is qualified for the position, and the transfer will not negatively affect the operations of the employee's current department. 
    An involuntary transfer may be ordered by management when necessary to afford greater efficiency to a department, including, but not limited to, a determination that an employee may be more effective in another position. Management may also transfer an employee rather than enforce a lay-off if the employee is qualified for another position for which there is a vacancy. 
    The village will not create a new position for a disabled employee. However, a disabled employee may transfer into an existing position if there is a vacancy, if he or she is able to perform the essential functions of the position and if he or she is the most qualified person for the position. 
    9.2.2 Seniority 
    The employee will maintain seniority based on length of consecutive service time with the village. 
    9.2.3 Demotions 
    Demotion is the assignment of an employee to a position of less responsibility and/or less compensation than the position from which the demotion was made. The village's authority to implement demotions shall include, but not be limited to, the inability of an employee to perform the work efficiently, a reduction in work force, or a restructure of the village's organization. Any such demotions shall be in accordance with the departmental procedures, labor agreements, and/or boards or commissions governing same. 
    An employee's seniority with the village will not be affected by a demotion. If an employee is transferred through a demotion, departmental seniority is to be determined by the date on which the employee is transferred to the new department. 
    A demoted employee will retain all accrued vacation and sick leave earned in his or her former position. However, scheduling advantages and compensation associated with the former position may or may not be retained. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-242. - Separation. 
    10.1 General Provision

    10.2 Separation During Introductory Period 
    An individual's employment may be summarily terminated (i.e., without a hearing) during the introductory period if: 
A.  The department head recommends termination and the village board approves it and, 
B.  Notice of such termination is issued in written form by the supervisor or department head, subsequent to any necessary approval of the village board or commission having jurisdiction of the department, if applicable. 
    10.3 Separation 
    Employees who leave the services of the village for any reason shall receive all pay outlined in this section which may be due them with the following qualifications: 
1.  Notwithstanding the language contained in section 14.3 herein, employees shall be paid for all unused vacation time provided that the department head is notified by the employee of his/her leaving two weeks in advance or sufficient reason is given in the absence of such notice. An employee's unused sick leave will not be paid to the employee at time of separation. 
2.  An employee who owes any money to the village at the time of the employee's separation shall have his/her final pay applied against the account of whatever the amount may be needed to satisfy it and shall be given a receipt for the money credited.

4.  Employees who are in the introductory period, who voluntarily separate from the village, or fail the necessary schooling required during the introductory period, shall return to the village all equipment, uniforms, books, and accessories in their possession or make satisfactory payment thereof. The value of the materials shall be deducted from the final check until all materials have been returned. 
    10.3.1 Severance pay is not a policy of the village. 
    10.4 Resignations 
    Employees who wish to voluntarily terminate employment with the village shall submit a written resignation to their supervisor or department head at least two weeks prior to the intended date of departure. Failure to do so, will result in the employee being separated "not in good standing" and thereby ineligible for future reemployment.

    10.5 Layoffs 
    The village has the right to determine the size of the work force and to lay-off employees whenever it is deemed necessary, by reason of shortage of funds, lack of work, abolishment of a position, material changes in duties of organization, or other valid reasons. Any layoffs will be handled in accordance with this manual, departmental procedures, labor agreements, state and federal law, and boards or commissions governing the same. 
    10.6 Dismissals 
    In the best interest of all employees, as well as the village, it is necessary to maintain high standards of conduct and job performance. Unless otherwise expressly provided by a written agreement, the village may terminate employment at any time, for any reason, with or without advance notice or cause. Dismissals will be handled in accordance with this manual, labor agreements, and procedures, policies and regulations of the board of trustees. 
    10.7 Death of an Employee 
    Upon the death of an employee, the village will pay to the employee's legal heirs the accrued salary due, compensation for unused accrued vacation time, and any other pay due the employee at the time of the death.

Such examinations shall take place during normal working hours, and shall be provided at the expense of the village. 
    10.8.1 Compensation 
a.  For retirees subject to separate contract provisions and this manual, certain benefits shall be converted to monetary compensation upon retirement from the village. A retiree shall be entitled to compensation for the following unless otherwise provided by separate writing, or the limitations of section 10.3: 
1.  100 percent of accrued, unused vacation leave; 
2.  100 percent of accrued, unused compensatory time; and 
b.  Because an employee is not deemed to be a disability retiree until all accrued benefits for that person have been exhausted, a disability retiree will not have accrued any unused vacation leave, compensatory time, or sick leave. 
    10.9 Disability Under the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund 
    If an employee becomes sick or injured and is disabled for more than 30 days, employee can file an application for disability benefits with IMRF through the village clerk's office.

    10.10 Rights and Duties Upon Separation 
    Employees who separate from the service of the village shall receive payment of all salary earned up to the effective date of their termination, less all authorized deductions. Employees shall receive payment for accrued vacation. 
    10.11 Retirement 
    10.11.1 Definitions

b.  Village retiree. An employee who, by age and virtue of his or her service years with the village and at the time he or she left employment of the village, is receiving income from or is eligible to receive income from, a pension program with which the village is affiliated by Illinois law. 
c.  Disability retiree. A person, separated from service to the village because of illness or injury, who is eligible due to vesting or other legally established criteria to receive income or other benefits from a pension program with which the village is affiliated by Illinois law. No person shall be so classified a "disability retiree" until all accrued leave benefits for that person have been exhausted and the condition of their health is such that no work is reasonably available for them within the general category of their usual assignment. 
(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-243. - Disciplinary actions. 
    11.1 Working Relationships 
    It is the responsibility of each department head to organize his or her department. Supervisors are responsible for fostering positive work habits, productivity, and conduct which will help the department to operate efficiently. 
    Supervisors are expected to encourage cooperation and efficiency, including discipline of any employee whose conduct is not in the best interest of the village. This may include oral or written notice to the employee regarding behaviors that may negatively affect the department. Oral and written warnings should be reported to the department head. A supervisor should consult his or her department head prior to taking formal disciplinary action other than oral or written warnings. Written warnings shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file. 
    11.2 Forms of Disciplinary Action 
    Any employee who engages in improper conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, based on the circumstances of the individual case, up to and including discharge. The following guidelines are used by the village to determine the extent to which discipline may be appropriate. The village reserves the right to discipline an employee for engaging in other misconduct not specifically addressed in this manual. The village reserves the right to bypass the progressive disciplinary procedure and to discharge an employee for misconduct, when it is determined that the circumstances are serious enough to warrant not adhering to progressive disciplinary procedures. 
    Disciplinary action may be in the form of oral warning, written warning, suspension, demotion, reduction in pay, cancellation of accrued compensatory or personal leave, or discharge. In determining the appropriate level of discipline, offenses are to be considered cumulative. If the disciplinary action recommended is suspension without pay, the employee may choose to count the days against accrued compensatory or personal leave. Other than oral or written warnings, an employee shall be notified in writing prior to the effective date of the disciplinary action. 
    An employee who has been given notice of discharge may be retained on "duty" status, placed on leave with pay, or suspended without pay prior to the effective date of discharge. Unless expressly provided by a separate writing, the mayor or his designated representative shall make a final determination regarding dismissal for all positions other than those covered by the board of trustees. 
    Although the village has determined that the use of a progressive disciplinary procedure is the most effective method for achieving corrective action, the village retains the ultimate discretion to impose discipline on a case-by-case basis. The village reserves the right to forego a progressive disciplinary procedure if it deems that circumstances warrant a procedure or discipline other than the progressive disciplinary policy. 
    All disciplinary actions whether verbal or otherwise, shall be put in writing and a copy placed in the employee's personnel file and a copy given to the employee.

    A single offense depending on the severity of the action may be grounds for suspension. A pattern or accumulation of minor offenses may be grounds for suspension. An employee need not receive an oral or written warning for each act of misconduct prior to receiving notice of suspension. A second suspension within any 12 month period may be indicative of a pattern of behavior warranting discharge. 
    11.5 Discharge 
    Any single offense, depending on the severity of the action, may be grounds for discharge. Unless expressly provided in separate writing, an employee need not receive oral and written warnings prior to receiving notice of discharge.

    14.2 Authorization for Leave

    Vacation schedules shall be approved by each department head and mayor and subject to the needs of the village.

    15.1 General Provisions 
    Sick leave benefits are provided for the employee's illness or temporary disability only. Sick leave should not be used for vacation or personal days. Excessive sick leave may be grounds for discipline, including dismissal.

The certificate shall describe the nature of the illness and the number of days the employee will be absent from work.

P.  Documentation of the use of sick leave must be submitted to the administration department within one day of the event, i.e., doctor's visit, illness etc. The department head is responsible for the submission of the information to the administration department.

Sec. 2-248. - Other types of leave. 
    16.1 Jury Duty 
    The village will pay an employee's regular wages while he or she is assigned to jury duty. The employee shall assign or endorse compensation received for serving on jury duty to the village. The employee shall give his or her supervisor notice of at least one week prior to duty. The employee shall return to work at the village when excused from jury duty, even if only to work a portion of the day. 
    16.2 Military Leave 
    16.2.1 Long Term Military Leave 
    An employee called upon to serve in the United States military shall be granted leave to do so. Any such employee shall be entitled to all protections afforded by state and federal law. 
    16.2.2 Short Term Military Leave 
    An employee called for short term military leave (fewer than 31 days) shall be entitled to all protections afforded by state and federal law. An employee who is a member of a reserve component of the United States military is entitled to fulfill his or her annual commitment with the military unit. 
A.  An employee called to active duty as the result of an order of the President. If an employee is called to active duty as the result of the President, the village will continue to pay his or her salary. The village will continue to compensate the employee at his or her regular rate of pay. Upon return from the military leave, the employee shall remit his or her military pay to the village. The employee shall also remit to the village a written statement from his or her commanding officer, providing an accurate accounting of military pay, including all allowances received during the term of military leave. Prior to leaving, the employee may make arrangements with his or her department head to suspend payment of the regular salary, and to receive only military pay, rather than having to remit the military pay to the village. The employee's benefits will be unaffected by any short term military leave. 
B.  An employee called to active duty as the result of an order of the Governor, or as part of monthly and annual service requirements. Under state law, the village is not required to pay an employee's regular salary, which would mean that the employee would stop earning IMRF service credit and IMRF disability and death benefit coverage would stop. However, the village recognizes the importance of its community supporting employees who serve in the armed services. When called to active duty as the result of an order of the Governor, or as part of monthly and annual service requirements, the village will continue to compensate the employee at his or her regular rate of pay. This will allow the employee to accrue IMRF service credit, and continue coverage of IMRF disability and death benefits. Upon return from the military leave, the employee shall remit his or her military pay to the village. 
Prior to leaving, the employee may make arrangements with his or her department head to suspend payment of the regular salary, and to receive only military pay, rather than having to later remit the military pay to the village. 
    The foregoing sections are governed by the Illinois Government Employees Benefits Continuation Act (50 ILCS 140/2) and the Illinois Public Employee Armed Services Right Act (5 ILCS 330). Those statutes and amendments thereto are incorporated herein by reference. 
    16.3 Leave of Absence Without Pay 
    Unless otherwise expressly provided by separate writing, an employee may be granted a general leave of absence without pay, based on the following conditions: 
A.  The mayor may grant a full-time employee leave without pay, for up to a 30 day period when it is in the best interest of the village to do so. Any leave without pay exceeding 30 days may be granted only by the board of trustees. Leave without pay shall not constitute a break in employment status. An employee on unpaid leave of absence must pay all costs of benefits himself, including life insurance, medical insurance, pension contributions, etc. 
B.  Benefits, such as vacation leave and sick leave will not accrue during leave. 
C.  All requests for leave of absence shall be submitted in writing by the employee to his supervisor. The request shall state the reason the leave of absence is being requested and the length of time off requested by the employee. If the employee has not returned to work on the date specified and does not request an extension of the leave of absence, the village may consider termination of employment. When an employee returns from the unpaid leave of absence, the village resumes its contribution for benefits on the first of the month following his or her return. Employees shall normally be returned to the position they held at the time the leave of absence was granted. However, when a leave of absence is granted for an extended period of time, in excess of 60 days, the village cannot guarantee the availability of the position. In such cases, the village will make every effort to provide a comparable position. 
D.  If it is determined that false information was submitted in requesting leave, the employee will be immediately discharged from employment with the village. 
    16.3.1 Emergency Leave 
    The mayor or an employee's supervisor may authorize one emergency leave day, to be deducted from sick leave, to those employees who request it. If notice is not possible, then the request shall be submitted as when a sick leave day is requested. Emergency leave shall not be granted on the day before or the day after a village holiday or weekend unless the department head or the mayor deems the need for the leave to be of such severity as to warrant waiving this provision. Emergency leave shall not be given to more than one of the village's employees on any work day. No emergency leave days may be used during a work slowdown, work stoppage or strike. 
    16.4 Bereavement 
    Unless otherwise provided by separate writing, a leave of absence with pay will be allowed in the event of a death in the immediate family. Paid leave for bereavement is not to exceed three consecutive working days. An employee will not receive bereavement pay for any day that would have been a non-working day, including weekends, vacations, and normal off-duty days. 
    Immediate family includes: spouse or significant other, child, grandchild, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt, spouse's grandfather, spouse's grandmother, grandchildren, half-brother, half-sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, and son-in-law. Step family shall also be considered immediate family for purposes of bereavement leave. 
    In the event of a death of a relative or close friend not in the above category, one day of leave without pay may be granted at the sole discretion of the mayor, or the individual supervisor when applicable. An employee will be paid only for regularly scheduled workdays. 
    Nothing herein shall be interpreted as prohibiting a department head from allowing use of vacation or other accrued leave to be used for bereavement. 
    16.5 Professional Conference or Training 
    Employees who desire to attend professional conferences or professional training workshops as paid leave time must make a written application to the mayor. 
    16.6 Family Medical Leave Act Policy 
    The village recognizes that a leave of absence from employment may be necessary for family and medical reasons. Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an eligible employee may take 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. The employee will be required to use accrued, paid leave to cover some or all of the FMLA leave taken. Leave will only be unpaid if all accrued, paid leave is exhausted. 
A.  Eligibility. To be eligible for FMLA, the employee: 
a.  Must have worked for the village for at least 12 months, and 
b.  Must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to beginning the FMLA leave. 
B.  Reasons for taking leave. 
a.  The village will grant an eligible employee up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave, in a 12 month period for one or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  The birth of a child, and to care for the newborn child; 
(2)  The placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for the child; 
(3)  To care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition (includes spouse, child, or parent but not parent-in-law); or 
(4)  When the employee has a serious health condition. 
b.  If both spouses are employed by the village, the spouses may take a combined total of 12 workweeks leave for the birth or adoption and care of a child, or to care for an employee's parent who has a serious health condition. 
C.  Length of leave. The 12 weeks period is measured from the date the employee's first FMLA leave begins. Under the FMLA, an employee may take leave on an intermittent basis, or work a reduced schedule. Only the amount of leave actually taken will be charged as FMLA leave. 
An employee needing an intermittent or reduced schedule leave for foreseeable medical treatment must notify his or her department head and work with the village so that the departmental operations are not unduly disrupted. If deemed in the best interest of the village, the department head may transfer the employee to an alternative job, temporarily, with equivalent pay and benefits. 
An employee who fails to return to work immediately following expiration of an authorized leave period is subject to discharge. 
D.  Employee notification. An employee shall provide his or her department head with 30 days written notice when FMLA leave is foreseeable. When 30 days' notice cannot be given, the employee is to provide his or her department head with notice as soon as practicable which will immediately be forwarded to the administration department. The employee shall provide his or her department head with sufficient information, so the village can understand that the employee needs leave for a qualifying reason. 
E.  Notice to employee. The department of administration will respond to an employee's request for FMLA leave by giving the employee an "Employer Response to Employee Request for Family or Medical Leave." This form will provide the employee with notice, designating the leave as FMLA leave, and detailing specific expectations and obligations of the employee. 
A "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves one of the following: 
(1)  Hospital care. In-patient care (an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical facility, including any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with or consequent to such inpatient care. 
(2)  Absence plus treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition) that also involves: 
a.  Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or 
b.  Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. 
(3)  Pregnancy. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. 
(4)  Chronic conditions requiring treatments. A chronic condition which: 
a.  Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider; 
b.  Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); or 
c.  May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of capacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy). 
(5)  Permanent/long-term conditions requiring supervision. A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but not need to be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider. 
(6)  Multiple treatments (non-chronic conditions). Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments including any period of recovery therefrom by a health care provider or by a provider of a health care service under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, severe arthritis, and kidney disease. 
F.  Certification. If the employee is taking FMLA leave for a serious health condition, the need for leave must be supported by a certification issued by a physician. The village may, at its expense, require the employee to obtain a second medical certification from a physician. If the employee's physician, and a village designated physician differ, the village may require the employee to obtain certification from a third physician, at the village's expense. 
Before returning to work, an employee on FMLA leave due to his or her own serious health condition must submit a physician's written certification that the employee is able to return to work. While the employee is on leave, the village may periodically inquire as to the employee's intent to return to work. 
A certification form created by the department of labor shall be provided by the village. This form may be amended by the department of labor, and subsequent amended forms will be used by the village. 
G.  Health benefits. The village will maintain the employee's health benefits on the same terms as if the employee was still actively working for the village. The employee will be responsible for the entire contribution. 
The employee shall make premium contributions directly to the village clerk's office. Failure to pay contributions in a timely manner may result in a lapse of coverage. If the employee does not return to work, the village may recover from the employee premiums it has paid to maintain coverage on the employee's behalf. 
H.  Job restoration. An employee will be restored to his or her job, or an equivalent job, including the same terms of pay, benefits, and other employment conditions. 
I.  Outside employment. An employee shall not perform outside work while on FMLA leave.

Department heads shall use their best efforts to investigate any injury or illness leading to a worker's compensation claim.

Separate agreements may provide for alternate drug testing policies. 
    21.6.1 Reasonable Suspicion 
    Where there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is impaired due to the influence of a drug or alcohol while on duty, the employee may be required to report for drug and/or alcohol testing by the department head, the mayor or his designate. Refusal of an employee to comply with the order for drug and/or alcohol screening will be considered a refusal of a direct order, and will be cause for disciplinary action, including the possibility of discharge. Reasons for which an employee will be required to submit to testing include, but are not limited to: 
a.  An employee has been arrested or indicted for conduct involving illegal drug related activity; 
b.  An employee is injured while performing village business, causing reasonable suspicion of drug and/or alcohol use; 
c.  An employee is involved in an accident while performing village business, causing reasonable suspicion of drug and/or alcohol use; 
d.  An employee has absences or tardiness under circumstances giving rise to the reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use. 
    21.6.2 Written Notice 
    When an employee is ordered to submit to testing, the village will provide the employee with the reason for the order. A written notice setting forth the objective facts and reasonable inferences leading to the order will be provided in a reasonable time following the order. 
    21.6.3 Voluntary Request for Assistance 
    The village will not take adverse employment action against any employee because he or she voluntarily seeks treatment, counseling, or other support for an alcohol or drug related problem, unless the request follows the order to submit to testing, or the employee is found to be using illegal drugs or under the influence of drugs or alcohol while doing village business. 
    21.6.4 Discipline 
A.  First positive. The first confirmed positive test result will be cause for disciplinary action. To avoid discharge, an employee must agree to the following: 
(1)  The employee must attend the employee assistance program for evaluation, diagnosis and development of a rehabilitation treatment plan, consistent with generally accepted standards; 
(2)  The employee must cooperate in the rehabilitation plan, undergo unannounced periodic drug and alcohol screening for a period of up to 12 months, complete the rehabilitation, remain free of drug and alcohol use, and sign an agreement consenting to said conditions. 
B.  Second positive. 
(1)  If an employee enters a rehabilitation program, pursuant to "A" above, and has a second confirmed positive test while in the program, the employee will be suspended for 30 calendar days. To maintain employment, the employee will be required to continue the rehabilitation program, and comply with all other conditions of rehabilitation. Any further confirmed positive test will result in the employee's immediate discharge. 
(2)  If an employee is required to take a test based on a reasonable suspicion of use, and tests positive a second time, the employee will be discharged immediately. 
    This section shall in no way limit discipline for other offenses arising out of, related to, or aggravated by drug use or alcohol abuse, including but not limited to the possibility of discharge because the employee's condition is such that he or she is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position, or that he or she poses a direct threat to the health and safety of himself, herself or others. 
    21.6.5 Employment Status 
    The village will not be required to maintain an employee on active employment status if: 
(1)  It is determined by a physician that the employee's current use of drugs or alcohol will prevent him or her from performing the essential function of the employee's position, or 
(2)  The employee's current use will constitute a direct threat to the property and safety of himself or others. 
    An employee may use accrued and unused leave, or request an unpaid leave of absence pending treatment. 
    The village will make a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug free workplace through implementation of this drug free workplace policy. Department heads shall maintain more detailed regulations to further implement this policy, as they are in a position to deal more directly with individual employees. Such regulations shall be effective upon approval of the mayor. 
    21.6.6 Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 
    The village maintains access to an EAP which provides confidential assistance to employees who suffer from personal, emotional, drug or alcohol problems. Requests for assistance should be directed to the mayor. It is the responsibility of the employee to seek assistance for personal, emotional, drug or alcohol issues before those particular issues impair employment effectiveness. Once the village policy regarding a drug free/alcohol free workplace has been violated, seeking the assistance of the EAP will not necessarily be a mitigating factor in any disciplinary action.

    The employee should also recognize that e-mail messages deleted from the system might still be retrieved from the computer's back-up system when requested by authorized personnel. Consequently, messages that were previously deleted may be recreated, printed out, or forwarded to authorized personnel without the employee's knowledge. 
    22.1.4 The Village's Right to Monitor Use 
    The village reserves the right to monitor, intercept, access, disclose, retain, print, and delete all information created, sent, received, or stored in its electronic communications systems at any time, with or without employee notice. 
    The mayor or the mayor's designee may provide written authorization to those they deem necessary to provide access to stored electronic communications. 
    Internet usage will be monitored in the same manner as other electronic communications. However, in addition, the village will regularly monitor and maintain a log of employee's Internet access including the type of sites accessed and the name of the server and the time of day that access occurs. The mayor and department heads will have access to this log upon request. 
    Information obtained through monitoring may be used as a basis for employee discipline, termination, and evaluating employee performance. 
    22.1.5 Prohibited Activities 
A.  In addition to section 22.1.2, employees may not, without a department head's authorization, upload, download, or otherwise transmit copyrighted, trademarked, or patented material, trade secrets, or confidential, private or proprietary information or materials. 
B.  Employees may not upload, download or otherwise transmit illegal information or materials. 
C.  Employees may not use the village's electronic communication system to gain unauthorized access to remote computers or other systems to intrude, damage, alter, or disrupt such computers or systems in any way, nor may employees, without authorization from their department head, use someone else's code or password or disclose anyone's code or password including their own. It is a violation of this policy for employees to intentionally intercept, eavesdrop, record, or alter another person's Internet and e-mail messages. 
D.  Employees may not enable unauthorized individuals to have access to use or use the village's electronic communication system, or otherwise permit any use, which would jeopardize the security of the village's electronic communication systems. 
E.  Employees must use their real names when sending e-mail messages or other electronic communications and may not misrepresent, obscure or in any way attempt to subvert the information necessary to identify the real person responsible for the electronic communication. Sending e-mail messages under a fictitious name or false name is a violation of this policy. Likewise, using another employee's account or login ID constitutes a violation of this policy. See also section 23, Computer Crime Prevention Law. 
    22.1.6 Licensing Fees 
    Employees may not install any software for which the village has not paid the appropriate licensing fee. Additional licensing fees may be incurred every time software is installed for a new computer. Consequently, before software is installed on a computer, each employee has a duty to ensure that all appropriate licensing fees have been paid. 
    An employee may not copy software for distribution to any third party or for home use. 
    The installation of software for trial periods authorized by the vendor would not be a violation of this policy. 
    22.1.7 Encryption 
    Employees may not password protect or otherwise privately code their files without prior authorization from a department head. The employee's department head must specifically approve use of encryption software prior to using such software for storage, receipt, and transmission of data. If encryption software is used, the employee must give the password to his or her department head. 
    22.1.8 Viruses and Tampering 
    Any files downloaded from the Internet must be scanned with virus detection software before installation and execution. The intentional introduction of viruses, attempts to breach system security, or other unauthorized tampering with any of the village's electronic communication systems are expressly prohibited. An employee must immediately report any viruses, tampering, or other system breaches to a department head. 
    22.1.9 Disclaimer of Liability for Use of the Internet 
    The village is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by an employee from the Internet. The Internet provides access to a significant amount of information, some of which contains offensive, sexually explicit and inappropriate material. All employees must use all reasonable efforts to avoid contact with this material. Therefore, an employee using the Internet does so at his or her own risk and is responsible for the employee's own conduct. 
    22.1.10 Duty Not to Waste Electronic Communications Resources 
    An employee must not deliberately perform actions that waste electronic communications resources or unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of other employees. This includes, but is not limited to, subscribing to list servers, mailing lists, streaming video and audio or web sites not directly related to the employee's job responsibilities; spending extensive non-productive time on the Internet; and doing large non-work related file downloads, or mass mailings. Electronic communication resources are limited and employees have a duty to conserve these resources. 
    22.1.11 E-mail Addresses 
    The village reserves the right to monitor and keep an employee's e-mail address active for a reasonable period of time following an employee's departure to ensure that important business communications reach the village. 
    22.1.12 Violations 
    Violations of this policy may subject the employee to disciplinary action, including, but not limited to the removal of privileges, dismissal from employment, and/or, if applicable, any criminal or civil penalties or other legal action. 
    An employee who observes violations of this policy is obligated to report those violations to a department head. 
    22.1.13 Policy Changes 
    Revised policy changes will be made available to employees in a timely manner. 
    22.1.14 Village Administration Rights 
    This policy in no way limits or restricts the rights of the village Management Personnel or as otherwise allowed by statute, ordinance, regulation or law.

Sec. 2-257. - Copyright law protection policy. 
    25.1 Reproduction of Copyrighted Materials 
    The village recognizes and supports the copyright laws of the United States governing the making of photocopies and other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Each employee is hereby notified that the village will not provide legal support in a case in which an employee has notice that a potential infringement exists and the individual pursues utilization of the materials in a manner resulting in infringement. 
    Any reproduction of copyrighted materials will be done with the written permission of the copyright holder. The employee responsible for reproduction may be individually liable for any infringement of the copyright. 
    Any willful infringement of a copyright law may subject the employee to disciplinary action, including discharge of employment.

(Ord. No. 05-2018, 2-20-2018) 
Sec. 2-258. - Cellular policy. 
    The village has established a cellular telephone policy, which will define the proper use of cell phones. The village is committed to providing an environment that encourages the use of computers and electronic tools to support the village's business. It is the responsibility of each employee to ensure that this technology is used for proper business purpose and in a manner that does not compromise the confidentiality of proprietary or other sensitive information. The use of cell phones is a privilege and requires the users to be responsible and accountable for their actions at all times. 
    By using a cell phone issued by the village employees agree and understand that this technology has been provided by the village for use by its employees in business transactions/communications for the village. Village cell phones are provided to improve customer service (to residents and business associates) and to enhance business efficiency. Cell phones are not a personal benefit and should not be used as a primary mode of personal communication. Cell phones should not be used when a less costly alternative is safe, convenient and readily available. Department heads are responsible for reviewing all cell phone bills of their staff for proper reimbursement of personal calls beyond policy limits. The administration department will rely upon the department head's authorization for accuracy of personal vs. work-related calls. 
    Village employees in possession of company cellular phones are required to take precautions to prevent theft, vandalism and damage to Village equipment. Whenever an employee needs to have his/her cell phone serviced for any reason, they must complete the "Cell Phone Request Form". 
    Cell phone usage while operating a motorized vehicle is prohibited. 
    Employees who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of their phone while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities that result from such actions, and may be subject to disciplinary action by the village. 
    The following outlines the basic tenets of this policy: 
(1)  There should be no inappropriate messages that refer to race, gender, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or a protected class status as established by law. 
(2)  There shall be no harassment in any form. 
(3)  All sexually explicit materials including indecent images, cartoons or jokes are explicitly banned. 
(4)  Personal attacks on co-workers or business associates are prohibited, as is hate mail, vulgar or otherwise offensive language. 
(5)  The village reserves the right to review, audit and monitor its electronic equipment, including an employee's itemized cell phone usage, call history (incoming and outgoing) and phonebook entries at its discretion in the ordinary course of business. 
(6)  Unauthorized use of cellular phones includes: 
a.  Use for personal business or personal causes; 
b.  Use of unassigned equipment; 
c.  Misrepresenting one's identity; 
d.  Installing unauthorized programs or files; 
e.  Removing required business programs or files. 
(7)  Any employee who violates this policy shall be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment. 
(8)  The IRS considers personal use of a company-owned asset as a taxable fringe benefit. Cell phone usage that is for personal use may be deemed a taxable fringe benefit per IRS Publication 15-B Employer's Guide to Fringe Benefits and IRS Publication 525 Taxable and Nontaxable Income. Per IRS Publication 15-B, "any fringe benefit you provide is taxable and must be included in the receipt's pay unless the law specifically excludes it". 
a.  Minimal benefits: any property or service you provide to an employee that has so little value (taking into account how frequently you provide similar benefits to your employees) that accounting for it would be unreasonable or administratively impracticable. 
b.  No-additional-cost services: a service you provide to an employee if it does not cause you to incur any substantial additional costs. 
c.  Working condition benefits: property and services you provide to an employee so that the employee can perform his or her job. 
(9)  Department heads shall determine the cellular usage requirements for employees under their supervision and should limit assignment of the cell phone to employees who have a legitimate business need. 
(10)  Personal calls must be reimbursed (at the plan rate) with a check made payable to the village in the following instances: 
a.  Any assistance, roaming charges, non-business calls or other miscellaneous charges which are not clearly business related. 
    Village cell phones must be returned immediately after an employee has terminated their employment or after an elected official has ended their term.

If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the village treasurer. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the village treasurer, who may, in his or her discretion, determine that no further action is necessary. If the village treasurer, in his or her discretion, determines that further action is necessary, a village employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the village treasurer:

ARTICLE VII. - POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
State Law reference- This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act 100-0554. 

Sec. 2-541. - Prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Godfrey to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. 
(Ord. No. 02-2018, § 1(Exh. A, § 1), 1-4-2018) 
Sec. 2-542. - Definition of sexual harassment. 
(a)  This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as: 
(1)  Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when: 
a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, 
b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or 
c.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
(2)  Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes: 
a.  Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. 
b.  Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises. 
c.  Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites. 
d.  Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault. 
e.  Textual/electronic. "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter). 
(b)  The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a "reasonable person." 
(Ord. No. 02-2018, § 1(Exh. A, § 11), 1-4-2018) 
Sec. 2-543. - Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment. 
(a)  An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report. 
(b)  Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment, including the following: 
(1)  Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo. 
(2)  Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality. 
(c)  The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment. 
(d)  Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days. 
(e)  Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages. 
(f)  All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. 
(Ord. No. 02-2018, § 1(Exh. A, § III), 1-4-2018) 
Sec. 2-544. - Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment allegations. 
(a)  No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's: 
(1)  Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy; 
(2)  The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy; or 
(3)  Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy. 
(b)  For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy. 
(c)  No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation. 
(d)  Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following: 
(1)  Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation; 
(2)  Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state employee; or 
(3)  Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act. 
(e)  Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)). 
(f)  According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act. 
(g)  An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge-due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. 
(Ord. No. 02-2018, § 1(Exh. A, § IV), 1-4-2018) 
Sec. 2-545. - Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/565, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency. 
(Ord. No. 02-2018, § 1(Exh. A, § V), 1-4-2018) 
Sec. 2-546. - Consequences for knowingly making a false report. 
    A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements. 
    In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a state's attorney, the attorney general, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

For the purposes of this section 14-16, the term "chicken" is defined as a female/hen chicken. Chickens known as roosters shall not be kept within the village. The following restrictions shall apply to any property where chickens are kept, raised or maintained within R-1 residential districts within the village:

d.  The property must possess R-1, R-2 and R-3 residential zoning classification. No chickens many be raised, maintained or kept within zoning classifications other than R-1, R-2 and R-3 with the exception of those properties zoned Agricultural (AG) shall not be subject to the restrictions of this section 14-16. 
e.  Free-range chickens are not permitted. Free-range chickens, for the purpose of this section, are defined as chickens that are not restrained within a chicken coop or chicken run. 
f.  Chicken feed shall be kept in a predator proof/rodent proof sealable container and the chicken feeding bin shall be made of steel and be predator proof/rodent proof.

h.  No person shall allow chickens to produce noise which is loud enough to disturb the peace of persons on surrounding properties. 
i.  The owner of chickens shall ensure that the chickens are cared for in a safe and humane manner at all times and, in the event of death, that they are disposed of in a manner that does not endanger the public health and safety.

k.  No chickens may be kept, maintained or raised to be used for the purpose of fighting. 
l.  All coops shall be thoroughly cleaned of all debris, refuse, and waste as often as necessary to affect a sanitary maintenance of the premise and to prevent odors from emanating from the facility.

m.  The village animal control officers and the village planning and zoning officials or their designees, may inspect, at any time, the property, the permitted facilities and conditions where the chickens are kept to assure compliance with all village ordinances.

The wire enclosure or fencing around the run may not exceed six feet in height and all gates or doors to the fence and coop structure shall be locked and secured with a latch.

ARTICLE VI. - POLICIES FOR PROVIDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING ASSISTANCE 

Sec. 22-244. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this policy is to assist in attracting and retaining high quality development that is compatible with the long-range goals expressed in the strategic plan and compatible with land uses as outlined in the comprehensive land use plan. 
(Ord. No. 29-2004, § 1 9-22-2004) 
Sec. 22-245. - General policy. 
    The village may, at the village's discretion, provide financial or in kind assistance to new or existing commercial, industrial, or institutional development through the use of incremental and other revenues accruing to the village (and other taxing districts where a project is to be located within a TIF district). The village may assist developers in seeking state and federal incentive financing if requested. 
(Ord. No. 29-2004, § 1, 9-22-2004) 
Sec. 22-246. - Detailed policy. 
(a)  Economic incentives considered by the village must provide a demonstrable return to the village for the future investment of incremental tax revenue and will only be considered if the project would not be possible without this assistance. Incentives of other types can be considered when the direct result of the incentive is the encouragement of development which meets the village's goals and objectives. 
(b)  Requests for economic development assistance must be in the form of a completed application. That application should be accompanied by detailed financial information that demonstrates the developers projected revenue that the project is expected to generate. The basis for the financial estimates should be included. This information will be regarded as proprietary and will remain confidential. 
(c)  For projects that are requesting sales or property tax rebate incentives, only those village revenues which are directly accrued by the proposed project will be considered for use to assist the development or redevelopment activities and costs. These incremental revenues are those which result from the proposed project in excess of current village revenues being generated from the project site or area. 
(d)  Eligible project elements to be financed shall be limited to the actual costs of improvements or activities: 
(1)  Project costs which can be characterized as public improvements or of direct or indirect benefit to the public may include items such as: upgrade or installation of roads, water and sewer lines, storm water detention facilities, demolition of existing buildings, removal of existing infrastructure which is antiquated, removal or mitigation of hazardous materials or substances, removal or relocation of physical impediments to developing the land (i.e., underlying rock, canalization or relocation of storm water courses, major site grading to correct large topographic variations, etc.), costs associated with planning and engineering of the public improvements as defined above, including the village's planning and legal costs associated with implementation of the economic development assistance program for the project, and relocation of existing residents or businesses. 
(2)  Land acquisition costs include those which are over and above current market values for property suitable for commercial or industrial development due to factors such as added cost for the value of improvements which have no value to the planned project and the costs associated with the acquisition of property using the village's power of eminent domain. 
(e)  The applicant will demonstrate that but for financial assistance requested from the village, the project would not otherwise be carried out. The developer should provide an affidavit to such effect. 
(f)  Normally, not more than 25 percent of the total project cost will be supported by incentive revenues. Total project cost is the cost of development of the project including all land, site and public infrastructure, and building and site amenity costs necessary to constitute an operating commercial or industrial project. Financial assistance will not normally exceed 50 percent of the incremental village revenue to be generated by retail commercial uses and will be limited to a ten (10) year period. Financial assistance will not include interest on the developer's invested cost to which the incentive is being applied. 
(g)  For projects that generate sales tax revenues, a portion of the revenues generated and accruing to the village will be retained by the village. The percentage to be retained by the village will be determined through negotiations between the applicant and the village. 
(h)  For multi-phase projects or those having multiple buildings, assistance will be provided based on the overall development program and channeled through a single development agreement with the prime developer. No separate financial incentives or assistance to owners or developers of parcels that are sub-components of the primary project will be provided. 
(i)  All project assistance from the village will be provided based on a negotiated development project agreement between the village and the developer to be adopted by ordinance. That agreement will contain a cost recovery process to follow in the event that the assisted project fails prior to the completion of the period covered by the incentive. 
(j)  All projects for which city financial assistance is requested (except those within a TIF district) will be required to conform to the provisions of the Illinois business district development and redevelopment act (65 ILCS 5/11-74.3-1) and shall meet all of the stipulations and requirements therein. Projects proposed within a TIF District shall be subject to the provisions of the Illinois tax allocation redevelopment act (TIF Act, 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1) 
(k)  Projects which involve the relocation of an existing activity from one location to another within the boundaries of the village or involve the redevelopment of an existing activity shall have the incremental revenue generation amount based upon the amount in excess of the revenue previously accruing to the village at the existing location. 
(l)  Financial assistance provided by the village to reimburse eligible project costs shall be repaid to the developer based on a note agreement adopted by ordinance that is in concert with the provisions of any business district development and redevelopment plan and companion development agreement approved by the ordinances adopted for the specific project. This note shall not bear interest to the holder and shall not pledge any revenues of the village other than those incremental revenues generated by the project. The provisions of this policy may be modified or waived by the village board of trustees for projects within the boundaries of a TIF district. 
(m)  No assistance will be provided to any project for expenditures incurred prior to the adoption of the ordinances required to implement the project. 
(n)  The Village will require the developer to pay an application fee at the time of application to be applied toward the village legal and planning costs associated with the implementation of the economic development assistance program for the project. This application fee shall be in a minimum amount of $1500.00. $1000.00 constitutes a deposit, $500.00 is nonrefundable. An accurate estimate of the total amount of the Village's legal and planning costs associated with implementation of the project may be given to the applicant/developer in writing no less than 30 business days prior to the scheduled passage of the ordinance(s) implementing the project. Village legal and planning expenses in excess of $1000.00 will be billed to the applicant and are payable prior to village board of trustees final approval of an ordinance related to the development agreement. These expenses are an eligible project cost reimbursable to the applicant/developer via the incremental revenue payments made by the village. In the event that the village board of trustees does not adopt the ordinances as provided for above, any payment received by the village from the applicant in excess of actual expenses incurred by the village (minus the nonrefundable $500.00 application fee) shall be returned to the applicant. 
(o)  In addition to the policies set forth above, the following miscellaneous provisions should be noted by any applicant/developer seeking economic development financial assistance from the village in the form of incremental revenue reimbursement: 
(1)  The adoption of these policies by the village board of trustees in the form of an ordinance should not be construed to mean that the provision of financial incentives using incremental revenues to be generated by a proposed project shall be approved for any applicant and/or project that may be able to comply with the policies as set forth herein. Each project will be independently evaluated and subject to the goals of the village as determined from time to time. 
(2)  The village reserves the right to amend, modify, or withdraw these policies; revise any requirement of these policies; require additional statements, sworn affidavits as to the goals of these policies or any additional information from any applicant/developer, and further to negotiate or hold discussions with any applicant/developer and/or project which does not completely conform to the policies as set forth above, to waive any nonconformity with these policies, and to waive or modify any timetables established by ordinance, resolution or motion. 
(3)  Submission of an application for economic development assistance that complies with the spirit and intent of these policies does not commit the village to approval of the development/redevelopment project associated with said application. 
(p)  The village may exercise the foregoing rights at any time without notice and without liability to any applicant, developer and/or project or any other party for its expenses incurred in the preparation of an application for economic development assistance. The costs and preparation of any such application and related costs associated with responding to the village in its review of such application shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant/developer.

ARTICLE VII. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS 

Sec. 22-251. - Rationale and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the Village of Godfrey, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the village. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose, nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent, nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings and Rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Godfrey, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of Village of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 124 S.Ct. 2219 (June 7, 2004); Village of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v. Village of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Village of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); 
World Wide Video of Washington, Inc. v. Village of Spokane, 368 F.3d 1186 (9 th Cir. 2004); Ben's Bar, Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702 (7 th Cir. 2003); 
and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma Village, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); 
The Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Godfrey finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the village has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the Village of Godfrey's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the Village of Godfrey's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the village. The village finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 01-2008, § 1, adopted Feb. 4, 2008, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article II, §§ 29-31-29-38, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 44-2001, adopted Oct. 2, 2001. For stylistic purposes renumbering of sections was done at the editor's discretion. Sections 1.0-8.2 were renumbered as 29-31-29-38. 

Sec. 29-31. - Authority and purpose; other relevant permitting; applicability; exemptions; exceptions; separability. 
(a)  Authority and purpose. 
(1)  This article is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the Village of Godfrey, Illinois, by the 65 ILCS 5/11-12-4, 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-5, 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq. 
(2)  The purpose of this article is to diminish threats to public health and safety, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any new development or redevelopment or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth, and/or changes the stormwater drainage pattern and/or stormwater flows from that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural state. This stormwater runoff and resulting soil erosion could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. This article regulates these activities to minimize adverse impacts. 
The purpose of this article is also to comply with the General National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit No. ILR40 regulations, the notice of intent (NOI) submitted to the IEPA in 2003. 
(3)  This article is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
a.  To assure that new development or redevelopment does not increase the drainage or flood hazards, or create unstable conditions susceptible to soil erosion; 
b.  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff and soil erosion; 
c.  To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding and soil erosion on a watershed basis; 
d.  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by stormwater runoff and soil erosion quantities from new development or redevelopment; 
e.  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and soil, water, air, animal, and plant resources; 
f.  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
g.  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to manage flood and stormwater impacts, improve water and groundwater quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, maintain quality forest resources, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits, enhance community and economic development. 
(b)  Other relevant permitting. Before a development permit under this article becomes effective, all required federal, state, and local permits will have been officially approved. The acquisition of these permits shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant. These may include, but are not limited to; section 404 of the Clean Waters Act, section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, or permitting required by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources in accordance with the Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act, 615 ILCS, the Soil and Water Conservation Districts Act, 70 ILCS, the Farmland Preservation Act, 505 ILCS the Illinois Groundwater Protection Act, 415 ILCS and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES) thru the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Water Pollution Control.

    Final grade: The vertical location of the ground surface after grading work is completed in accordance with the engineering plans. 
    Flood fringe: That area as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on either side of the flood way. This area is subject to inundation from the base flood but conveys little or no flow. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): a very generalized map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which shows only where floodplains are located based on very basic data. FHBM's do not include base flood elevations. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): A map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that depicts the special flood hazard area (SFHA) within a community. This map includes insurance rate zones and regulatory floodplains and may or may not depict regulatory flood ways. 
    Floodplain: That land adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations at or below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood elevation which is subject to inundation. The floodplain as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is also known as the special flood hazard area (SFHA). These areas can be found on the (FIRM), flood boundary and flood way map, or the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) of the community. This area is the collective combination of the regulatory flood way and the flood fringe. 
    Flood way: The channel and that portion of the floodplain, including on-stream lakes, adjacent to a stream or watercourse which is needed to store and convey the anticipated existing and future 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to any loss of flood conveyance or storage and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities. Flood ways are designated by FEMA on some flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and flood way maps. However, there are flood ways on all streams whether mapped by FEMA or not. 
    Grading: The excavation or fill or any combination thereof and shall include the conditions resulting from any excavation or fill. 
    Hydrograph: A graph showing for a given location on a stream or conduit, the flow rate with respect to time. 
    Hydrograph method: This method estimates runoff volume and runoff hydrographs for the point of interest by generating hydrographs for individual sub areas, combining them, and routing them through stream lengths and reservoir structures. Factors such as rainfall amount and distribution, runoff curve number, time of concentration, and travel time are included. 
    Impervious surface: That area of property that is covered by materials other than soil and vegetation and that has no intended capacity to absorb water, such as parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, patios, tennis courts, roofs and other structures. 
    Infiltration: The passage or movement of water into the soil surfaces. 
    Loessal soil: A sediment, commonly nonstratified and unconsolidated, composed predominately of silt sized particles with accessory clay and sand. 
    Lot: An individual platted parcel in an approved subdivision. 
    Major drainage system: That portion of a drainage system needed to store and convey flows beyond the capacity of the minor drainage system. 
    Minor drainage system: That portion of a drainage system designed for the convenience of the public. It consists of street gutters, storm sewers, small open channels, and swales and, where manmade, is to be designed to handle the two-year runoff event. 
    Mitigation: Mitigation is when the prescribed controls are not sufficient and additional measures are required to offset the development, including those measures necessary to minimize the negative effects which stormwater drainage and development activities might have on the public health, safety and welfare. Examples of mitigation include, but are not limited to; compensatory storage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and channel restoration. 
    Modified rational method: As described in the Illinois Department of Transportation "Drainage Manual" is based on the principal that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area occurs at that point in time when all parts of the watershed are contributing to the flow. The rainfall generating the peak flow is assumed to be of uniform intensity for the entire watershed with a rainfall duration equal to the time of concentration. 
    Natural: Conditions resulting from physical, chemical, and biological processes without intervention by man. 
    Natural drainage: Channels formed in the existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by unnatural causes. 
    100-year event: A rainfall, runoff, or flood event having a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. A 24-hour storm duration is assumed unless otherwise noted. 
    Parcel: All contiguous land in one ownership. 
    Peak flow: The maximum rate of flow of water at a given point in a channel or conduit. 
    Permittee: Any person to whom a building permit is issued. 
    Person: Any individual, firm or corporation, public or private, the State of Illinois and its agencies or political subdivisions, the United States of America, and its agencies or political subdivisions, and any agent, servant, officer or employee of any of the foregoing. 
    Positive drainage: Provision for overland paths for all areas of a property including depressional areas that may also be drained by storm sewer. 
    Prime farmland: Prime farmland is land that is best suited to food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. It may be cropland, pasture, woodland, or other land, but it is not urban and built up land or water areas. It is either used for food or fiber or is available for those uses. The soil qualities, growing season and moisture supply are those needed for a well managed soil to economically produce a sustained high yield of crops. Prime farmland produces the highest yields with minimum inputs of energy and economic resources, and farming it results in the least damage to the environment. 
    Property: A parcel of real estate. 
    Retention basin: A facility designed to completely retain a specified amount of stormwater runoff without release except by means of evaporation, infiltration, emergency bypass or pumping. 
    Sedimentation: The process that deposits soils, debris, and other materials either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or stormwater drainage systems. 
    Site: A parcel of land, or a contiguous combination thereof, where grading work is performed as a single unified operation. 
    Sinkhole (karst areas): A sinkhole or karst topography is a land surface depression or blind valley which may or may not have surface openings to cavernous underground areas and are the result of water movement through silts and jointed limestone. These conditions make such areas unstable and susceptible to subsidence and surface collapse. Fractures in the limestone may channel runoff water to public or private water supplies, making those sources especially susceptible to groundwater contamination. 
    Slope disturbance line: The line which delineates relatively level building areas from areas where slopes exceed eight percent and where special precautions must be taken. 
    Stormwater drainage system: All means, natural and manmade, used for conducting stormwater to, through or from a drainage area to the point of final outlet from a property. The stormwater drainage system includes, but is not limited to; any of the following: conduits and appurtenance features, canals, channels, ditches, streams, culverts, streets, storm sewers, detention basins, swales and pumping stations. 
    Stormwater runoff: The waters derived from melting snow or rain falling within a tributary drainage basin which are in excess of the infiltration capacity of the soils of that basin, which flow over the surface of the ground or are collected in channels or conduits. 
    Storm sewer: A closed conduit for conveying collected stormwater. 
    Stream: Any river, creek, brook, branch, flowage, ravine, or natural or manmade drainage way which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either perennially or intermittently. 
    Stripping: Any activity which removes the vegetative surface cover including tree removal, by spraying or clearing, and storage or removal of top soil. 
    Ten-year event: A runoff, rainfall, or flood event having a ten percent chance of occurring in any given year. A 24-hour storm duration is assumed unless otherwise noted. 
    Time of concentration: The elapsed time for stormwater to flow from the most hydraulically remote point in a drainage basin to a particular point of interest in that watershed. 
    Tributary watershed: All of the land surface area that contributes runoff to a given point. 
    Two-year event: A runoff, rainfall, or flood event having a 50 percent chance of occurring in any given year. A 24-hour storm duration is assumed unless otherwise noted. 
    Vacant: Land on which there are no structures or only structures which are secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself. 
    Watershed: All land area drained by, or contributing water to, the same stream, creek, ditch, lake, marsh, stormwater facility, groundwater or depressional area. 
    Wet basin: A detention basin designed to maintain a permanent pool of water after the temporary storage of stormwater runoff. 
    Wetlands: Wetlands are defined by regulation as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions." For general, but not inclusive locations of designated wetlands refer to mapping prepared jointly by the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Resource Conservation; National Wetlands Inventory Mapping, 1987. The applicant may be required to provide a field investigation by a qualified wetland delineator.

(b)  Minimization of increases in runoff volumes and rates. In the selection of a drainage plan for a new development or redevelopment, the applicant shall evaluate and implement site design features which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which are consistent with the following hierarchy: 
(1)  Preservation of regulatory floodplains, flood prone and wetland areas; 
(2)  Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the needs of the project;

(c)  Water quality and multiple uses. The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse surface and groundwater quality impacts off-site and on the property itself. Water quality shall adhere to: 
(1)  Illinois Environmental Protection Act - 415 ILCS 5/12, from Ch.111 1/2., par. 1011 and 1012; 
(2)  Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations - Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part 302 Water Quality Standards; and 
(3)  Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations - Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part 304 Effluent Standards. 
Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. When designers propose wet bottom and wetland-type designs, all flows from the development shall be routed through the basin (i.e. low flows shall not be bypassed). When it is not practical or feasible to route all of the project's flow to the detention basin, the design of the basin shall compensate for the bypass flow. In cases where detention facilities are practical and the long-term maintenance of such facilities are provided for, detention of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. 
The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, fishing, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. 
(d)  Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(1)  Release rates. The drainage system for new developments or redevelopments shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the two-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to discharge rates at or below those which existed prior to development. Additionally, the discharge from a stormwater detention facility shall not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. 
a.  Detention basin outlet design. The detention basin outlet control structure shall be designed to account for observed or anticipated downstream tailwater elevations. The tailwater elevations used in the detention model shall be for the particular storm frequency being routed through the detention basin. An emergency spillway or overflow device shall be provided and set at an elevation equivalent to the 100-year design high water. 
A calculation shall be made to determine the water elevation in the detention basin that would result from a 100-year storm with the outflow control structure openings blocked. The discharge rate flowing through the emergency spillway shall not exceed the 100-year predevelopment flow rate. The top of bank for the detention basin shall be set at least one foot above this elevation. The lowest finished floor elevation of adjacent structures shall also be at least one foot above the detention basin top of bank. 
(2)  Detention storage requirements. See subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
(3)  Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria should be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The design will provide capacity to pass the ten-year peak flow rate in the minor drainage system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
a.  Design methodologies: Detention basin design shall be calculated using SCS TR-55 methods. Basins with drainage areas of ten acres or less may be calculated using the rational method as approved by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Other applicable methods, i.e. HEC-1, TR-20, SWMM, etc., shall be used for large watersheds. 
b.  Positive drainage: Whenever practicable, all developments must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year, 24-hour event flow at a stage at least one foot below the lowest grade, adjacent to a structure, in the vicinity of the flow path. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights. 
(4)  Rainfall. Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with, critical durations less than or equal to six hours. The second quartile distribution shall be used for storms with durations greater than six hours and less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems, with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin 70. Refer to Table 13 of Bulletin 70 for rainfall depth, duration, and frequency. The NRCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. The total rainfall value for the design storm shall be adjusted for the "St. Louis Urban Effect" as given in Table 4, Illinois State Water Survey Circular 172. 
(5)  Antecedent moisture. Average antecedent moisture conditions shall be assumed when calculating runoff curve numbers for use in the SCS TR-55 method. 
(6)  Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
a.  Wet basin depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep, excluding near-shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least eight feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winterkill. 
b.  Wet basin shoreline slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than three to one horizontal to vertical. It is recommended that aquatic vegetation be established around the perimeter to provide protection from shoreline erosion. For basins in excess of five acres, riprap shoreline protection shall be provided. 
c.  Permanent pool volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall, at a minimum, be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year, 24-hour event (calculated during dry weather conditions). 
d.  Wet basin inlet and outlet orientation: The distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the basin providing that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on topography or other natural constraints. 
(7)  Dry detention basin design. In addition to the other requirements of this article, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. Paved low flow channels may be used in a dry basin provided provisions are made to prevent ponding. 
a.  Dry basin drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year, 24-hour event. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet portion of the basin bottom. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. 
b.  Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize resuspension of pollutants. 
c.  Dry basin inlet and outlet orientation: Shall be the same as subsection (d)(6)d. 
(8)  Existing depressional areas. Existing depressional storage volume will be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this article shall be in addition to existing storage. 
(9)  Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of twelve inches for larger basins. Smaller basins may install a smaller rectangular or v-notch wire to control discharge. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical alternative, outlets, structures such as perforated risers, or flow control orifices shall be used. 
(10)  Detention in floodplains. The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this article may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met as well as compliance with subsection 29-31(b). 
a.  Detention in flood fringe areas: The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream-flow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the existing ten-year elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the existing ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse and comply with subsection 29-31(b). 
b.  Detention on prime farmland: The placement of detention basins shall avoid the utilization of prime farmland. All detention basin construction shall examine potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address measures that will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with subsection 29-31(b). 
c.  Detention in flood ways: Detention basins shall be placed in the flood way only in accordance with subsection (d)(10) of this section. 
d.  On-stream detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this article with respect to water quality and control of the 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in subsection (e) of this section. If on-stream detention is used in watersheds larger than one square mile, the applicant will use hydrographic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase the water level for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
1.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
2.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
3.  Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
4.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
5.  Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall include as a minimum: runoff reduction "Best Management Practices" (BMP's) consistent with subsection (b) of this section; two-year, 24-hour detention/sedimentation basins for all development consistent with subsection (d)(10)d. of this section; 
6.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and 
7.  Shall not contribute to the duration or flood frequency of any adjacent land. 
8.  Shall comply with subsection 29-31(b). 
(11)  Drainage into wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and depressional storage areas. Wetlands, lakes, ponds and depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this article, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas: 
a.  Detention in wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas: Existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions and shall comply with subsection 29-31(b). Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage. 
b.  Sediment control: The existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, or depressional storage areas shall be protected during construction and as further regulated in section 29-34 of this article. 
c.  Alteration of drainage patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas. 
d.  Detention/sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the wetland, river, lake, pond, or depressional storage area. This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins and shall be maintained throughout the construction process. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in subsection (b) should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland, river, stream, lake, pond, or depressional storage area and as further regulated in and subsection 29-33(d) of this article. 
e.  Loessal soils: Care must be taken to avoid open flow discharges of stormwater over silt (loessal) soils due to high potential for erosion. 
f.  Sinkholes, karst area: The following requirements apply for new developments or redevelopments where sinkholes are determined to be present: 
1.  A stormwater detention basin shall not be placed in or over a sinkhole. 
2.  Stormwater detention basins shall not be located closer than 100 feet from the rim of a sinkhole. 
3.  The outflow from a stormwater detention basin, channel, ditch or any stormwater runoff generated as a result of a new development or redevelopment shall not empty into or be directed, redirected by any means into or through any sinkhole. 
4.  If, after the review of the stormwater drainage plan, the village engineer may determine that more detailed information is required, a sinkhole evaluation may be required. A sinkhole evaluation which addresses the geologic, engineering and environmental factors resulting from a new development or redevelopment be performed by a professional with experience and expertise in karst topography, whom shall certify the results of the evaluation. This evaluation shall be the responsibility of the applicant and performed at no cost to the village. After a review of this evaluation and with the consultation of the county soil and water conservation district, the building and zoning administrator of the village may either approve or disapprove the drainage plan as submitted. 
5.  Whenever a new sinkhole appears or it becomes apparent that the sinkhole has not yet been identified, it shall be reported to the county soil and water conservation district. 
6.  Shall comply with subsection 29-31(b). 
(12)  Street detention, parking lot detention, and culvert drainage. 
a.  Street detention. If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights and shall not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year, 24-hour event. 
b.  Parking lot detention. The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed six inches for more than four hours. 
c.  Culvert, road and driveway crossings. Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. 
(13)  Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located in hydrologic soil groups "A" and "B" as designated by the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within 75 feet of a water supply well or building foundation and comply with subsection 29-31(b). A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80 percent of the dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of infiltration basins or trenches shall be a minimum of four feet above the seasonally high groundwater and bedrock level. Engineering calculations demonstrating infiltration rates shall be included with the application. 
a.  Vegetated filter strips and swales. To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Whenever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and swales comprised of native grasses and forbs before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin. 
(14)  Safety considerations. The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events and shall comply with subsection 29-31(b). 
a.  Side slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year, 24-hour capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one horizontal to vertical. 
b.  Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet in width 2.5 to three feet below the normal water depth. 
c.  Velocity. Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow. 
d.  Overflow structures. See subsection (d)(1)a. of this section. 
(15)  Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible. Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(e)  Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed. 
(1)  Upstream areas not meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this article, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall may be explored by the applicant or the village. When it is deemed beneficial by the village or the applicant to explore such a design, the following steps shall be followed: 
a.  The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the release rates of subsection (d) of this section, the applicant's property area, and the procedures described in subsection (c) of this section. 
b.  Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this article, shall be identified. 
c.  Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed. 
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in subsection (d) of this section. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of computing storage. 
Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the village may choose to pay for over-sizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed above. If regional storage is selected by the village, then the design produced in subsection (c) of this section shall be implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the village, the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one-square mile in size, the applicant must meet the provision of subsection 29-33(d)(10)d. for on-stream basins. 
(2)  Upstream areas meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this article, tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the applicant's property shall be computed as described in subsection (e)(1) of this section. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time will the release rate from the combined property exceed the allowable release rate for applicant's property alone. 
(f)  Early completion of detention facilities. Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant on a regular basis and before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 01-2008, § 1, 2-4-2008) 
Sec. 29-34. - Soil erosion and sediment control. 
(a)  Findings. The village hereby finds that: 
(1)  The soil types found in the village are susceptible to erosion and if left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property; 
(2)  The topography of the village contains areas with steep slopes upon which, if clearing of trees and/or inappropriate construction takes place, could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in damage to property; 
(3)  Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including, but not limited to; the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and drainage ways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
(4)  The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
(5)  Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed out fills, and embankments; 
(6)  Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, sinkholes, wetlands, and reservoirs; 
(7)  Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and 
(8)  Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety. 
(b)  General principles. It is the objective of this article to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the village. 
(1)  Water quality shall adhere to: 
a.  Illinois Environmental Protection Act - 415 ILCS 5/12, from Ch.111 1/2, par. 1011 and 1012; 
b.  Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations - Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part 302 Water Quality Standards; and 
c.  Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations - Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board, Part 304 Effluent Standards. 
(2)  Measures taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment runoff shall be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year, 24-hour frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all new development or redevelopment activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under subsection (c) of this section: 
a.  New development or redevelopment shall be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes greater than 33 percent where high cuts and fills may be required are to be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
b.  Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, sinkholes, and wetlands are to be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures. 
c.  Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond, sinkhole or wetland. Preventive measures shall reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation. 
d.  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development.

Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
f.  Site development requirements. On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed as specified in the referenced handbooks, and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site: 
1.  For new developments or redevelopments less than one acre, or for a tract of land where a single-family dwelling is being erected and less than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface is being developed, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all on-site runoff. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
2.  For new developments or redevelopments more than one acre but less than five acres, a sediment trap designed in accordance with the IEPA Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
3.  For new developments or redevelopments greater than five acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
4.  Sediment basin and sediment trap designs shall provide for both "dry" detention and "wet" detention sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage and each shall be sized as regulated in section 29-33. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate as regulated in section 29-33. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
5.  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume or sediment generated in one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the one-year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. 
6.  The alteration of sinkholes by filling, grading or excavation is prohibited, including an area within 25 feet from the rim. 
7.  To the extent possible or as otherwise regulated in this article, all desirable trees eight inches in diameter and larger shall be protected for their present and future value for erosion protection and other environmental benefits. Trees that have been selected for preservation shall be marked prior to the beginning of any clearing, grading, stripping, excavation, or filling of the site. A "No" construction zone shall be established and marked at the perimeter of the drip line of each tree which is to be preserved. 
g.  Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed as regulated in section 29-33. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within 48 hours, consistent with the standards as required in the IEPA Erosion Control Manual "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control". 
h.  Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible, or as regulated in section 29-33. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met: 
1.  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
2.  The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be stabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped. 
i.  Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
j.  Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway, drainage channel, or sinkhole. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles. 
k.  If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent and shall not be deposited into a sinkhole. 
l.  Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
(e)  Maintenance of control measures. All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this article shall be maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance.

Sec. 29-35. - Long-term maintenance responsibility. 
    Maintenance of stormwater drainage, and erosion and sediment control facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before an appropriate permit is obtained from the village, the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the village guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of Madison County, Illinois. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the village. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the appropriate personnel of the village notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall begin such corrections within 24 hours and shall not extend beyond seven calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period the village may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner. The village has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control system. 
(Ord. No. 01-2008, § 1, 2-4-2008) 
Sec. 29-36. - Inspections. 
(a)  Inspections. 
(1)  The village engineer shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee; wherein the work fails to comply with the stormwater drainage or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of approval of the village engineer shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with this article, the permittee shall notify the village engineer within two working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below: 
a.  Upon completion of installation of the stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment control measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance or grading; 
b.  After stripping and clearing; 
c.  After rough grading; 
d.  After final grading; 
e.  After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and 
f.  After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of sediment controls. 
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five working days after notice is received by the village from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without presuming acceptance by the village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the site. 
(2)  Inspection reports. The permittee shall perform required inspections and maintain necessary reports according to their stormwater pollution prevention plan and NPDES permit, as prepared by qualified personnel, including whether drainage construction and erosion control has been installed in accordance with construction plans. Report shall define whether maintenance has been provided as needed for the erosion control. 
(b)  Special precautions. If at any stage of the grading of any development site the village engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the village engineer may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to; a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work. 
Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village engineer may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
(c)  Amendment of plans. Major amendments to stormwater drainage and detention or erosion and sediment control plans shall be submitted to the building and zoning administrator and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modification of a minor nature may be authorized by the village engineer by written authorization to the permittee. 
(Ord. No. 01-2008, § 1, 2-4-2008) 
Sec. 29-37. - Permitting.

No permit fee is assessed for those developments where only the requirements of section 29-34, soil erosion and sediment control, apply. Each application shall include certification that any land clearing, construction, or development involving the movement of earth shall be in accordance with the plans approved upon issuance of the permit. 
(b)  Bond required. The applicant for a development permit may be required to file with the village a faithful performance bond or bonds, letter of credit, or other improvement security satisfactory to the village attorney in an amount deemed sufficient by the village engineer to cover all costs of improvements, landscaping, maintenance of improvements and landscaping, and soil erosion and sediment control measures for such period as specified by the village, and engineering and inspection costs to cover the cost of failure or repair of improvements installed on the site. 
(c)  Review and approval. Each application for a development permit shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures: 
(1)  The building and zoning administrator will review each application for a development permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this article. The administrator shall refer applications to the village engineer for review and approval and may also refer any application to the county soil and water conservation district or a consulting engineer retained by the village. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the building and zoning administrator shall in writing: 
a.  Approve the permit application if it is found to be in conformance with the provisions of this article, and issue the permit; 
b.  Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this article, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or 
c.  Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission. 
(2)  No development permit shall be issued for an intended development site unless: 
a.  The development, including, but not limited to, subdivision or planned unit development, has been approved by the village, where applicable; or 
b.  Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building permit issued by the village; or 
c.  The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall development program previously approved by the village for the area in which the site is situated; and 
d.  All relevant federal and state permits have been received for the portion of the site subject to soil disturbance as noted in subsection 29-31(b). 
(3)  Failure of the building and zoning administrator to act on an original or revised application within 30 days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in accordance with the plans as filed and in compliance with the regulations contained herein, unless such time is extended by agreement between the building and zoning administrator and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance with conditions established by the building and zoning administrator. 
(d)  Final certification. Prior to final approval by the village, the village engineer or another registered professional engineer shall certify that detention basin has been constructed in accordance with construction plans and proposed volume has been provided. An "as-built" survey of the detention basin, prepared by a licensed surveyor, shall be included with the certification for approval. 
(e)  Expiration of permit. Every development permit shall expire and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within 180 days, or if not completed by a date which shall be specified in the permit; except that the building and zoning administrator may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit. The building and zoning administrator may require modification of the erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion or off-site sediment runoff resulting from any extension. 
(f)  Appeals. The applicant, or any person or agency that received notice of the filing of the application, may appeal the decision of the building and zoning administrator to the planning and zoning commission of the village. Upon receipt of an appeal, the planning and zoning commission of the village shall schedule and hold a public hearing at their next regularly scheduled meeting, after giving 15 days' notice thereof. The planning and zoning commission shall render a recommendation within 30 days after the hearing to the board of trustees and the board of trustees of the village shall enter a final decision on the appeal within 30 days after receipt of said recommendation. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but need not be limited to, the effects of the proposed development activities on the surface water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any comprehensive watershed management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the proposed development activities may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or removal of vegetation.

Development does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar practices that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees. 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood insurance rate map means a map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (SFHA) within the village. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or may not depict floodways and show base flood elevations. 
    Flood protection elevation or FPE means the elevation of the base flood plus one foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain. 
    Floodplain and special flood hazard area (SFHA) are synonymous and mean those lands within the jurisdiction of the village that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of the village are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate maps of the county prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated April 15, 1982. The floodplains of those parts of the unincorporated village that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for Madison County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated April 15, 1982.

    NFIP means the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Repetitive loss means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    SFHA means as defined in "Floodplain." 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state register of historic places.

Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to have been higher than the base flood elevation, as of the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification, is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this article. The building code enforcement official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(Ord. No. 30-2002, § 1, 9-17-2002)

(b)  If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation: 
(1)  The village may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this article or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this article. 
(2)  Any person who violates this article shall, upon conviction, be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-10. 
(c)  The zoning administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All connected costs shall accrue to the person responsible. 
(Ord. No. 30-2002, § 1, 9-17-2002) 
Sec. 34-42. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village board to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. However, this article does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this article repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this article and other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This article shall not abrogate or repeal Ordinance No. 37-99 in any respect.

Sec. 58-103. - Regulations. 
    In the operation or maintenance of any place for the disposal of garbage in the village or within one mile of the village limits, all of the following rules and regulations shall be complied with: 
(1)  All garbage and other refuse shall be thoroughly compacted by equipment of a size and weight capable of producing a downward or ground pressure of at least five pounds per square inch. Such equipment shall have sufficient weight and capacity to carry out all necessary operations to the satisfaction of the enforcement officer. Sufficient auxiliary equipment shall be maintained on the site or otherwise available to permit operation in case of a breakdown. 
(2)  Mixed refuse material shall be spread out on the working face of the landfill so that the depth does not exceed a maximum depth of two feet prior to its compaction. 
(3)  The areas shall be continually policed to prevent fire and the blowing of papers; shall be neat and sanitary at all times; and shall be covered at the end of each day's operation, as well as when wind conditions warrant it through the day, with sufficient material to prevent blowing papers and unsightly conditions. The size of the active face on which refuse is being currently deposited shall be kept to a minimum. 
(4)  Cover material will consist of earth, loam, clay, sand, etc., or a mixture of at least 50 percent earth and other inert materials, such as ashes, cinders or gravel. A minimum depth of 12 inches of compacted cover and spread cover material shall be kept on all inactive faces of the landfill at all times. The active faces of the landfills should be covered at the end of each day's operation with at least six inches (before compaction) of cover material. 
(5)  When the fill has been brought up to two feet below the desired finished grade, it shall be covered with at least 24 inches of compacted cover material, graded and seeded in such a manner as to prevent erosion. 
(6)  Where the trench system of sanitary landfill is used, successive parallel trenches must be at least two feet apart. 
(7)  All garbage and refuse material existing on the site at the time the permit is issued either in the form of an open dump or any other form shall be collected, compacted and covered with cover material at least one foot in depth if below the desired finished grade or with inert material at least two feet in depth at the finished grade. This cover operation shall be completed within 15 working days after the issuance of a special permit for the sanitary landfill. 
(8)  The licensee or operator shall erect such temporary or permanent fences or take such other measures as may be necessary to control blowing of paper and other materials from the landfill. 
(9)  Any materials salvaged from the fill must be stored in a building on or off the site in such a manner as to prevent rat harborage and permit proper operation of the landfill. Such storage building must be at least 200 feet from the working surface so as not to interfere with the compacting and covering. All salvaged material must be daily placed within the building provided so that none is left uncovered during the night or on weekends. 
(10)  No materials deposited in the landfill shall be burned there or anywhere else in the village. 
(11)  Adequate firefighting equipment shall be available at all times on the site. 
(12)  No sanitary landfill operation shall be placed where seepage, drainage or pumping of any material from the fill of such a nature as would constitute an odor nuisance or health hazard flows into a watercourse unless provision is made to treat such effluent in such a manner as to purify it to acceptable standards as set forth by the state sanitary water board. 
(13)  The licensee shall provide an access road approved by the zoning administrator that is passable in all types of weather conditions to the landfill site. 
(14)  The licensee shall also have available necessary equipment to ensure that the traffic may be maintained on the access road during periods of heavy rain or snowfall. The licensee shall also take precautions to eliminate excess dust in dry weather during operation of the landfill. 
(15)  Insects and rodents on the landfill site shall be controlled and exterminated as directed by the zoning administrator. 
(16)  No person shall dispose of any hazardous waste or hazardous materials anywhere in the village. As used in this subsection, the terms "hazardous waste" and "hazardous materials" mean any explosives and any radioactive material. The term "radioactive material" shall mean any material or combination of materials which spontaneously emits ionizing radiation. Materials in which the estimated specific activity is not greater than 0.002 microcurie per gram of material, and in which the radioactivity is essentially evenly distributed, are not considered to be radioactive materials.

An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities, if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(6)  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any provision, condition, or requirement contained in this article. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7)  Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information, and notices to the village by personal delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked no later than the date due, or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail, by which the application is received by the village no later than the date due. 
(c)  Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1)  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both (or all three) uses. 
(2)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents, and/or contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards, laws, and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph (or the then applicable regulations). Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving such space and/or the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, as amended from time to time. 
(5)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, and with reasonable stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in any village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, the village's comprehensive plan, and any other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including those applicable to historic landmarks and/or historic districts. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as reasonably determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification to the village describing the property rights, technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. if an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a special use permit or variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the village building and zoning code. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void, unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(d)  Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows: 
(1)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650.00 for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures. 
(2)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable. 
(4)  The village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with subsection d. under the section titled "application requirements"; or 
c.  The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles, so long as such installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement is in compliance with all applicable safety codes. 
(5)  Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures. 
(e)  Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this article authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on: 
(1)  Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner; 
(2)  Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or conservation purposes, without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or 
(3)  Property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, any public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this article do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this article shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this article. 
(f)  Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, if any, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this article. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village on the effective date of the Act may opt, instead, to accept the rates, fees, and terms that the village makes available under this article for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities by submitting a completed application for such small wireless facilities no sooner than two years after the effective date of the Act, along with a notification to the village that the wireless provider opts to accept the rates, fees, and terms hereunder, rather than under its existing agreement. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph. 
(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) $200.00 per year or (ii) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village utility pole. 
If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be $200.00 payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. If the village has billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs prior to such annual anniversary, the fee shall be such actual and direct costs; and shall be paid (i) no later than the annual anniversary date, or (ii) within ten business days after the village has provided such actual and direct costs to the wireless provider, whichever is later. 
(h)  Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. 
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery, and charge the wireless provider for all costs incurred in such removal. 
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider. 
(Ord. No. 11-2018, § 3, 7-3-2018) 
Sec. 62-194. - Dispute resolution. 
    The Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than $200.00 per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute. 
(Ord. No. 11-2018, § 4, 7-3-2018) 
Sec. 62-195. - Indemnification.

A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on any theory of liability. 
(Ord. No. 11-2018, § 5, 7-3-2018) 
Sec. 62-196. - Insurance. 
    The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: 
(1)  Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all risks; 
(2)  Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or 
(3)  Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage. 
    The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
    A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the foregoing.

A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

(7)  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made); 
(8)  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices; or 
(9)  Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act. 
    Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this state. 
    Intrastate telecommunications means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within this state. 
    Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the federal and state governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this state. 
    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.

    Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this article. 
    Telecommunications, in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act. 
(Ord. No. 25-2002, § 3, 8-6-2002) 
Sec. 70-102. - Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed. 
    A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges: 
(1)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of five percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. 
(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of five percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state. 
(3)  The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the municipality. 
(Ord. No. 25-2002, § 3, 8-6-2002) 
Sec. 70-103. - Collection of tax by retailers. 
(a)  The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications. 
(Ord. No. 25-2002, § 3, 8-6-2002) 
Sec. 70-104. - Returns to department.

(Ord. No. 25-2002, § 3, 8-6-2002) 
Sec. 70-105. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(Ord. No. 25-2002, § 3, 8-6-2002) 
Sec. 70-106. - Revival. 
    If Illinois Public Act 92-0526, entitled the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, or if this article is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, then Ordinance No. 44-97, [formerly] codified as article III of this chapter, shall be deemed in full force and as of the date Public Act 92-0526 or the date this article is repealed or becomes ineffective.

Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this article.

(e)  However, no building or structure lawfully erected or any use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall be required to provide such additional parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units of measurement equals not less than 15 percent of the units of measurement existing upon the effective date of this Ordinance, in which case parking or loading facilities as required herein shall be required for the total increase. 
(f)  Whenever the existing use of a building, structure, premises or zoning lot is hereafter changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. 
(g)  Any nonconforming building, structure or use which is in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance and is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion or other casualty and is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance may be continued in operation with parking or loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the time of such casualty or destruction. 
(h)  Off-street parking lots or loading areas which are located on the same lot as an establishment, building, structure or use served by the parking or loading facility and were in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance or were provided voluntarily after the effective date, shall not thereafter be reduced below, or if presently less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements of this Ordinance for a similar new building, structure or use.

Section 60.906. - Special uses. 
    Section 60.906.1 Purpose. 
    The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive ordinance is based on the division of the entire village into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district, but which, on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this Ordinance as "special uses" and fall into three categories as follows: 
(a)  Uses operated by the village or other government or operated by publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected by public interest; 
(b)  Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their peculiar location and the nature of the service they offer to the public and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood, may have to be established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under zoning regulations; 
(c)  Nonconforming uses which as special uses can be made more compatible with their surroundings. 
    Special uses are identified for each zoning district in the portions of this Ordinance establishing those districts. 
(Ord. No. 07-2009, 3-3-2009) 
    Section 60.906.2. Performance standards. 
    All uses established by a special use permit shall operate in accord with performance standards applicable to the zoning district in which the special use is to occur. These performance standards are minimum requirements and may be made more restrictive in the conditions governing the particular development or use authorized by special use permit. 
(Ord. No. 07-2009, 3-3-2009) 
    Section 60.906.3. Height, area and bulk limitations for structures. 
    Unless otherwise restricted by application of regulations elsewhere in this Ordinance, the total height, area and bulk of any structure shall be limited by the conditions governing the particular development or use authorized by special use permit. However, the total height, area and bulk of any structure authorized by a special use permit shall not exceed the least restrictive regulations of the particular zoning district in which the development or use is located. 
(Ord. No. 07-2009, 3-3-2009) 
    Section 60.906.4. Lot area, lot dimensions, development limitation and yard requirements. 
    Any development or use authorized by a special use permit shall abide by the lot area, lot dimension, development limitation and yard requirements of the particular zoning district in which the development or use is located. However, these requirements may be made more restrictive in the conditions governing the particular development or use authorized by the special use permit. 
(Ord. No. 07-2009, 3-3-2009) 
    Section 60.906.5. Off-street parking and loading requirements. 
    The minimum off-street parking and loading requirements, including required setbacks for parking areas, loading spaces and internal drives for any development or use authorized by a special use permit shall not be reduced below the minimum requirements as set forth in this Ordinance. However, these requirements may be made more restrictive in the conditions governing the particular development or use authorized by a special use permit. 
(Ord. No. 07-2009, 3-3-2009) 
    Section 60.906.6. Sign regulations.

A variation may be granted by the village board of trustees upon making a finding of fact that, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary extreme and undue hardship which would deprive the owner of the property for which the variation is sought of all practical use of the property.

(a)  That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances caused by the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved or other reasons which would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience or loss of revenue, if the strict requirements of the ordinance were applied; 
(b)  That the conditions upon which the requested variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; 
(c)  That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; 
(d)  That the granting of the variation will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located and will not alter the essential character of the locality; 
(e)  That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; 
(f)  That the proposed variation complies with the spirit and intent of the restrictions imposed by this Ordinance; 
(g)  That the proposed variation does not constitute a variation in use not permitted in the district; and 
(h)  That the subject property cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the property is located.

    Section 60.907.3. Imposition of conditions and restrictions.

(c)  Length/width ratio. The length of any lot shall not be greater than three times the width of said lot, except those lots fronting on a cul-de-sac. The depth of lots fronting on a cul-de-sac should not exceed 500 feet. 
(d)  Cul-de-sac lot width. The minimum width required for a lot fronting on a circular turnaround may be measured along a line parallel to the street right-of-way line, at a distance from the street right-of-way line equal to the depth of the required front yard plus ten feet. 
(e)  Lot remnants. All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to avoid the creation of nonconforming lots. (See paragraph (a)) 
(f)  Relationship of side lot lines to street lines. All side lot lines should be at right angles to straight street right-of-way lines and radial to curved street right-of-way lines except where a deviation from this rule will result in a better street/lot design. 
(g)  Access. Land shall be subdivided in such a way that each lot abuts or has satisfactory access to a street which meets the requirements of sections 70.305 and 70.306. Land shall not be subdivided in such a way that any other parcel's sole means of access to a public road is eliminated. 
(h)  Satisfactory building sites. The design and arrangement of lots shall be such that each lot will provide a satisfactory building site, properly related to topography. 
(i)  Natural/historical features. Whenever any tract is to be subdivided, the most restrictive measures consistent with the anticipated development of the tract should be taken to protect such natural features as tree growth, wetlands, steep slopes, watercourses, etc, as well as any historically, architecturally, or archaeologically significant structures/sites. 
(j)  Lot numbering. Lots shall be numbered consecutively throughout all phases or additions of the subdivision, and the same basic subdivision name shall be given to all parts thereof. 
(k)  Flag lots. Flag lots are permitted with the special approval of the plan commission in order to permit development of backland areas while still maintaining their rural character. Requirements for flag lots are, at a minimum:

(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.305.6. - Dead-end streets. 
(a)  Temporary stub streets. Streets shall be so arranged as to provide the continuation of collector streets between adjacent properties when such continuation comports with the comprehensive plan and/or is necessary for adequate traffic circulation, effective fire and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities. If a street must dead-end temporarily because the adjacent property is undeveloped, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets shall be reserved. A temporary turnabout shall be provided at the terminus of any temporary dead-end street. 
(b)  Permanent dead-end streets. The terminus of a permanent dead-end street shall not be closer than 50 feet to the boundary of an adjacent tract.

Alleys should not intersect with one another nor change sharply in alignment. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the terminus of any dead-end alley. (See also section 70.305.1 and section 70.306.) 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.305.8. - Intersections. 
(a)  Only two streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. 
(b)  Right angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles; in no case shall two streets intersect at an angle of less than 75 degrees. An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at least 100 feet therefrom unless the subdivider's engineer recommends, and the village engineer concurs, that a lesser distance would be in accordance with safe and accepted traffic engineering practices. 
(c)  Proper alignment. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet are prohibited unless the intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either intersection. 
(d)  Rounded corners. Returns at intersections shall be made concentric and shall be rounded by a radius of not less than 25 feet at the right-of-way line. 
(e)  Flat grade. An area having not greater than three percent slope for a distance of 100 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to any intersection. 
(f)  Maximum cross-slope. The cross slope on all streets, including intersections, shall not exceed three percent. 
(g)  Adequate sight-lines.

    Where possible, a tangent at least 100 feet long should be introduced between reverse curves on land access and collector streets. (See Figure 5.) 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.305.11. - Dedication/reservation of right-of-way. 
(a)  When right-of-way must be dedicated. (This paragraph does not apply to private streets.) 
(1)  The subdivider shall dedicate at least the minimum right-of-way indicated in section 70.305.1 whenever he proposes to build any of the listed streets. 
(2)  Whenever the subdivider proposes to build any of the listed streets, he shall dedicate right-of-way in excess of the stated minimum where, in the village engineer's professional opinion: 
i.  Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate sight-lines; or 
ii.  Due to the location of streams, railroad tracks, etc. additional width is needed to construct bridges, underpasses, and/or safe approaches thereto. 
(b)  When right-of-way must be reserved. The subdivider shall receive right-of-way in the instances stated below. If the governmental entity requiring the reservation has not purchased such right-of-way or acquired it through condemnation proceedings within one year from the date the final plat is recorded, the reservation shall cease to legally bind the subdivider. 
(1)  Whenever the state, Madison County, or any township or municipality within the county has gone on record as desiring to relocate or construct any street or highway through or adjacent to any proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall reserve sufficient right-of-way in the locations prescribed by said governmental entity. 
(2)  Whenever a subdivision abuts an existing street that does not meet the standards set forth in section 70.305.1, the subdivider shall reserve sufficient right-of-way along the side of the street abutting the subdivision so that, when additional right-of-way is acquired on the other side, it will be possible to comply with said standards. 
(c)  Right-of-way not part of minimum setback. As noted in section 70.303, any land that is dedicated or reserved for public rights-of-way shall not be counted in determining compliance with the lot size and setback requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.305.12. - Private streets. 
    Hereafter it shall be unlawful to create any private street unless a subdivision variance has been granted. To obtain such a variance, the subdivider must satisfactorily demonstrate that there is virtually no current or potential public interest in the proposed private street. In every case, a variance to permit a private street shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  Private streets shall be constructed in accordance with this ordinance; 
(b)  That no additional subdivision shall be developed using such private street as a means of access to a public street; 
(c)  A private street within a residential subdivision shall not connect to more than one public street; 
(d)  That the final plat will show the location and width of such private street; and 
(e)  That the final plat will include a certificate stating essentially as follows: 
I, ___________ owner of tract ___________ and the private road or street shown hereon, declare that said private road or street is not dedicated to the public but shall remain private, to be maintained by and for the adjoining lot owners until such time that said street(s) is accepted by the Village of Godfrey, Illinois. 
Date: ___________ Signed: ___________ 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.305.13. - Designation of private streets and disclosure. 
    For any subdivision having private streets and approved after the effective date of these regulations, the subdivider must construct a sign at all entrances to the subdivision, within 50 feet of the entrance, which shall state: 
PRIVATE STREETS: 
MAINTAINED BY PROPERTY OWNERS 
These signs shall be installed where they are easily visible to anyone entering the subdivision and maintained in good order by the subdivider until the last lot is sold in the subdivision and by the property owners association thereafter. The minimum size for each sign shall be 12 inches high by 18 inches wide, with three-inch high letters. The contrast between the background and the lettering shall be sufficient to make the sign easily read. 
Disclosure: In addition to the signs, disclosure shall be made to each prospective purchaser and purchaser within the subdivision, in substantially the following form: 
THE STREETS IN THIS SUBDIVISION ARE PRIVATE AND ARE NOT MAINTAINED BY THE VILLAGE OF GODFREY. THE OWNERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE OF SAID STREETS. 
This disclosure shall be printed on all purchase contracts and the prospective purchaser shall be made aware of this provision. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.306. - Street improvements standards. 
    All streets and alleys shall be improved in accordance with the Standards of the Illinois Department of Transportation and the requirements of this section. (See Figure 6.) 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.306.1. - Subgrade. 
    The subgrade shall be prepared in accordance with IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, except as amended or expanded as follows: 
1.  Soils report: On all new or reconstructed collector and higher class village streets, it may be required that a soils report be prepared by an experienced, independent materials testing firm. The soils report should at a minimum include the following: location and design section which identifies the projects location, length, existing conditions, existing and proposed pavement typical sections, stations of borings; a soil geology section which describes existing soil types and profiles and provides a sieve analysis of each soil boring with grain size distribution plots, liquid limits, plastic limit, % sand, % clay, % silt, and subgrade support rating; copies of actual boring logs; a soil profile plot based on interpretation of boring logs; and a conclusion and recommendation section which includes recommendations for lime stabilization with recommended application rates of lime and water and any other subgrade stabilization alternatives. 
2.  Testing: The following minimum subgrade tests shall be performed according to applicable testing standards: 
a.  Compaction: The IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction shall govern subgrade compaction. Moisture density requirements should apply to all embankment construction and to the upper 12 inches of cut sections. Testing should be performed every 100 feet of roadway with tests alternating between lanes (i.e., 200-foot intervals in each lane of traffic). 
b.  Subgrade stability: The design CBR (California Bearing Ratio) for the Village of Godfrey is three percent. A CBR of three percent indicates a poor or weak subgrade strength condition. Subgrade strengths at the time of construction should be at least six percent (CBR = six percent) in the top 12 inches of the subgrade. For pavement designs that do not require a design CBR value, such as in the IDOT BDE pavement design sections, a soil support rating of "poor" should be used. Where appropriate an Illinois Bearing Ratio (IBR) of two percent shall be used for design. 
The DCP (dynamic cone penetrometer) is used to estimate the in situ CBR of granular materials and fine-grained soils. The DCP can be used to determine that the recommended subgrade CBR of six percent in the top 12 inches of subgrade is obtained during construction. The DCP used for testing shall comply with the most current ASTM standard. Testing should be performed every 50 feet of roadway with tests alternating between lanes (i.e., 100-foot intervals in each lane of traffic). 
Prepared subgrades shall be retested after the winter, when significant ponding water has been present, or when the subgrade is significantly saturated with moisture and approved by the village engineer prior to placement of any paving materials. The village engineer may require additional testing prior to paving if there are any apparent changes in the subgrade. 
c.  Proof rolling: In addition to stability and density testing, the village engineer may require that the subgrade be "proof rolled" prior to approval of the subgrade and before the placement of base materials. Trucks shall be loaded as follows: 27,000 pounds on two axles and 45,000 pounds on three axles with the tolerance not to exceed ten percent. A loaded truck shall make a single pass along each lane of street or parking subgrade at distances as directed by the village engineer and not to exceed ten feet apart. Any areas of the prepared and compacted subgrade which show rutting, cracking, or rolling upon test rolling will be marked as unsuitable and will not be accepted. The unsuitable areas shall be removed and reconstructed as directed in this chapter. Additional DCP's may be required to better define the area of deficiency. 
3.  Remediation: If subgrade compaction and stability requirements cannot be met, then, with the approval of the village engineer, the following remediation methods shall be executed: 
a.  Unsuitable material: Unsuitable material in untreated or unstabilized subgrade shall be removed to a minimum depth of 12 inches, with additional material removal as required by the village engineer. The resultant void shall be backfilled with embankment material and compacted. The use of additional stability methods, such as coarse aggregate and geofabrics, may be required by the village engineer. 
Unsuitable materials in treated or stabilized subgrades shall be removed and replaced with course aggregate. After the subgrade has been treated or stabilized, the engineer will use a DCP to test the compacted subgrade and will determine the locations of unsuitable material that will need to be removed. The contractor shall remove the unsuitable material to a minimum depth of 18 inches with additional material removal as required by the village engineer. The removed material shall be disposed of in accordance with Article 202.03 of the Standard Specifications. The resultant void will be backfilled with a minimum of 12 inches of coarse aggregate with a gradation of CA-1 and capped off with a minimum of six inches of coarse aggregate with a gradation of CA-6. The CA-6 depth should always be placed at a depth of six inches; however, the CA-1 depth may increase depending on the depth of unsuitable material removal. The coarse aggregate shall meet the requirements of Section 1004 of the Standard Specifications. Compaction of the coarse aggregate shall be performed to the satisfaction of the engineer. 
b.  Lime stabilization: Lime stabilization is recommended for remediation by the village when the soils report indicates that existing roadbed soils are lime reactive. The lime shall be mixed to a minimum depth of 12 inches and shall follow IDOT's Standard Specification for Lime Stabilized Soil Mixture. Laboratory evaluation and design procedures for lime reactive soils shall follow all procedures and guidelines outlined in the latest edition of the IDOT Geotechnical Manual. Specifically, evaluation and design procedures should follow Attachment II-B, Method A of the Geotechnical Manual. The design lime content is the amount used for construction and shall be one percent above the minimum lime content. The minimum lime content is the value which provides a compressive strength gain of 50 psi over that of the untreated soil, and provides a minimum average compressive strength of 100 psi for the treated soil. Soils that do not meet these minimum requirements will not be considered for lime stabilization. 
c.  The use of additional stability methods, such as geofabrics, may be required by the village engineer. If fully saturated conditions exist, underdrains may be required to dewater the subgrade.

(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.406. - Rural large lot single-family residential subdivision. 
    The provisions of this section are intended to recognize that certain areas within the village exist which are primarily rural in character and not proximate to more urbanized areas of the village where traditional single-family residential subdivision development has occurred and in which it may be appropriate for different subdivision standards to apply as set out in this section. 
    A rural large lot two up to five acre lot size single-family subdivision may be developed pursuant to the provisions and under the standards of this section in circumstances where the subdivider: (1) proposes to develop a subdivision in a portion of the village which is primarily rural and devoted to agricultural purposes, (2) intends to preserve and maintain a rural flavor and lifestyle by the use of lots larger two up to five acres each than those typically found in single-family residential subdivisions in more urbanized portions of the village, (3) proposes a development in a portion of the village not presently served by sanitary sewers and which is not likely to be served by sanitary sewers in the foreseeable future, and (4) will strictly limit development to single-family residential use with individual lots of not less than two acres each in size. Except as may be otherwise specifically and expressly provided under the provisions of this section, rural large lot single-family residential developments shall comply fully with ail of the general subdivision regulations of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.406.1. - Application and review by the planning and zoning commission. 
    Any subdivider desiring to come within the provisions of this section shall, at the time of preliminary plat submission, make application for consideration of the preliminary plat as a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision. The planning and zoning commission may by rule establish requirements for submittals for rural large lot single-family residential subdivision which are in addition to or different from those required for other subdivision developments for which approval is required under this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.406.2. - Standards for rural large lot single-family residential subdivisions. 
    The following standards shall apply to all subdivisions proposed for approval under the provisions of this section as a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision: 
(a)  Individual lots in any such development shall be not less than two acres and may be up to five acres each in size and shall be devoted solely to single-family residential purposes (with the exception of common areas in the development, utility, or public safety uses). The tract which is proposed for development shall be suitable for large lot single-family residential development and the construction of single-family residences on such lots. Not more than one single-family residence together with accessory structures as permitted under applicable zoning regulations shall be constructed on any lot within a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision. Any characteristics of topography, location, soil conditions or other aspects of the tract which cause it to be unsuitable for such development shall preclude development of the tract as a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision, unless the subdivider presents a suitable solution to correct the problem presented by any such characteristic of the tract. 
(b)  Developments proposed under this section shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the Village of Godfrey and the goals and purposes therein set out. The planning and zoning commission, in determining whether to approve an application under this section, shall consider not only the specific tract which is proposed for development, but also the existing land usage and the potential and probable future land usage or development in the area where the proposed development would be located. The commission shall examine the potential impact of the proposed development on the surrounding area and the interrelationship the proposed development will have with probable future development in the area. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such examination would include the impact of current or future agricultural operations on adjacent or neighboring tracts, comparable residential development on adjacent or neighboring tracts, or more intense or different existing or probable future residential or commercial development on adjacent tracts or in the surrounding area in which the proposed development is to be located. 
(c)  Such developments shall in every case comply with all applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance (including floodplain criteria) and building code of the Village of Godfrey as well as any other applicable ordinance, rule or regulation. 
(d)  Both preliminary and final plats, as well as all other standard submittals, which shall meet the requirements of Article 4, shall be submitted for each rural large lot single-family residential subdivision development. In addition, applicants shall submit any other supplementary information requested by the planning and zoning commission for purposes of reviewing the application as a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision and the applicant shall be responsible for any engineering studies or expense which may be requested by the planning and zoning commission. The commission may in appropriate circumstances modify the requirements of Article 4 for survey or engineering studies only if the commission determines that such are not necessary by reason of the application of the standards of this section as to streets, storm drainage, and sewage disposal to the proposed development. Any applicant desiring such a modification shall request same prior to or at the time the preliminary plat is filed with the commission. If description of the lots within a proposed rural large lot single-family residential subdivision by lot and block number is not practical, the planning and zoning commission may permit the use of metes and bounds descriptions, provided that this meets the requirements of any other applicable statute or ordinance. 
(e)  Lot size. The planning and zoning commission may consider a proposal to include private street easements in the calculation of lot size in a rural large lot single-family residential subdivision development. A facility or feature (such as a lake or pond) which is for the private and exclusive use of the contiguous lots may be included as a portion of a private lot and may be considered for the lot size, provided that the buildable lot area equals 75 percent of the total lot. Facilities and features, such as water reservoirs for fire protection, for the use of the entire development must be placed in common ground unless it can be demonstrated that all lots have access to the facility or feature and that the subdivision covenants adequately provide for perpetual private maintenance of the facility or feature. 
(f)  Streets and ways. Streets in any rural large lot single-family residential subdivision development which are intended by the subdivider for dedication to the public at the present or any future time shall meet all of the standards for streets set out in sections 70.305, 70.306 and 70.308. Streets which are intended to be private and remain private within a rural large lot single-family residential development shall meet the requirements of section 70.305.12, except the requirement of section 70.305.12(a) regarding construction standards, provided, however, that any such private street must, minimally, meet the standards established for private roads of the Madison County Land Use Committee adopted on August 19, 1992. The subdivider shall place in the record chain of title the certification set forth in section 70.305.12(e) relating to private streets. As a further condition for approval, the subdivider shall be required to demonstrate a realistic and practical means for the continuing maintenance of any private streets in the development by annual assessments of lot owners or an equivalent method found to be acceptable to the planning and zoning commission or the village board. The planning and zoning commission as a condition for approval may also require the subdivider to be responsible for the maintenance of private streets in the proposed subdivision for such period of time following approval as may be determined by the commission to be appropriate and may require the posting of a maintenance bond in a sufficient amount and with adequate surety to secure the maintenance of the private streets in the development until a means is in place for lot owner maintenance. The commission may also condition approval on the provision of such maintenance by the subdivider until or after a specified number of lots are sold and residences constructed on the lots in the development and the establishment of a satisfactory means to provide for continuing maintenance. Approval may also require construction of any private streets in a manner which will, subsequently, permit them to be more readily upgraded to the standards called for in section 70.306. The planning and zoning commission may determine and require in particular instances that higher standards for streets within the development should apply. This would include, but not be limited to, the use of the development's streets to access any other tract owned or developed by the subdivider or any other developer which is the equivalent of a phased development. The planning and zoning commission shall also consider the overall traffic patterns and flows in the area in which the proposed development is located and may require the provision of land within the development for future streets or ways as may be deemed appropriate to meet the future needs of the village. Such consideration shall include the interconnection of streets within the development with other streets, both public and private, in the general area where the proposed development is located. Based on such review, the planning and zoning commission may determine and require in particular instances that higher standards for streets within the development should apply. No private street in any rural large lot single-family residential subdivision shall be the subject of acceptance as a public street unless end until it is upgraded to conform to the standards of section 70.306 of this ordinance. Signage, as approved by the planning and zoning commission, shall be installed upon all private streets within the development notifying the public that such streets are privately owned and maintained and that they are not maintained by the village or any other governmental entity. 
Absent some particular need, sidewalks are not required within a rural large lot single-family residential development; however, the provision of easements for the addition of sidewalks may be required. 
(g)  Utilities and fire protection. The applicant shall provide for adequate water supplies for the development by means of a public water system or private supplies, provided plat such systems shall be adequate to provide for the needs of the entire development without adversely impacting surrounding tracts or land usages in the area where the proposed development is located. Provision shall be made for an adequate water supply for public fire protection services within the development. In the event that an adequate public water system with fire hydrants located within the development is not available or feasible, an adequate water storage system such as a lake with dry hydrant or storage tank approved by the public fire department serving the development shall be supplied by the subdivider. Easements for all present and possible future utilities including, but not limited to, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electricity, telephone, cable television, and natural gas shall be provided whether or not those services are presently available to the development. Provision shall be made, insofar as is practical, for the underground installation of such utilities within the development. 
(h)  Sanitary waste systems and facilities. Any application for approval as a rural large lot single-family residential development must include adequate provision for sanitary waste disposal and treatment as may be required to meet the standards of section 70.315 and of the village zoning and building codes and any other applicable state and/or federal requirement. Where reasonable present access to a public sewer system (which is defined, for purposes of this section as being within 1,000 feet or less from a public sewer system) is available, the development shall be served throughout by such system and sewer lines shall be installed throughout the development. Where public sewers have been approved for installation in the area where the development is located by the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, sewers shall be installed throughout the development and capped until such time as public sewers are available. In cases where public sewage systems are not available and will not be available in the foreseeable future, private sewage disposal systems must meet all standards of the building code, this ordinance, and applicable state and/or federal law. The planning and zoning commission may condition approval hereunder on the provision of such additional tests as may be appropriate to assure that any private sewage disposal system proposed for installation in the development will be wholly self-contained within the lot which the system serves and will not adversely impact any adjacent lot or land outside the development by the discharge of effluent or waste, whether or not treated, from the system. This may include a requirement for regular, periodic inspections of private sewage systems. The planning and zoning commission shall also, as part of its consideration for approval, examine the impact of the proposed development along with any other existing or potential future development or land use of adjacent tracts or the area surrounding the proposed development to insure that the proposed development will not result in an overloading or saturation of the capacity of the soils to absorb such discharge both within and outside the proposed development. 
(i)  Drainage, storm sewers, erosion and sedimentation control. A rural large lot single-family residential subdivision development shall provide adequate means for the collection of runoff and discharge of stormwater within the subdivision in a manner which complies with the other provisions of this ordinance. Although storm sewers may not be required in every instance, surface drainage methods must be adequate to prevent the discharge of excessive amounts of stormwater to any adjacent tract or the creation of erosion or sedimentation problems within or outside the development. Unless a more adequate drainage system is installed, ditches shall, minimally, be installed on both sides of all streets and shall be graded to the contour required by topography, natural drainage, and existing stormwater runoff patterns in order to provide proper drainage and prevention of erosion or sedimentation. The planning and zoning commission shall, additionally, consider the effect of stormwater runoff from the proposed development with that of other existing or future developments or land uses adjacent to or in the area of the proposed development to ascertain that no cumulative stormwater drainage problem will be created or be likely to occur as a result of the proposed development. The developer may be required to provide for future storm sewer or drainage in the development, including retention basins, as may be needed to address any drainage problems which may arise. No lot owner shall construct or allow any obstruction of any ditch, swale or other stormwater drainage system which will change or impede the flow of stormwater unless the commission has given its prior approval for such construction. 
(i)  Street lighting. Street lighting will not normally be required in a rural single-family residential development, however, the planning and zoning commission may, in appropriate circumstances, require lighting within the development as may be necessary for public safety or may require private dusk to dawn lighting systems within the development to be installed by the developer. 
(j)  Covenants. The planning and zoning commission shall require the subdivider to present and adopt an adequate set of restrictions and covenants which will govern the proposed development and provide for an organization and means within the subdivision ownership for the maintenance of streets, ways, drainage systems, common sewage disposal or treatment systems, mowing of vacant lots and similar undertakings to assure that the quality of the development is maintained and so that the development does not create a burden on the public.

ARTICLE 5. - ASSURANCES FOR THE COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

Section 70.500. - Assurances generally. 
    The village board of trustees shall not approve any final plat of subdivision and, hence, the final plat shall not be entitled to recording until, with respect to all completed improvements, all the requirements of subsection (a) below have been met and, with respect to uncompleted improvements, all the requirements of subsection (a) have been met. 
(a)  Completed improvements. 
(1)  All completed improvements have been inspected and approved by the village engineer; and

    Security to guarantee the satisfactory completion of subdivision improvements shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  Form. Security may be in the form of cash deposit, a performance bond, a letter of credit from a bank approved of and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (F.D.I.C.) (or any successor agency thereto), or an escrow or impound account in a bank approved of and insured by the F.D.I.C. All security shall be in a form satisfactory to the village attorney. The village attorney, administrator, or village board of trustees shall have the right to reject any form of security he or it believes would be inadequate (for any reason) to guarantee the completion of all uncompleted improvements. 
(b)  Amount. The aggregate amount of all security shall be equal to the total estimated cost of completing all the uncompleted improvements. The amount of a particular "item of security" (i.e., a particular cash deposit, bond, escrow account, etc.) shall equal the estimated cost of completing the improvements covered by such security.

If any improvement which is to be dedicated to the village has not been completed by the end of the two-year period, the mayor or his (her) designee, with the advice and consent of the village board of trustees, may proceed as per subsection 70.501.3. By mutual consent of the village board of trustees and the owner/developer, the above terms may be extended in one year increments. In all cases, extension of time to complete any improvements to be dedicated to the village will require a similar extension of the security for those improvements. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.501.1. - Sureties. 
    There shall be a surety for every performance bond posted as security. No person shall be eligible to act as a surety unless he has been approved by the village board of trustees. Any surety who improperly fails to perform within 90 days after written notice from the village board of trustees shall be ineligible for two years thereafter to act as surety for any subdivision improvement within the village's jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.501.2. - Release of security. 
(a)  The village clerk may release up to 90 percent of the amount of security from time to time upon written authorization from the village board of trustees.

Section 70.501.3. - Failure to complete improvements. 
    If a secured improvement has not been completed at the expiration of the term of the security (two years, or longer if extension(s) has been granted), the administrator, with the consent of the village board of trustees and the assistance of the village attorney, may: 
(a)  Require the subdivider to submit new security in an amount sufficient to cover any increase in the cost of constructing the improvement(s) in question; or 
(b)  Require the surety or financial institution to pay to the village an amount equal to the cost of completing the required improvement(s) or the amount of the security not theretofore released, whichever is less. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.502. - Subdivider's maintenance responsibilities. 
(a)  Public improvements. "Public improvements" means those improvements which are so designated on the approved improvements plans. The subdivider shall adequately maintain all public improvements until they have been dedicated to the village or other appropriate governmental entity. Following dedication, the village or other governmental entity shall assume normal maintenance duties. However, if any maintenance problem due to improper construction occurs within three years after dedication of said improvements then, in accordance with section 70.503, the subdivider's maintenance security shall be used to correct said problem unless said security has been released as provided in section 70.503. 
(b)  Private improvements. The subdivider shall maintain all improvements not designated "public" on the approved improvements plan until such time when arrangements for their perpetual maintenance are made in accordance with all applicable regulations of the Illinois Department of Health, Illinois Commerce Commission, and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 
(Ord. No. 37-99, 6-1-99) 
Section 70.503. - Maintenance security.

(a)  Form. Security may be in the form of a cash deposit, a performance bond, a letter of credit from a bank approved of and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or an escrow or impound account in a bank approved of and insured by the FDIC. All security shall be in a form satisfactory to the village attorney. The village attorney, administrator, or village board of trustees, shall have the right to reject any form of security he or it believes would be inadequate (for any reason) to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all the improvements in question for the required time period (see section 70.502).

Upon failure of the subdivider to make the requested corrections within 30 days, the village shall notify the surety or financial institution of such failure and request sufficient funds from the security to complete said corrections. 
(d)  The maintenance security shall remain in effect for not less than a two-year period after the date on which the Village of Godfrey approves the improvements as completed. The maintenance security may be released after a two-year period following the date on which the Village of Godfrey approves the improvements as completed if the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  A written request for inspection of the improvements is delivered to the Village Engineer of the Village of Godfrey not more than 90 days prior to the expiration of the two-year period after the date on which the Village of Godfrey approves the improvements as completed;

    Any subdivider desiring a variance from the requirements of these regulations shall file a written application therefor with the administrator at the same time that he files his preliminary plat.

(d)  The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of his own making; and 
(e)  The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not generally applicable to other tracts and, therefore, that a variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (see section 70.604).

(Ord. No. 04-2012, 3-6-2012) 
Section 80.004. - Sign area and dimension computations. 
(a)  Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a flush-mounted or wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof, which will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation, emblem, or other display, including any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, decorative fence, or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets any applicable zoning regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(b)  Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from anyone point. When two identical sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are a part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of only one of the faces. 
(c)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction; or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot be reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower. 
(d)  Zone lots with multifrontage. Zone lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. The total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street, however, may not exceed the portion of the zone lot's total sign area that is derived from that street frontage or building frontage. 
(Ord. No. 04-2012, 3-6-2012)

(6)  If the activity on the premises where the nonconforming sign is located is discontinued for a continuous period of less than 90 days, the nonconforming sign shall be allowed to remain; however, any defunct sign must be removed as otherwise provided in this Ordinance. For purposes of this subsection, business or activities which are seasonal in nature shall not be considered discontinuance. 
(7)  Any nonconforming sign shall be brought into compliance with this Ordinance or removed if either of the following occurs:

(b)  Review and action on application. A completed sign permit application shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator or such other official of the village as designated by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Godfrey. No application shall be deemed received for review until it is complete in all particulars and all information required has been submitted by the applicant. A submitted application shall be reviewed within 21 days of its initial submission for completeness. If it is found to be incomplete, the reviewing official shall notify the applicant of any incomplete items or deficiencies within the said 21-day period. An incomplete application is not deemed filed for purposes of review under this section. 
Within 21 days of the submission of a fully complete application for a sign permit, the reviewing officer shall either: 
(1)  Issue the sign permit, if the sign(s) that is the subject of the application conforms in every respect to the requirements of the ordinance, unless the sign is one which requires the approval of the planning and zoning commission. If the sign application requires the approval of the planning and zoning commission, the commission will consider the application at its next regular meeting following referral; provided that, the application must be referred not less than ten days, prior to a regular meeting of the planning and zoning commission for consideration at that meeting. If this time requirement is not met, this application will be considered at the next subsequent regular meeting of the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission shall issue its decision within 45 days of the first regular meeting at which it considers the application. Failure to approve within the foregoing time limit shall constitute approval of the application. 
(2)  Reject the sign application and refuse to issue a permit, if the sign(s) that is the subject of the application fails in any manner to conform to the requirements of the ordinance. In case of a rejection, the reviewing officer shall specify the reason or reasons for the rejection and will notify the applicant within the 21-day submission period or within ten days thereafter. 
By agreement of the applicant and the reviewing officer or commission, the foregoing time limits may be extended or waived. 
(c)  Construction/installation. An applicant, upon issuance of a sign permit, shall have six months from the date of issuance of the permit to construct or install the sign for which the permit has been issued. In the event the construction or installation is not substantially complete within six months from the date of its issuance, it shall automatically lapse and become void, and a new application must be submitted for the installation of the sign. 
Following completion of the construction or installation of the sign, the applicant shall notify the reviewing official to request an inspection of the installation. If the construction or installation is complete and in full compliance with the ordinance and with all applicable building and electrical codes, the reviewing officer will certify such completion and compliance on the sign permit for the sign. 
In the event construction or installation is not in compliance with the ordinance and/or other applicable codes, the reviewing officer shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and allow an additional 30 days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. In the event the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the sign permit shall automatically lapse. 
In the event the construction is complete and in compliance with the ordinance and/or other applicable codes by such compliance date, the reviewing officer shall issue the certification as described above. 
(d)  Duration. Once a sign permit is issued for a particular sign, the sign permit shall continue so long as the sign is maintained in the manner set forth in this Ordinance and all other requirements of this Ordinance are met. 
(e)  Lapse of sign permit. A sign permit shall lapse automatically if the establishment of activity on the zone lot or premises to which the sign relates is discontinued for a period of 90 days or more. 
(f)  Transferability. A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner or occupant of the property upon which the sign is located. 
(g)  Modification. Before any sign for which a permit has been issued is modified or altered in any manner, other than merely changing the message content of the sign, an application for a new sign permit shall be filed and processed as set forth in this section.

(a)  A notice directing corrective action shall be in writing and should include the following: 
(1)  A description of the premises sufficient for identification (parcel identification number, or common street address being sufficient). 
(2)  A statement indicating the nature of the violation.

The failure of the responsible person to reimburse such expenses within 30 days of the date such expenses are the subject of a billing by the village, shall give rise to and result in a lien in favor of the village with respect to such expenses against the real estate upon which the subject sign is located or to which it is related. The claim for reimbursement may be the subject of a separate action at law by the village for recovery of the amount due, and the lien may be the subject of an action of foreclosure under the applicable laws of the State of Illinois, or both of such actions may be combined with and made a part of any enforcement action under this Ordinance.
