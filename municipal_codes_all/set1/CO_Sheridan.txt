PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sheridan, Colorado. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through January 14, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, Beth L. Williams and Vicki L. Ward, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Arlene Sagee, City Clerk, James A. Windholz, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
PREFATORY SYNOPSIS 
    On November 6, 2001 the citizens of the City of Sheridan approved the formation of a nine-member Home Rule Charter Commission to draft a Home Rule Charter for the City. In conformity with Article XX of the Colorado Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1971, as amended, the Sheridan Home Rule Charter Commission has spent the last several months drafting this Charter and hereby submit it to the people. The Charter was drafted utilizing public input, extensive research into past practices, and with the advice and expertise of legal and financial professionals. 
    We believe this Charter will allow Sheridan to capitalize on its existing strengths, while allowing for a future full of promise for our City. The Commission members have sought to prepare a charter which holds the City's elected and appointed officials to the highest ethical standards. The Charter also reserves and assures the absolute rights and power of the citizens for self-government under the Home Rule provisions of the Colorado Constitution. The Charter may be amended by voter approval if the need arises, and guarantees and vests the final voice of City government in the people of Sheridan. 
    The form of government provided for in the Charter is a "Council-Manager" form, with the manager's duties and responsibilities fundamental to creating a collaborative framework in which all Sheridan residents and City employees can maintain and enhance the quality of life in our City. The elected City Council will continue as a Mayor and six-member Council with four-year overlapping terms; and no change to existing boards and commissions will take place, although the Charter gives Council the authority to make changes in the future. 
    The Commission has provided in the Charter that the City Clerk and City Treasurer be appointed and supervised by City Council rather than elected. This will allow the City to employ a full time City Clerk and City Treasurer who have necessary qualifications and skills to provide the City with expertise needed in these positions. 
    We were careful not to infringe on the citizen's rights to vote on issues such as new taxes or term limits. We believe issues of that importance should be decided separate from this Charter. 
    It was the intent of the Commission that major City policies be decided by Ordinance, requiring a public hearing prior to adoption. In addition, the democratic techniques of initiative, referendum, and recall are also included in the Charter. By these rights, all citizens have the final voice in their government. 
    The adoption of this Charter gives Sheridan all the powers available to a Home Rule city, such as local control of local issues. The Commission has structured it to meet the present and future needs of the citizens of Sheridan. 
    The Commission members wish to thank the citizens of Sheridan for entrusting them with the responsibility of composing this Charter.

(b)  No pawnbroker, employee, or agent of the pawnbroker shall enter into a contract for purchase or purchase transaction with any person known by such persons to have been convicted of any felony without first notifying the police department, or with any person whose actions would give the pawnbroker, employee or agent of the pawnbroker probable cause to believe the tangible personal property that is the subject of the contract for purchase or purchase transaction was obtained illegally. 
(c)  With respect to a contract for purchase, no pawnbroker, employee, or agent of a pawnbroker may permit any customer to become obligated on the same day in any way under more than one contract for purchase agreement with the pawnbroker which would result in the pawnbroker obtaining a greater amount of money than would be permitted if the pawnbroker and customer had entered into only one contract for purchase covering the same tangible personal property.

No sale or other imposition may be made of such property held by any pawnbroker while the hold order remains outstanding.

Sec. 22-93. - Liability of pawnbroker. 
(a)  A pawnbroker who accepts any article in a purchase or contract of purchase transaction from a customer who is not the owner thereof obtains no title in the article either by reason of the expiration of the contract or by transfer of the receipt to the pawnbroker by the customer or holder thereof. Ignorance of the fact that the article was lost or stolen shall not be construed to affect the question of the title.

The lawful owner may, upon proof of his or her ownership of the article lost or stolen, claim the same from the pawnbroker or recover the same by the appropriate legal means including, without limitation, forfeiture of the fair market value of such article out of the bond required by section 22-82.

(2)  A description of the pledge sufficient to adequately identify the pledge;

(4)  The amount, duration, and terms of the contract for purchase. 
    In addition, language which complies with the requirements of section 22-89 of this article shall appear on the back of the pawn ticket. The pawnbroker may insert on the pawn ticket any other terms, conditions, and information not inconsistent with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Transfer of pawn ticket generally-Transfer to pawnbroker. The holder of the pawn ticket shall be presumed to be the person entitled to cancel the contract for purchase and, except as provided otherwise in this article, the pawnbroker shall deliver the pledge to the person presenting the pawn ticket upon payment of principal and any applicable charges, and upon surrender of the pawn ticket. The holder of any pawn ticket may transfer same to the issuing pawnbroker by writing upon the ticket "transferred to (name of pawnbroker)" and signing same under such writing. The effect of transferring a pawn ticket to the issuing pawnbroker shall be to vest in the pawnbroker such ownership and title to the pawn ticket and the pledged property represented thereby as the holder had. Every instance of transference of a pawn ticket to a pawnbroker shall be reported within seven days to the police department as set forth in section 22-89. 
(c)  Loss of pawn ticket . If a pawn ticket is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the customer shall so notify the issuing pawnbroker in writing. Before permitting the cancellation of the contract for purchase or issuing a duplicate pawn ticket, the pawnbroker may, in addition to satisfying himself/herself of the validity of the claim, require the customer to make an affidavit of the alleged loss, destruction, or theft of the ticket. Upon receipt of such affidavit or statement in writing, as the case may be, the pawnbroker shall permit the customer to cancel the contract for purchase or the pawnbroker shall deliver to the customer a duplicate ticket, and the pawnbroker shall incur no liability for doing so unless he/she had previously received written notice of an adverse claim.

(d)  Adverse claims.

If no action is brought against the pawnbroker by either party prior to the expiration of the period for which the pawnbroker is required under section 22-89 of this article to hold the pledge, the pawnbroker may proceed to sell the pledge in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Altered pawn ticket. The alteration of a pawn ticket shall not excuse the pawnbroker who issued it from liability to deliver the pledge according to the terms of the ticket as originally issued, but shall relieve the pawnbroker from any other liability to the pledgor of the ticket.

Upon such occasion, the pawnbroker shall immediately notify the police department. The police department shall then place a hold order on the pawn ticket so seized, as set out in section 22-92, and the pledged property identified in said pawn ticket shall be held by the pawnbroker until such time as the lawful disposition of the pledged property is either agreed upon, determined by a court action, or directed by ordinance or statute, or until the hold order is either ordered released by the police department or has expired. 
(2)  If a pawnbroker has reason to believe a customer is exhibiting counterfeit or fraudulent identification, the pawnbroker or his/her employee, acting in good faith and upon probable cause based upon reasonable grounds therefor, may seize such identification without incurring civil or criminal liability as a result of such seizure, provided the pawnbroker immediately notifies and gives such identification to the police department.

Editor's note- Provisions set out herein as art. XII,  12-251-12-263, have been redesignated as such by the editor. Ord. No. 1992-17,  1, adopted September 22, 1992, enacted such provisions as art. XI,  12-221-12-233. See also the editor's footnote to art. XI. 

Sec. 22-215. - Legislative findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds that trash, garbage, refuse and other solid wastes from residences and businesses within the city have been known to contribute to the consumption of limited landfill space and that solid waste landfills may also contribute to the pollution of air, water and other precious natural resources of the state. The city council finds that the best interests of the public's overall health, safety and welfare will be served by a program for the recycling and reuse of recyclable materials contained in the garbage, trash, refuse, and other solid wastes generated by residences and businesses within the city. The city council finds that the city should support such a recycling program by encouraging economic competition and free enterprise within the city among private trash haulers willing to provide recycling services. Moreover, city council finds that residents and business operators will more readily take advantage of available recycling services if the city facilitates the free flow of information concerning such services.

    Red-light camera means a device adapted for use at a signalized intersection or crosswalk and that is programmed to produce an image which depicts a vehicle, the driver of which has violated the provisions of Steady Red Indication section 604(c) of the MTC, at the intersection or crosswalk, and which also indicates the vehicle's location before entering and within the intersection, street, stop line or crosswalk, and the date and approximate time of day and the status of the applicable traffic signal. Red-light camera also includes a device which will use sensors, camera, and other equipment to detect red-light violations and compute the speed of vehicles by recording the time the vehicle takes to activate two or more sensors set at known distances. 
(Ord. No. 10-2010,  1, 10-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-104. - Issuance of summons and complaint. 
(a)  When a peace officer, based on evidence obtained in whole or in part by means of a red-light camera, or photo-speed camera, has probable cause to believe that a vehicle has been driven in violation of Steady Red Indication section 604(c) MTC, or Speeding section 1101(1) MTC, the peace officer may issue, or cause to be issued, through a contractor designated by the city, a summons and complaint charging the designated operator of the vehicle or person in whose name the vehicle is registered based on the license plate, or any other identification of the vehicle, with violation of Steady Red Indication section 604(c) MTC, or Speeding section 1101(1) MTC. If, however, the vehicle is registered in more than one person's name, the summons and complaint shall be issued to the registrant whom the issuing peace officer determines, under all the facts and circumstances, was the person most likely depicted in the image produced by the camera. The summons and complaint shall contain the signature, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, of the peace officer issuing the summons and complaint. 
(b)  Proof that a particular vehicle was driven in violation of Steady Red Light Indication section 604(c) MTC, or was exceeding the legal speed limit in violation of Speeding section 1101(1) MTC, as detected by red-light camera or photo-speed camera, together with proof that the particular vehicle is registered in the charged person's name, shall raise the evidentiary presumption and constitute prima facie evidence in any prosecution of a violation that the charged person was the person driving the vehicle depicted. However, such evidence and presumption may be rebutted by presentation of probative and competent evidence that the charged person was not the driver shown. If the image is not of sufficient quality to permit reasonable identification of the driver of the vehicle, the presumption shall not arise. 
(c)  In the event that the person issued a notice of violation resulting from the use of a red-light camera, or photo speed camera, chooses to contest the issuance of the notice of violation by refuting that he or she was the person operating the vehicle at the time the violation was committed, he or she may sign an affidavit under penalty of perjury, to be filed with the municipal court, that he or she was not the person operating the vehicle at the time the infraction or violation was committed. 
(d)  Penalties for filing false affidavits shall apply and be enforceable in either the municipal court or any other court having jurisdiction over the offense. 
(Ord. No. 10-2010,  1, 10-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-105. - Judicial notice of automated vehicle identification systems. 
(a)  The scientific principles and techniques underlying automated vehicle identification systems are generally accepted in the scientific community and produce valid, trustworthy, and reliable results when operated in accordance with the foundation in evidence required under subsection (b) below. 
(b)  In any prosecution for violations under chapter 38 of this Code, the results of any automated vehicle identification system shall be admitted into evidence to show the speed of the motor vehicle, the location of the vehicle with respect to an intersection, street, stop line, crosswalk, or traffic signal at any particular instant, the color or condition of any traffic signal at any particular instant, the identity of the occupants of the motor vehicle, and the identity of the motor vehicle, if the following foundation is established in evidence: 
(1)  The person setting up or operating the automated vehicle identification system was qualified to do so through training or experience; and 
(2)  The automated vehicle identification system was operated in substantial compliance with the manufacturer's instructions or procedures for operation of the system. 
(c)  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit the introduction, reception, or consideration of other evidence or techniques for the measurement of the speed of a motor vehicle, the location of a motor vehicle with respect to an intersection, street, stop line, crosswalk, or traffic signal, the color or condition of the traffic signal at any particular instant, identification of the motor vehicle, identification of the occupants of a motor vehicle, or other relevant facts in any traffic case.

Sec. 38-106. - Penalties. 
(a)  The penalty for speeding less than 25 miles per hour over the applicable speed limit in violation of Speeding section 1101(1) MTC, if evidence produced by red-light camera or photo-speed camera constituted an indispensable element of the proof, shall be $40.00. The penalty for violation of Steady Red Indication section 604(c) MTC, if evidence produced by red-light camera or photo-speed camera constituted an indispensable element of the proof, shall be $75.00. The fine provisions of section 615(1) MTC concerning traffic infractions in school zones shall also apply to fines imposed under this subsection. 
(b)  In addition to other court costs, there shall be imposed upon any defendant who did not waive service of process the actual cost for service of process. 
(Ord. No. 10-2010,  1, 10-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-107. - Home rule authority. 
    Because the city council, acting pursuant to its home rule authority, has adopted by ordinance an absolute speed limit system, and not a prima facie system, with respect to any warning or any other matter purportedly required under state law for automated vehicle identification systems the reasonable and prudent speed shall be the posted speed. The city manager may cause letters concerning violations detected by automated vehicle identification systems to be sent by first class mail to the owner of the vehicle involved, informing the owner of the event, and of the steps the city may take subsequently so long as it is clear that such letters are not the formal process of the municipal court. Because nothing in this section or in C.R.S.  42-4-110.5, changes any element of the offenses of speeding or disobeying a red-light signal, no failure of compliance shall constitute grounds for dismissal of the charge, nor shall it preclude conviction if the underlying elements are proven.

(b)  The notice shall advise of the nature of the nuisance and demand elimination or discontinuance thereof within 72 hours, or such other period of time, as may be stated therein from the time of service. The notice shall also advise that if elimination or discontinuance is not accomplished within the stated time, the city may proceed to abate the same charging the expenses thereof to the person refusing to eliminate or discontinue the nuisance and/or may proceed with civil or criminal proceedings. 
(c)  Service of the notice and demand shall be a prerequisite to the commencement of civil proceedings by the city, except for situations involving emergency abatement.

(d)  When a nuisance has not been voluntarily abated within the time specified in the notice and demand to abate, the city may, pursuant to the municipal court rules of procedure, bring a civil action in the municipal court to have the nuisance declared as such by the court and for an order enjoining the nuisance or authorizing its restraint, removal, termination of abatement by the owner or the person who caused the nuisance or the person who allowed the nuisance to be caused or to continue, or by such person's authorized agent, or a code enforcement officer or any authorized city employee, or any person under contract with the city to perform such service.

(3)  Upon the date and at the time set for appearance and trial, if the respondent or property owner has filed no response and fails to appear and if the city shows that proper service was made on the respondent at least 14 days prior to the appearance date, the court may grant such orders as are requested by the city; except that, the court shall order that enforcement by the city be stayed for ten days and that a copy of the court's order be mailed to the respondent's last known address. Failure to appear on any other date set for trial shall be grounds for entering a default and judgment thereon against a nonappearing party. For good cause shown, and prior to enforcement, the court may set aside an entry of default and the judgment entered thereon. 
(4)  The judgment of the municipal court may be appealed to the county district court. 
(5)  The defendants to an action commenced under this article, and the person liable for and subject to the remedies may include any person owning or claiming any ownership or leasehold interest in the subject property, all tenants and occupants of the subject property, all managers and agents for any person claiming an ownership or leasehold interest in such property, any person committing, conducting, promoting, facilitating or aiding in the commission of a nuisance and any person necessary to carry into effect the court's orders.

(d)  Temporary abatement orders. 
(1)  The purpose of a temporary abatement order shall be to temporarily abate an alleged nuisance pending the outcome of the matter's judicial proceeding. A temporary abatement order may be issued by the court, even if the effect of such order is to change, rather than preserve, the status quo. 
(2)  At any hearing on a motion for a temporary abatement order, the city shall have the burden of proving that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a nuisance occurred in or on the subject property and, in the case of a temporary order granted without notice to the defendant, that such order is reasonably necessary to avoid immediate, irreparable loss, damage or injury. 
(e)  Permanent abatement orders. Where the existence of a nuisance is established in a civil action under this article, the court shall enter a permanent abatement order requiring the defendant to abate the nuisance and take specific steps to prevent the same and other nuisances from occurring or recurring on the property. 
(f)  Motion to vacate or modify temporary abatement orders. 
(1)  General. At any time a temporary abatement order is in effect, any defendant or any person holding any legal or equitable interest in any property governed by such an order may file a motion to vacate or modify said order. Any motion filed under this subsection shall state specifically the factual and legal grounds upon which it is based, and only those grounds may be considered at the hearing. The court shall vacate the order if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a nuisance was committed in or on the property. The court may modify the order if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that such modification will not be detrimental to the public interest and is appropriate, considering the nature and extent of the violations. 
(2)  Consolidation of hearing with other proceedings. If all parties so stipulate, the court may order the trial on the merits to be advanced and tried with the hearing on these motions. 
(g)  Noncompliance to court issued order. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to comply or refuse to abide by any of the terms and conditions of a temporary or permanent order issued by the court.

Sec. 46-28. - Remedies. 
(a)  The city and any defendant to an action under this article may, upon the court's approval, voluntarily stipulate to orders and remedies, temporary or permanent, that are in addition to those provided in this article. 
(b)  In any case in which the city prevails in a civil action initiated pursuant to this article, the city may recover its reasonable costs and expenses of declaring and abating the nuisance, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation; such costs may be assessed against the respondent and become a lien against the subject property pursuant to the procedure set forth herein in this article. 
(c)  The remedies set forth herein are cumulative. The initiation of any action or the imposition of any penalty hereunder shall not preclude the city or any city official from instituting any other proceeding to require compliance with the provisions of this article and with any administrative orders and determinations made hereunder. No provision herein shall be construed to limit or abrogate the right of any person to bring a private action to abate a private nuisance.

Such lien shall have priority over all other liens except general taxes and shall, upon the city's certification and filing with the county, be collected and paid to the city by the county treasurer in the same manner as delinquent general property taxes.

(3)  In a case in which the underlying facts include an act of domestic violence, the court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest to an ordinance violation which does not include the domestic violence designation, unless there is a good faith representation by the prosecuting attorney that the prosecutor would be unable to establish a prima facie case if the defendant were brought to trial on the original offense.

(4)  Upon the offer of proof of other acts or transactions, the trial court shall determine whether the probative value of the evidence of other acts or transactions is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury if the evidence is allowed or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. 
(5)  Upon admitting evidence of other acts or transactions into evidence pursuant to this section and again in the general charge to the jury, the trial court shall direct the jury as to the limited purpose for which the evidence is admitted and for which the jury may consider it.

The court shall notify the alleged victim of the order if such person is not present at the time the restraining order is issued. 
(4)  The defendant, victim, or the prosecuting attorney may request a hearing before the court to modify the terms of a restraining order or to add terms to the restraining order issued pursuant to this section.

At the hearing, the court shall review the terms of the restraining order and any further orders entered and shall consider the modification(s) and/or proposed addition(s) requested by the defendant, victim, or prosecuting attorney.

Notice of an amended restraining order shall be made to the defendant in open court on the record. The victim shall be provided with a copy of the amended restraining order.

If the court orders a hold pending arraignment, however, the defendant shall be arraigned for the alleged offense on the next judicial day. For purposes of deciding the propriety of a hold pending arraignment, the court should consider, among other evidence, the following: 
(1)  The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the victim in the offense charged; 
(2)  The defendant's history of domestic violence against the victim or another family or household member or of violence against any person; 
(3)  Any records of any law enforcement agency regarding past contacts with the defendant, the victim, or another family or household member concerning domestic violence committed by the defendant; and 
(4)  Whether the information presented to the court, taken as a whole, indicates a pattern of escalation, either in frequency or severity, in domestic violence acts by the defendant. 
(h)  Appearance by the victim. Whenever a defendant receives a summons and complaint for a domestic violence violation, a police officer may serve the victim with a subpoena to appear at the same time and date scheduled for the defendant's arraignment. Such subpoena to appear shall be issued by the clerk of the municipal court and the officer who serves the subpoena shall complete the return of service and deliver it to the court. If the victim appears and the matter is not resolved by pretrial conference following the defendant's arraignment, the court may order the victim to appear at the date and time scheduled for the defendant's trial and the victim shall receive a copy of a notice to appear. The court shall exercise its contempt and equity powers to compel the appearance of victims which have been subpoenaed or otherwise ordered to appear.

    Reservation of sites for schools, fire stations, pump stations and similar public uses, upon recommendation from the public agency therein involved, and approved by the city, shall be delineated on the final subdivision plat and reserved for public purchase. Said reservation shall be an irrevocable option to purchase for one year, with a right in the public agency to extend it on an annual basis for two additional years. Each extension shall be granted by the subdivider after receiving notice of such election from the public agency involved at least 15 days prior to the date of expiration. If the option is not so extended, the site so reserved will be free and clear of any and all claim of said public agency. During the reservation period: 
(1)  The public agency shall pay to the subdivider the amount of the taxes assessed against the reserved area on an annual basis. 
(2)  The public agency shall pay to the subdivider at the time of renewal of each one year's irrevocable option, five percent of the fair market value. The fair market value shall be based upon the land value of the reserved area as developed and improved immediately before final plat approval, and shall be agreed upon, if possible, by the subdivider and the public agency concerned prior to final subdivision plat approval. If the parties are unable to agree, they shall select a mutually acceptable appraiser who shall determine such value. If the parties fail to agree upon an appraiser, court action instituted within 90 days after plat approval shall determine the fair market value upon such terms as the court shall decree. 
    Refusal to reserve a designated area shall be grounds for denying approval of the plat; however, failure to arrive at a mutually agreed value for the reserved area shall not be grounds for denying approval of the plat.

(2)  It shall not be more than ten percent average slope. 
(3)  Wetlands, land within a floodway and/or drainage detention areas will not count toward the required acreage, unless otherwise acceptable to city council. 
(4)  The dedicated land must be consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Not withstanding the requirements set forth in this section, undisturbed natural open space areas may be acceptable for a portion of the dedication requirement as publicly owned open space. The following criteria apply: 
(1)  Open space areas will be applied at the ratio of four acres of open space for each one acre of active parkland dedication credit received. 
(2)  The maximum credit will equal 25 percent of the dedication requirement. 
(3)  The open space area must consist of ten or more contiguous acres, and should not include any disturbed lands, improved channelized drainage ways, or detention or retention ponds. 
(c)  The ownership and maintenance of all park(s), open space and any other undeveloped land within a development will be specified in the final plat, or development agreement as appropriate. 
(d)  Except as required in the development agreement, or outlined below, park areas to be dedicated to the city shall be graded by the developer to their design rough grade as a part of any overlot grading of the subdivision. Additionally, vegetative cover shall be provided to ensure stabilization and prevent erosion until finish grading and park development occurs. These requirements may be waived by the city manager to accommodate timing of park improvements, or modified through agreements with the developer and city, acting through the city manager. In the event of an agreement with the city to accept the park without grading, the land to be dedicated to the city shall be preserved and protected during the development process. The developer shall not disturb the topsoil or vegetation on the land during the development process unless approved in advance by the city. If the topsoil or vegetation is damaged or disturbed, the city may require the developer to pay to the city the cost of restoring such vegetation and topsoil. 
(e)  If there is a land dedication requirement for a school site development that dedication may fulfill up to 25 percent of the city's park dedication requirements when the school site to be dedicated is contiguous to the parkland, and if an intergovernmental agreement between the city and the school district, assuring public access satisfactory to city council is executed.

(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-25. - Exemptions. 
(a)  Purpose . In certain circumstances, the application of generally applicable provisions of Chapters 18, 55 and 56 of this Code to a particular property or land use has the potential to inadvertently violate rights granted to a landowner under the United States Constitution, the Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.  2000cc, et seq. ("RLUIPA"), 42 U.S.C. 1983, and other federal statutes existing now or hereafter enacted ("federal rights"). Under the current jurisprudence regarding federal rights, courts often apply an ad hoc, case-by-case analysis to determine whether an action by a local government violates a particular federal right. The inherent uncertainty of such an approach by the courts subjects the city to potential liability arising from the inadvertent violation of a landowner's federal right, and to the costs of litigation, which include attorneys' fees and loss of time by city personnel who must devote attention to the lawsuit as opposed to their usual tasks. Even when the city is successful in defending a lawsuit, the costs of litigation are a substantial burden upon the financial resources of the city and its personnel resources. A process in which a property holder who believes that application of a provision of Chapters 18, 55 and 56 to his or her property or land use violates a federal right may apply to city council for, and receive an exemption from, any such provision that is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(b)  Definitions . As used in this subsection, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Federal right means any right granted to a property holder under the United States Constitution or any federal statute, whether currently existing or hereafter enacted, including, without limitation, the Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.  2000cc, et seq. ("RLUIPA"), and 42 U.S.C. 1983. 
(2)  Property holder means any person, persons or entity owning or holding an ownership or possessory interest in real property within the city. 
(c)  Applications . Any property holder within the city who believes that the application of one or more provisions of Chapters 18, 55 and 56 of this Code as applied to the property holder's property interest or current or proposed land use will violate one or more of the property holder's federal rights may apply for an exemption from the provision or provisions in question by submitting an application for an exemption on a form provided by the city, together with a typed list of the owners of record for any property located within 300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the exemption is requested. The application shall identify the property and/or land use for which the exemption is sought, the provisions of the Code from which an exemption is sought, the federal right at issue, and a brief explanation of why the applicant believes that application of such provisions would violate the property holder's federal right. If the application contains a request for an exemption from any provision of Chapter 18, the zoning administrator, before scheduling a public hearing on the application, may require the applicant to submit such engineering plans, studies or inspection reports as may be reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the standards set forth in subsection (f)(7) of this section. A property holder may seek an exemption that operates in a prospective manner, a retroactive manner, or both. 
(d)  Stay of enforcement . An application for a retroactive exemption from a provision of the Code of which the property holder is currently in violation may be accompanied by a requested stay of enforcement of any provisions that have been violated until such time as city council has the opportunity to act upon the application. The city manager, after consultation with the city attorney, shall grant such a stay upon a determination that the requested stay does not pose an imminent danger to the health and safety of persons or an imminent danger of damage to property and the asserted violation of a federal right is not frivolous, groundless or interposed solely for the purpose of delay. 
(e)  Procedure . After receipt of an application, the city shall notify by first class mail the owners of property located within 300 feet of the exterior property lines of the property to which the proposed exemption would apply that an application for exemption has been filed and that they may review the application during the city's regular hours. This notice will contain the date, time and location of the city council hearing, and will be mailed at least 12 days prior to the hearing. If an application requests an exemption from any provision of Chapter 18, the application shall be forwarded to the building official for review. 
(f)  Standards for exemptions . In considering whether to grant an exemption, city council shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The nature of the asserted federal right; 
(2)  The degree of uncertainty existing in the case law construing the asserted federal right; 
(3)  Any unusual factors concerning the applicant or the property for which the exemption is sought which increase the risk that the application of a generally applicable provision of the Code might inadvertently violate a federal right in the particular circumstances presented by the application; 
(4)  The governmental purpose and interest served by the provisions of the Code from which an exemption is sought, and whether such purpose and interest could be accomplished in any other manner; 
(5)  Whether granting the requested exemption would create a hardship on others; 
(6)  The potential cost of litigation over the asserted federal right; 
(7)  Other demands upon the financial resources and personnel of the city; and 
(8)  Whether any conditions should be imposed in connection with an exemption to protect the health, safety and welfare of he community. 
(g)  Exemptions from Chapter 18. No exemption from a provision of Chapter 18 shall be granted unless the building official has determined, based upon a review of the engineering plans, studies and inspection reports submitted with the application, that the exemption will not threaten the structural integrity of any building or create a risk to the health and safety of the occupants of the building. 
(h)  Exemptions from Chapter 56 use provisions . No exemption from a provision of Chapter 56 shall be granted which would authorize a use that is neither a use permitted by right, an accessory use nor a use which could be permitted subject to approval of a conditional use permit in the zone district in which the property for which the exemption is requested is located. Any exemption granted for a use that could be permitted subject to approval of a special use permit shall have the same force and effect as a special use permit for the property and shall exempt the property from the requirements of conditional use permits granted pursuant to this chapter. 
(i)  Exemptions from certain provisions of Chapter 56 provisions . Any exemption granted under this section from any lot, block, setback, parking, sign area or height, or building area or height requirements of Chapter 56 shall have the same force and effect as a variance granted pursuant to Chapter 56, Article III (Appeals and Variances) of the Code and shall exempt the property from the requirements of Chapter 56, Article III of the Code. 
(j)  Hearing . City council shall hold a public hearing upon an application for an exemption pursuant to this section. Notice of such public hearing shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 12 days prior to the hearing. In addition, the site in question shall be continuously posted with a sign for a period beginning not less than 12 days prior to the date of the hearing, said posting to be performed by the city. The sign and posting shall be in conformity with the posting utilized in zoning amendment public hearings. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, city council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the requested exemption. 
(k)  Invalidity of federal right . One of the purposes of this section is to protect the city from cost, burden and risk of litigation over federal rights. Therefore, city council shall not be required to determine whether the applicant would ultimately prevail in any assertion of the federal right in a judicial proceeding in order to grant an exemption under this section, but city council shall not grant an exemption if the asserted federal right is substantially frivolous or groundless at the time the application is made. In making its decision with respect to whether the asserted federal right is substantially frivolous or groundless, city council may rely upon advice from the city attorney or may require the applicant to provide a legal opinion from an attorney admitted to practice law in the State of Colorado. The validity of any exemption granted shall not depend upon whether the applicant would ultimately prevail in any assertion of the federal right in a judicial proceeding. No exemption granted hereunder shall be rendered invalid due to the subsequent amendment or repeal of the constitutional or statutory provision giving rise to the asserted federal right, or by any subsequent judicial decision which had it been decided prior to the time of the hearing might have affected the evaluation of the federal right in question. 
(l)  Judicial review . In order to assure a plain, simple and prompt judicial remedy to persons or parties adversely affected or aggrieved by a city action under this section, the provisions of Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to judicial review of any action hereunder. 
(m)  Retroactive application . This section shall apply both prospectively and retroactively, and any property holder may apply for an exemption from provisions of the Code with respect to any past violation. No exemption granted hereunder shall be effective to relieve the property holder of any obligation of contract or to impair any vested right held by another person or entity.

ARTICLE XVI. - PUD-PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Sec. 56-351. - Intent. 
    The PUD district permits the planning and development of land which is suitable in location and character for the uses proposed as unified and integrated developments in accordance with detailed development plans. The PUD district also provides for specific land uses not permitted in other zone districts. The PUD district is intended to provide a means of accomplishing the following objectives: 
(a)  To provide for development concepts not otherwise permitted within standard zone districts; 
(b)  To provide flexibility, unity and diversity in land planning and development, resulting in convenient and harmonious groupings of uses, structures and common facilities; varied type design and layout of housing and other buildings; and appropriate relationships of open spaces to intended uses and structures; 
(c)  To provide for the public health, safety, integrity and general welfare, and otherwise achieve the purposes as provided for within the Planned Unit Development Act of 1972, Title 24, Article 67, Colorado Revised Statutes 1973, as amended; 
(d)  To provide for phased development, the more efficient use of land and the public and private services needed therefor, and reflect changes in the technology of land development; 
(e)  To provide for the necessary land development flexibility in dwelling type, bulk, density, intensity and open space, as a policy which Sheridan wishes to encourage; and, as a corollary, regulate certain proposed land development which would distort the objective of Sheridan's zoning; and 
(f)  To encourage integrated planning in order to achieve the above purposes. 
    The provisions of the Sheridan Municipal Code pertaining to the planned unit developments and the PUD district, including this article, are intended to supersede the provisions of the Colorado Planned Unit Development Act of 1972. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-352. - Permitted uses. 
    Uses within a PUD development may be multiple in nature and may include uses not otherwise permitted within the same zone district. The location and relationship of these uses shall be as established in and conform to the policies and standards contained within the comprehensive plan and other appropriate adopted and approved plans, including but not limited to locational criteria within that comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-353. - Land uses permitted only in the PUD district. 
    The following land uses are permitted only in the PUD district: 
(a)  Mining-mineral resource extraction; 
(b)  Electric and natural gas substations; 
(c)  Correctional facilities; 
(d)  Detoxification facilities; 
(e)  Landfills; and 
(f)  Waste transfer station. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-354. - Underlying zone district regulations. 
    The official development plan shall designate an existing underlying zone district that shall govern when regulations governing density, height, setbacks, primary, secondary and accessory uses, parking, fences, walls and obstructions to view, open space, signage, and site elements are not specifically addressed in the stipulations of the approved official development plan. When appropriate, the city manager may require the applicant to develop standards, prior to site plan submittal, which are in keeping with the intent of the PUD district. Such standards must be recorded as an amendment to the official development plan. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-355. - Signage modification. 
    Except as provided herein, signage standards in any PUD district shall not be less restrictive than the standards of this chapter. Upon a finding of unique circumstances related to preexisting signs, topography, visibility, or size or shape of a property, city council may approve alternative signage standards, if such standards will not cause substantial detriment to public good, alter the essential character of the neighborhood, or not substantially impair the intent and purpose of this chapter or the comprehensive plan of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-356. - Procedure for PUD zoning and official development plans. 
(a)  In addition to the submittal and format requirements of this article, applications for PUD zoning shall comply with the application and hearing procedures for general rezonings contained in Chapter 56. The application to establish PUD zoning must include written consent from all the real property owners within the boundaries of the property that is the subject of the application. For applications to establish a PUD zoning, the planning commission and city council shall each hold a public hearing on the rezoning request, including approval of the official development plan. The planning commission shall make recommendations to city council on the application. The city council may approve the requested PUD rezoning and the official development plan in a single ordinance. 
(b)  Within existing PUD zone districts, an application for approval of a new or amended official development plan for all or a portion of the property encompassed within an existing official development plan shall comply with the submittal and format requirements of this article and the application and hearing procedures for general rezonings contained in Chapter 56, except that the application to amend or replace an official development plan need only include written consent from all the real property owners within the boundaries of the property that is the subject of the new application. City council's action regarding an application for a new or amended official development plan shall be by ordinance, following a recommendation from the planning commission. 
(c)  Approval of the official development plan establishes zoning and development criteria. Development of properties zoned as a PUD cannot commence until a site plan has been approved by the city in accordance with site development plan requirements as otherwise established in the Sheridan City Code.

Moreover, if the city must use the bond pursuant to this subsection, and if the purchaser of such bond remains in business after the use of the bond by the city, such operator must acquire and present to the city another bond which satisfies the terms of this subsection within three business days. All bonds must be reviewed and approved by the city attorney before the operator may receive a permit pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Permit approval. 
(1)  An applicant for a permit under this section shall submit two copies of its Colorado Department of Health application, the supplemental information required by subsection (c)(2) of this section, and the application fee, to the building official for the city. The building official shall forward one copy of the application to the chief of the city's fire department. 
(2)  The building official and the fire chief shall each initially review such application and either or both may request such additional information from the applicant as either or both the building official or fire chief reasonably deem appropriate. After the applicant has satisfied the building official's and the fire chief's requests for additional information, if any, and paid the application fee, the building official and fire chief shall jointly forward the copies of such application and the supplemental information to the planning commission with their respective recommendations. 
(3)  The planning commission shall schedule such application for a public hearing and publish a public notice of such hearing at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The applicant shall also post the property at the applicant's expense, according to current city zoning ordinance standards, at least 15 days prior to the public hearing as directed by the building official. The posted sign shall contain the property's legal description, its proposed use, and the date, time and place of the public hearing. 
a.  Any person shall be allowed to review any application which is the subject of pending approval hearing by scheduling an appointment with the building official during the regular business hours of the city. 
b.  After such review, any person may order a photocopy of the application from the building official by making a $20.00 deposit for photocopying expenses. The building official shall prepare the photocopy of the application and have such ordered copy available within three business days. The person ordering such photocopies shall pay the balance of the photocopying costs upon delivery of the copy by the building official. 
(4)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the noticed date and determine if any community opposition or approval exists for the proposed waste transfer station and to elicit any public input on items which may have been overlooked in the application which could have an adverse impact on the public. The planning commission may request that the applicant submit additional information or continue such public hearing so that the commission may more fully evaluate the application. 
(5)  Within 30 calendar days following its final public hearing, the planning commission shall forward the application to city council, along with its recommendations. The planning commission may recommend the application for approval, approval only with additional restrictions or conditions, or denial. If the planning commission recommends approval with conditions or denial of the application, the planning commission shall also submit to council a written report stating the reasons for its recommended conditions or restrictions, or the reasons for its recommended denial. 
(6)  Within 30 calendar days following the receipt by council of the planning commission's recommendations, city council shall take action approving or disapproving the waste transfer station, or scheduling the matter for additional public hearings if questions still exist. Council may adopt the recommendation of the planning commission, or may reject the recommendation of the planning commission. Moreover, council may approve the waste transfer station with or without conditions or restrictions reasonably calculated to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the public in addition to those recommended by the planning commission. 
(7)  The building official shall forward to the applicant the final action of council within five business days. 
(e)  Permit renewal. 
(1)  After a person has received a permit to operate a waste transfer station within the city, such permit shall be valid for not more than 12 months. Such permit must be renewed on or before January 31st of the next year following the year in which the preceding permit was issued. The application for renewal may adopt the original permit application by reference and shall supplement such original application with any new or changed information regarding the personnel or operations of the facility. 
(2)  The applicant shall submit a renewal application to the building official along with the applicable renewal fee. The building official shall forward the renewal application to city council which may renew the permit by resolution if the renewal application indicates that the waste transfer station has not changed materially either in operation or personnel such that no new or additional risks to the health, safety or general welfare of the public appear to exist. 
(3)  If the building official has reason to believe that the operator has violated the conditions of its previous permit, has otherwise violated the law in its operation of the waste transfer station, or has falsely or fraudulently submitted any information to any city department, agency, commission or board, the building official may recommend to city council that it refuse to renew the permit and that the city council issue a notice to show cause pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Under such circumstances, the city council shall consider the renewal application as a permit revocation or suspension matter pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. 
(f)  Permit suspension or revocation. 
(1)  If the building official has reason to believe that the operator has violated the conditions of its permit, has otherwise violated the law in its operation of the waste transfer station, has allowed nuisance conditions to develop or exist at the site, or has falsely or fraudulently submitted any information to any city department, agency, commission or board, the building official may ask the city council to issue a notice to show cause to the operator of the waste transfer station. 
(2)  Upon recommendation of the building official, or upon its own motion, the city council may issue a notice to show cause to the operator. The notice to show cause shall inform the operator that the city council has scheduled a public hearing concerning the operator's permit and at such hearing the operator may appear and show cause why such permit should not be suspended or revoked. The notice to show cause shall briefly state the grounds alleged for suspending or revoking the operator's permit, and the date, time and location of the public hearing. The notice to show cause shall be published and posted pursuant to subsection (d)(3). 
(3)  At the public hearing to show cause, the city may present evidence to support the allegations of the show cause notice. The operator may represent himself or may be represented by legal counsel at the show cause hearing. The operator may cross examine any witness presented by the city and may present evidence to rebut the allegations made by the building official. The city may cross examine the witnesses presented by the operator. The mayor, or his designee, shall serve as the hearing officer at such public hearing and shall rule on all evidentiary mattes. The hearing officer shall endeavor to employ procedures which fairly allow both the city and the operator to present their respective cases, but shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded electronically or by a certified shorthand reporter. 
(4)  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may go into executive session to deliberate on the evidence presented. Within 30 days following the conclusion of the public hearing, city council shall make its written findings and order. The city council may revoke the operator's permit, suspend the operator's permit, or impose additional conditions on the operator's permit. In the event that council decides to suspend or revoke the operator's permit, the operator shall immediately implement the alternative operations plan for processing the waste stream and/or for closure of the facility pursuant to the application for approval by the Colorado Department of Health. 
(g)  Permit fees. 
(1)  The building official shall not take any action on any original application for a permit until the applicant has paid an application fee in the amount of $5,000.00 to defray the city's expenses in considering and processing such application, and in inspecting and enforcing operators' compliance with such permits. 
(2)  The building official shall not take any action on any application for the renewal of a permit until the applicant has paid a renewal fee in the amount of $1,000.00 to defray the city's expenses in considering and processing such application, and in the ongoing inspection and enforcement of operators' compliance with such permits. 
(3)  Application and renewal fees shall not be refunded to applicants in the event the applicant's application for a permit is denied, not renewed, revoked or suspended. 
(h)  Restrictions on accessory uses. In addition to the application requirements and permit conditions, with which the operators of waste transfer stations must comply, operators must also satisfy the requirements of this subsection. 
(1)  Scavenging. Scavenging shall be prohibited at waste transfer stations and operators shall post "No Trespassing" signs in conspicuous places at the site as directed or approved by the city to discourage scavenging; operators shall take reasonable security measures to prevent scavenging, including the installation of fencing and adequate locks where appropriate; and operators shall undertake such other reasonable security measure as required by the city. 
(2)  Parking. Unclean transfer vehicles containing putrescible material shall not be parked on public streets or roadways; transfer or other facility vehicles shall be parked in adequate off-street and on-site parking spaces; unclean and other facility vehicles shall be parked separately from parking areas used by, or accessible to, the general public; vehicles shall be washed or cleaned at a commercial truck wash facility and shall not be cleaned or washed on-site. 
(3)  Waste handling. Receptacles containing infectious wastes shall be clearly labeled with the biohazard symbol or with the words "Infectious Waste" printed in letters of no less than one inch in height; infectious wastes must be stored, packaged, contained and transported in a manner that prevent the spilling, leaking or release of any waste material; treated infectious wastes that are no longer infectious may be mixed with other noninfectious wastes for transportation; contaminated sharps shall be placed in puncture-resistant containers; all other permitted wastes and potentially hazardous materials shall be appropriately labeled pursuant to state or federal regulations.

Secs. 56-364-56-380. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XVII. - F-FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 56-381. - Floodplain overlay district findings, boundaries, intent. 
(a)  Findings . 
(1)  The Legislature of the State of Colorado has in C.R.S.  31-15-103, as amended, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
(2)  The city council finds that there are, within the city, flood hazard areas which are subject to periodic inundation resulting in potential loss of life and property, danger to health and safety, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(3)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and some of which, when inadequately anchored, cause damage to uses in other areas. Flood losses are also caused by uses that are inadequately floodproofed, inadequately elevated or otherwise not protected from flood damage. 
(b)  Boundaries . 
(1)  This district shall encompass the one-hundred-year floodplain, as it graphically appears or is noted on the duly adopted floodplain map. 
(2)  The floodplain district shall overlay that portion of any other district, including any planned unit development district, located in the floodplain. The regulations of this district shall be construed as being supplementary to the regulations imposed on the same lands by any underlying district. When regulations of this district conflict with any provisions of the underlying district, the provisions of this district shall control. Any underlying district shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions do not conflict with the provisions of this district. 
(c)  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to reduce the flood hazards described above. To accomplish its purposes, this floodplain overlay district includes provisions for: 
(1)  Reducing the hazards of flood to life and property by: 
a.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to life or property in time of flood; 
b.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which would be hazardous to the public health in time of flood; 
c.  Restricting uses which are particularly susceptible to flood damage; 
d.  Requiring permitted floodplain uses, including public facilities which serve such uses, to be protected against floods by providing floodproofing and general flood protection at the time of initial construction; 
e.  Minimizing the need for, and expense of, rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding; 
f.  Minimizing prolonged business interruptions as a result of flooding; 
g.  Minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
h.  Helping maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
i.  Ensuring that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
j.  Ensuring that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions; and 
k.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(2)  Protecting floodplain occupants from floods caused by their own, or other, land uses which were or may have been undertaken without full realization of the danger, by: 
a.  Regulating the manner in which structures designed for human occupancy may be constructed so as to prevent danger to human life within such structures; 
b.  Regulating the method of construction of water supply and sanitation systems so as to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; and 
c.  Delineating and describing areas that could be inundated by floods so as to protect individuals from purchasing floodplain lands for purposes which are not in fact suitable. 
(3)  Protecting the public from the burden of extraordinary financial expenditures for flood control and relief, by regulating all uses within the floodplain overlay district so as to produce a method of construction and a pattern of development which will minimize the probability of damage to property and loss of life or injury to the inhabitants of the flood hazard areas. 
(4)  Protecting the storage capacity of floodplains and to assure retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows which can reasonably be expected to occur by: 
a.  Regulating the filling, dumping, dredging or altering of channels through deepening, widening or relocating; 
b.  Prohibiting unnecessary encroachments; and 
c.  Encouraging uses such as open space, parks, recreation and parking. 
(5)  Protecting the hydraulic characteristics of small watercourses, including gulches, sloughs and artificial water channels, which make up a portion of the urban major drainage system, and are used for conveying floodwaters by: 
a.  Regulating filling, dumping and channelization so as to maintain natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics of watercourses; and 
b.  Prohibiting encroachment into the watercourses. 
(Ord. No. 1-2009,  1, 3-25-2009) 
Sec. 56-382. - General provisions. 
(a)  The jurisdiction of this section includes all lands adjacent to any water course within the city that would be inundated by the one-hundred-year flood as defined by this floodplain overlay district. 
(b)  The provisions of this section shall be interpreted to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers of the city granted by Colorado law. 
(c)  The degree of flood protection required by this floodplain overlay district is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the floodplain overlay district boundaries, or land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(d)  Boundary map. 
(1)  This floodplain overlay district shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city and areas removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a Federal Emergency Management Associations (FEMA) Letter of Map Revision Based On Fill (LOMR-F). 
(2)  No structure or land within the area of special flood hazard shall hereafter be constructed, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this floodplain overlay district and other applicable regulations. 
(3)  The floodplain overlay district is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where there is a conflict or overlap between this floodplain overlay district and other zoning district, easement, covenant, or deed restrictions, however, the district with the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

    Regulatory flood protection elevation means the elevation equal to the base flood plus one foot. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Impacts may be reduced by protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this floodplain overlay district or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings; the installation of piles; the construction of columns; or any work beyond the state of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.

    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirement of this floodplain overlay district which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this district. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of required compliance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a natural or artificial channel of perceptible length and with a definite bed and banks which confines and conducts continuously or intermittently flowing water.

(2)  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in section 56-387 of this chapter; and 
(3)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(c)  The zoning administrator shall review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, the zoning administrator shall assure that the proposed development satisfies the encroachment provisions of this article. Approval or denial of a development permit by the zoning administrator shall, in addition to the requirements of this article, be based upon the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to the flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(8)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(9)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(d)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in the application for a development permit the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, as criteria for administering and implementing this floodplain overlay district for new construction, substantial improvements or other development in zone A, as identified on the flood insurance rate map. 
(e)  The zoning administrator shall: 
(1)  Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures. 
(2)  For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures: 
a.  Verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level to which the structure has been floodproofed; and 
b.  Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in this article.

(Ord. No. 5-2013,  6, 10-23-2013) 
Sec. 56-389.2. - Standards for critical facilities. 
    A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the city at any time before, during and after a flood. 
(1)  Classification of critical facilities. It is the responsibility of the city council to identify and confirm that specific structures in their city meet the following criteria: 
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (a) essential services; (b) hazardous materials; (c) at-risk populations; and (d) vital to restoring normal services. 
a.  Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and transportation lifelines. 
These facilities consist of: 
1.  Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage, and, emergency operation centers); 
2.  Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions); 
3.  Designated emergency shelters; 
4.  Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits); 
5.  Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service lines); and 
6.  Air transportation lifelines (airports (municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure (aviation control towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars). 
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances. 
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the city council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. 
These facilities may include: 
1.  Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing); 
2.  Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials; 
3.  Refineries; 
4.  Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and 
5.  Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers. 
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a material safety data sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, and the chemical(s) is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the threshold planning quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the 356 chemicals listed under 40 C.F.R.  302 (2010), also known as extremely hazardous substances (EHS); or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 C.F.R.  1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 C.F.R.  302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 C.F.R.  1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation of this section, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations Specific exemptions to this category include: 
1.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
2.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
3.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this article. 
c.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. 
These facilities consist of: 
1.  Elder care (nursing homes); 
2.  Congregate care serving 12 or more individuals (day care and assisted living); 
3.  Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving 12 or more children); 
d.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. 
These facilities consist of: 
1.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, city administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
2.  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only). 
These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the city council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this section, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the city council on an as-needed basis upon request. 
(2)  Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the special flood hazard area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this section, protection shall include one of the following: 
a.  Location outside the special flood hazard area; or 
b.  Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two feet above the base flood elevation. 
(3)  Ingress and egress for new critical facilities . New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the city council, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event.

    The purpose of this sign ordinance is to: 
(a)  Protect the public from signs which are structurally unsafe; 
(b)  Promote traffic safety and the free movement of traffic, and protect the public from the hazardous conditions which result from signs that obscure or restrict the vision of motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians; 
(c)  Facilitate easy, safe and pleasant communication between people and their surroundings; 
(d)  Conserve the character and economic value of buildings and neighborhoods; 
(e)  Provide a balance between legitimate identification and advertising needs and the visual discord which signs sometimes cause, and to provide a sense of balance or proportion between a sign and the building or property which it serves; 
(f)  Encourage the erection of signs which are legible in their surroundings, compatible with the visual character of the surrounding area, appropriate to the activities identified, and expressive of both the architecture of the building which the sign serves and the individuality of the owner of the building; and 
(g)  Minimize obstructions which impair or impede the view of the Rocky Mountains from within the city, as the absence of such obstructions will make the city a more desirable location in which to live, work, and visit.

Sec. 56-489. - Comprehensive sign plans. 
    The planning commission may permit the utilization of comprehensive sign plans for multiple building complexes which are located on one tract or parcel of real estate or two or more contiguous parcels, which are held in unified control and which comprise one or more acres, subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Submittal requirements. Applicants must submit a detailed sign plan with attached written stipulations to the planning commission for review and approval. Such stipulations shall consider all appropriate concerns including, but not limited to, the following items: location, size, height, color, lighting, orientation, construction materials, and criteria for determining the degree of variation that is to be considered "substantial." 
(b)  No minimum or maximum standards are established for the comprehensive sign plans, but each plan must contain such limitations within the plan stipulations. The sign plan shall be reviewed in terms of its impact on surrounding land uses and its compatibility with the purposes of this sign ordinance and with other city planning and zoning programs. The planning commission shall not approve a sign plan that contains off-premises signs or billboards. 
(c)  All owners of real properties affected by provisions of the comprehensive sign plans must be signatories to such plans; provided, however, that if the multiple building complex or any part thereof, is governed by a management agreement, the duly constituted representative of the management association or firm may be authorized by the owner as a signatory to such plans. It is unnecessary for owners or lessees to sign if said representative has signed on their behalf. 
(d)  Once authorized by the planning commission, a comprehensive sign plan may be modified through the following procedure: 
(1)  The zoning administrator is authorized to determine whether a modification of, or a release from, a provision of the sign plan would constitute a substantial variation from the plan originally approved by the planning commission. 
(2)  If the zoning administrator determines that the modification or release is not substantial, the zoning administrator may grant such a modification. A written summary of such determination shall be placed in the file for the comprehensive sign plan. 
(3)  If the zoning administrator determines that the requested change is substantial, the proposed change and all relevant material shall be submitted to the planning commission. 
(4)  A modification to the approved sign plan may be approved only if the following criteria are met: 
a.  The proposed change will not adversely affect the development and preservation of the entire sign plan; 
b.  The change will not adversely affect surrounding land uses; 
c.  The change will not conflict with the purposes of this sign ordinance; and 
d.  The change is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any party. 
(5)  Nothing in these provisions shall be construed to deny the planning commission power to require any modification of, or release from, any provision of the comprehensive sign plan so that the plan conforms to other city ordinances. 
(e)  Any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the planning commission or the zoning administrator pertaining to a comprehensive sign plan may be appealed to city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 14 days of the decision.

Sec. 56-490. - Nonconforming signs and outdoor commercial advertising devices. 
(a)  Any existing sign which has previously been granted a variance shall be considered conforming for the purpose of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
(b)  Subject to the termination provisions below, use of a nonconforming sign that did conform to the Sheridan Zoning Code or regulations at the time that the sign was originally installed or constructed, (a "legal, nonconforming sign") may be continued. All legal, nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition, and shall not be: 
(1)  Changed to another nonconforming sign; 
(2)  Structurally altered; 
(3)  Altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign; 
(4)  Expanded; 
(5)  Reestablished after discontinuance for 90 consecutive days of the use to which the sign pertained; 
(6)  Continued after a change of the use or activity to which the sign pertains; or 
(7)  Reestablished after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the cost of replacement. 
(c)  Termination of legal, nonconforming signs. 
(1)  The purpose of amortization is not only to provide a reasonable grace period during which the owner is permitted to continue a legal, nonconforming sign, and to recover its economic investment, but also to assure that the district in which the nonconforming sign exists will eventually benefit from a substantial uniformity of permanent and conforming signs. 
(2)  To the extent that existing individual signs violates the area, height or setback limitations of this sign ordinance by ten percent or less, such signs shall be considered to be a conforming sign and need not be removed or altered. However, if such sign is to be replaced or renovated, the sign shall be made to conform to all provisions of this Code. 
(3)  Any property that has signs that are nonconforming because of the number of signs on the premises shall bring the number of signs into conformity no later than December 31, 2010. 
(4)  With the exception of existing off-premises advertising signs/billboards, any legal, nonconforming sign that is nonconforming for any reason other than the number of signs may be maintained until December 31, 2015, at which time the sign shall be made conforming. 
(5)  Abandonment of any sign for a continuous period of 180 days shall terminate the right to maintain a nonconforming sign. 
(6)  The right to continued use of a legal, nonconforming sign shall terminate immediately if such sign is damaged or destroyed, and the cost to repair, restore or replace the sign exceeds 50 percent of the cost of a new sign.

Such a condition may require the execution of a development agreement that provides for such construction or installation, and for financial security to ensure completion of such improvement. 
(b)  City council shall have the authority to assess school and parkland dedications at the time of property zoning and rezoning for those zoning changes which increase the potential number of dwelling units on the property. Such dedications shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 55 (Dedications). Assessment of fees in lieu of land dedication shall occur at the time of zoning, and shall be based upon permitted uses on the site. Said fees shall be collected at the time of subsequent subdivision or building permit issuance, whichever shall occur first. Fees shall be adjusted as necessary at the time of either subdivision or building permit issuance to reflect development which results in densities and/or unit types different from those assumed at the time of initial assessment. Conveyance of land to be dedicated shall occur at the time of subsequent subdivision, or prior to issuance of any building permits.

(1)  Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance, modification, and removal of wireless communications infrastructure in the city with the goal of having the fewest number of wireless communication facilities ("WCF") required to complete a network without unreasonably discriminating against wireless communications providers of functionally equivalent services, including all of those who install, maintain, operate, and remove WCFs; 
(2)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the visibility of WCFs to the fullest extent possible through techniques including, but not limited to, camouflage design techniques and undergrounding of WCFs and the equipment associated therewith; 
(3)  Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive WCFs to supplement existing larger WCFs; 
(4)  Encourage the use of wall mounted panel antennas; 
(5)  Encourage roof mounted antennas only when wall mounted antennas will not provide adequate service or are not otherwise feasible; 
(6)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas, in a manner that minimizes the total number of towers needed throughout the community; 
(7)  Encourage strongly the colocation of WCFs on new and existing sites; 
(8)  Encourage owners and users of antennas and towers to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimized; 
(9)  Enhance the ability of wireless communications service providers to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(10)  Effectively manage WCFs in the right-of-way; 
(11)  Manage amateur radio facilities and over-the-air receiving devices in the city.

( Ord. No. 9-2017 ,  1, 9-25-2017; Ord. No. 12-2018,  2, 11-26-2018 ) 
Sec. 56-604. - Operational standards. 
(a)  Federal requirements. All WCFs shall meet the current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Authority ("FAA"), the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs. If such standards and regulations are amended, then the owners of the WCF governed by this article shall bring such facility into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to meet such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Permission to use within rights-of-way or upon public property. For WCFs in the right-of-way, the applicant shall execute a master license agreement with the city, granting applicant a non-exclusive license to use the right-of-way. Applicants shall also, as applicable execute supplemental site licenses with the city for each facility subject to the master license agreement. An annual attachment fee shall be required for each supplemental site license involving the attachment of WCF's to any city owned structure within the right-of-way. Master licenses and supplemental site licenses are subject to administrative processing fees and such fees along with the attachment fee shall be established by resolution of city council. Attachment of WCFs on an existing traffic signal, street light pole, or similar structure shall require written evidence of a license, or other legal right or approval, to use such structure by its owner. Prior to, or concurrently with, seeking land use approval for a WCF on public property, the applicant shall execute a lease agreement with the city. 
(c)  Signal interference. All WCFs shall be designed and sited consistent with applicable federal regulations so as not to cause interference with the normal operation of radio, television, telephone and other communication services utilized by adjacent residential and non-residential properties; nor shall any such facilities interfere with any public safety communications. The applicant shall provide a written statement from a qualified radio frequency engineer, certifying that a technical evaluation of existing and proposed facilities indicates no potential interference problems and shall allow the city to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during this process. Additionally, the applicant shall notify the city at least ten calendar days prior to the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, and shall allow the city to monitor interference levels with public safety communications during the testing process. 
(d)  Legal access. In all applications for WCFs an applicant must warrant and represent that it has the written agreement of the owner of the property which is the subject of the application for legal access to and from the WCF and the applicant must also warrant and represent that it will have legal access to the utilities to operate and maintain the WCF. 
(e)  Operation and maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of WCFs, the owner of a WCF shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building and safety codes. If upon inspection, the city concludes that a WCF fails to comply with such codes and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon written notice being provided to the owner of the WCF, the owner shall have 30 days from the date of notice to bring such WCF into compliance. Upon good cause shown by the owner, the city's building official may extend such compliance period not to exceed 90 days from the date of said notice. If the owner fails to bring such WCF into compliance within said time period, the city may remove such WCF at the owner's expense. 
(f)  Abandonment and removal. If a WCF has not been in use for a period of three months, the owner of the WCF shall notify the city of the non-use and shall indicate whether re-use is expected within the ensuing three months. Any WCF that is not operated for a continuous period of six months shall be considered abandoned. The city, in its sole discretion, may require an abandoned WCF to be removed. The owner of such WCF shall remove the same within 30 days of receipt of written notice from the city. If the WCF is not removed within said 30 days, the city may remove it at the owner's expense and any approved permits for the WCF shall be deemed to have expired. Additionally, the city, in its sole discretion, shall not approve any new WCF application until the applicant, if also an owner or operator of an abandoned WCF, has removed such WCF or payment for such removal has been made to the city. 
( Ord. No. 9-2017 ,  1, 9-25-2017; Ord. No. 12-2018,  3, 4, 11-26-2018 ) 
Sec. 56-605. - Design standards. 
(a)  The requirements set forth in this section shall apply to the location and design of all WCFs governed by this section; provided, however, that the city may waive these requirements it if determines that the goals of this section are better served thereby. To that end, WCFs shall be designed and located to minimize the impact on the surrounding neighborhood and to maintain the character and appearance of the city, consistent with other provisions of the Code. 
(1)  Camouflage/concealment. All WCFs and any transmission equipment shall, to the extent possible, use camouflage design techniques including, but not limited to the use of materials, colors, textures, screening, undergrounding, landscaping, or other design options that will blend the WCF to the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Design, materials and colors of WCFs shall be compatible with the surrounding environment. Designs shall be compatible with structures and vegetation on the same parcel and adjacent parcels. 
a.  Camouflage design may be of heightened importance where findings of particular sensitivity are made (e.g., proximity to historic or aesthetically significant structures, views, and/or community features). In such instances where WCFs are located in areas of high visibility, they shall (where possible) be designed (e.g., placed underground, depressed, or located behind earth berms) to minimize their profile. 
b.  The camouflage design may include the use of alternative tower structures should the director determine that such design meets the intent of the Code and the community is better served thereby. 
c.  All WCFs, such as antennas, vaults, equipment rooms, equipment enclosures, and tower structures shall be constructed out of non-reflective materials (visible exterior surfaces only). 
(2)  Hazardous materials. No hazardous materials shall be permitted in association with WCFs, except those necessary for the operations of the WCF and only in accordance with all applicable laws governing such materials. 
(3)  Colocation. WCFs shall be designed and constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the city approves an alternative design to the extent such design is reasonably feasible based upon construction, engineering and design standards. No WCF owner or operator shall unreasonably exclude a telecommunications competitor from using the same facility or location. Upon request by the city, the owner or operator shall provide evidence demonstrating why colocation is not possible at a particular facility or site. 
(4)  Siting. 
a.  No portion of any WCF may extend beyond the property line of the lot upon which it is located. 
b.  Colocation . WCFs may be required to be designed and constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the city approves an alternative design. No WCF owner or operator shall unfairly exclude a competitor from using the same facility or location. 
c.  WCFs shall be sited in a location that does not reduce the parking for the other principal uses on the parcel below Code standards. 
(5)  Lighting. WCFs shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable governmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on a light pole or other similar structure primarily used for lighting purposes. If lighting is required, the city may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of glare and light falling onto nearby properties, particularly residences. 
(6)  Landscaping and fencing requirements. 
a.  WCFs shall be sited in a manner that does not reduce the landscaped areas for the other principal uses on the parcel, below Code standards. 
b.  WCFs shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the WCF from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of the front, side, and rear landscaped setback on the perimeter of the site. 
c.  In locations where the visual impact of the WCF would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the director. 
d.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as WCFs sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the site perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
e.  No trees larger than four inches in diameter measured at four and one-half feet high on the tree may be removed, unless authorized by the director. To obtain such authorization the applicant shall show that tree removal is necessary, the applicant's plan minimizes the number of trees to be removed and any trees removed are replaced at a ratio of 2 to 1. 
(7)  Noise. Noise generated on the site must not exceed the standards in the Code, except that a WCF owner or operator shall be permitted to exceed Code noise standards for a reasonable period of time during repairs, not to exceed two hours without prior authorization from the city. 
(8)  Adjacent to single-family residential uses. WCFs shall be sited in a manner that considers the proximity of the facility to residential structures and residential district boundaries. When placed by residential property, the WCF shall be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between adjoining residential properties, such that the WCF minimizes visual impacts equitably among adjacent properties. In the case of a corner lot, the WCF may be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between adjoining residential properties, or on the corner formed by two intersecting streets. If these requirements are not reasonably feasible from a construction, engineering or design perspective, the applicant may submit a written statement to the director requesting the WCF be exempt from these requirements. 
(9)  Additional design requirements shall be applicable to the various types of WCFs as specified below: 
a.  Base stations. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, or alternative tower structure, such as a base station (including, but not limited to the antennas and accessory equipment) it shall be of a neutral, non-reflective color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure, or uses other camouflage/concealment design techniques so as to make the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible, including for example, without limitation, painting the antennas and accessory equipment to match the structure. Additionally, any ground-mounted equipment shall be located, based upon the reasonable discretion of the city, in a manner necessary to address both public safety and aesthetic concerns and may, where appropriate, require a flush-to-grade underground equipment vault. 
b.  Alternative tower structures and small cell facilities. 
1.  Shall be designed and constructed to look like a building, facility, or structure typically found in the area; 
2.  Be camouflaged/concealed consistent with other existing natural or manmade features in the immediate proximity of the location where the alternative tower structure will be located;

11.  Shall not alter vehicular circulation or parking within the right-of-way or impede vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian access or visibility along the right-of-way. Must comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and all applicable local, state, and federal law and regulations. No alternative tower structure nor small cell facility may be located or maintained in a manner that causes unreasonable interference. Unreasonable interference means any use of the right-of-way that disrupts or interferes with this use by the city, the general public, or other person authorized to use or be present upon the right-of-way, when there exists an alternative that would result in less disruption or interference. Unreasonable interference includes any use of the right-of-way that disrupts vehicular or pedestrian traffic, any interference with public utilities, and any other activity that will present a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare. 
d.  Towers. 
1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or, subject to any applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness as determined by the city; 
2.  Tower structures should use existing land forms, vegetation, and structures to aid in screening the facility from view or blending in with the surrounding built and natural environment; 
3.  Monopole support structures shall taper from the base to the tip; 
4.

Each applicant for a WCF shall provide to the director a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then currently proposed WCFs within the city, and outside of the city within one mile of its boundaries. In addition, the applicant shall inform the city generally of the areas of the city in which it believes WCFs may need to be located within the next three years. The inventory list should identify the site name, site address, and a general description of the facility (for example, rooftop antennas and ground mounted equipment). This provision is not intended to be a requirement that the applicant submit its business plan, proprietary information, or make commitments regarding locations of WCFs within the city. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the city and all applicants for WCFs to share general information, assist in the city's comprehensive planning process, and promote colocation by identifying areas in which WCFs might be appropriately constructed for multiple users. 
The city may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate WCFs within the jurisdiction of the city, provided however, that the city is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(3)  Abandonment and removal. Prior to approval, affidavits shall be required from the owner of the property and from the applicant acknowledging that each is responsible for the removal of a WCF that is abandoned or is unused for a period of six months. 
(4)  In all zoning districts, applications for base stations, alternative tower structures, and towers may be permitted only as a conditional use in accordance with the requirements of this article. All applications for towers shall demonstrate that other alternative design options such as base stations or alternative tower structures are not viable options as determined by the city. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, no towers located in the right-of-way shall exceed 35 feet in height. 
(5)  Applications for base stations, alternative tower structures and small cell facilities within right-of-way. In all zoning districts each application for a base station, alternative tower structure or small cell facility within the right-of-way shall be reviewed and considered for approval by the director for conformance with this article and the applicant's execution of a license agreement as approved by the director. Applicants may appeal the director's decision by submitting a written notice of appeal to the city manager within ten calendar days from the date of the director's decision. The notice of appeal must specifically set forth the grounds for appeal and include all documentation the applicant deems relevant. The city manager shall within ten business days of receipt of the notice of appeal and review of all documentation submitted by the applicant and the director's decision issue a final decision which may affirm, overturn or modify the director's decision. 
Except for WCFs in the right-of-way that meet all requirements of this article, the director may refer the application to planning and zoning commission for conditional use review if the director finds the proposed WCF to have a significant visual impact (e.g., proximity to historic or designated view corridors, or on significant community features), or otherwise is substantially incompatible with the structure on which the WCF will be installed, or it does not meet the clear intent of this article. 
(6)  Review procedures for eligible facilities requests. 
a.  Application. In all zoning districts, eligible facilities requests shall be considered a use by right subject to administrative review. The city shall prepare, and make publicly available, an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the city to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. Such information may include, without limitation, whether the request: 
1.  Would result in a substantial change; 
2.  Violate a generally applicable law, regulations, or other rule codifying objective standards reasonably related to public health and safety. 
The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification or colocation. 
b.  Type of review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this section, the director shall review such application to determine whether the application so qualifies. 
c.  Timeframe for review. Subject to the tolling provisions of subparagraph d. below, within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this section, the city shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this subsection. 
d.  Tolling of the timeframe for review. The 60-day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of the city and the applicant, or in cases where the director determines that the application is incomplete: 
1.  To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the city must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application; 
2.  The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental written submission in response to the city's notice of incompleteness; and 
3.  Following a supplemental submission, the city will notify the applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in subsection (d)(1). In the case of a second or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the city may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 
e.  Failure to act. In the event the city fails to act on a request seeking approval for an eligible facilities request under this section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when the applicant notifies the city in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. 
f.  Interaction with Telecommunications Act section 332(c)(7). If the city determines that the applicant's request is not an eligible facilities request as set forth in this article the presumptively reasonable timeframe under section 332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's shot clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the city's decision that the application is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the city may request additional information from the applicant to evaluate the application under section 332(c)(7) reviews. 
(7)  Decision. Any decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a WCF, shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. The applicant shall receive a copy of the decision. 
(8)  Compliance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the approval of an application for colocation as described herein, all work done pursuant to WCF applications must be completed in accordance with all applicable building and safety requirements as set forth in the Code and any other applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations. In addition, all WCF applications shall comply with the following: 
a.  Comply with any permit or license issued by a local, state, or federal agency with jurisdiction of the WCF; 
b.  Comply with easements, covenants, conditions and/or restrictions on or applicable to the underlying real property; 
c.  Be maintained in good working condition and to the standards established at the time of application approval; and 
d.  Remain free from trash, debris, litter, noxious weeds, graffiti, and other forms of vandalism. Any damage shall be repaired as soon as practicable, and in no instance more than ten calendar days from the time of notification by the city or after discovery by the owner or operator of the site. 
(9)  Compliance report. Upon request by the city, the applicant shall provide a compliance report within 45 days after installation of a WCF, demonstrating that as installed and in operation, the WCF complies with all conditions of approval, all applicable Code requirements and standard regulations.

(a)  The city council has enacted this article as a joint benefit to the public at large and to private owners for the purposes of: providing the city with increased sales tax revenues generated upon and by properties improved as a result of this program; encouraging the construction of public improvements by private owners without debt obligations being incurred by the city; and allowing owners and proprietors opportunities to improve properties which generate sales activities, which improvements make those properties more competitive in the marketplace and further provide to owners and proprietors additional contingent sources of revenues for upgrading said properties. 
(b)  The city council specifically finds and determines that creation of this ESTIP is consistent with the city's powers as a municipal corporation, and that exercise of those powers in this article promotes the public health, safety and general welfare. Notwithstanding any provision hereof, the city shall never be a joint venturer in any private entity or activity which participates in the ESTIP, and the city shall never be liable or responsible for any debt or obligation of any participant in ESTIP.

The base amount shall never be lower then the amount of sales taxes collected by the city at the property in question in the previous 12 months plus a reasonable and agreed upon percentage of anticipated increase in sales taxes or, in the case of a newly established business, an amount which represents the good faith determination by the applicant and the city as to the amount of sales taxes which could be generated from the new business without the participation by the applicant in the ESTIP. 
    Owner or proprietor shall mean the record owner or operator of an individual business or, in the case of a shopping center, the owner of the real property upon which more the one business is operated, provided that said owner (whether an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity) is the owner or lessor of the individual businesses operated thereon. 
(Code 1986,  12-165) 
Sec. 62-60. - Eligibility. 
    Participation in ESTIP shall be based upon approval by the city council, exercising its legislative discretion in good faith. Any owner or proprietor of a newly established or proposed retail business, or the owner or proprietor of an existing retail business which wishes to expand substantially, may apply to the city for inclusion within the ESTIP provided that the new or expanded business is reasonably likely to generate enhanced or increased sales taxes of at least $5,000.00 in the first year after entering an ESTIP agreement. 
(Code 1986,  12-166) 
Sec. 62-61. - Limitations. 
    Approval by the city council of an agreement implementing this ESTIP shall entitle the successful applicant to share in enhanced sales taxes derived from applicant's property or business in an amount which shall not exceed 50 percent of the enhanced sales taxes; provided, however, that the applicant shall use said amounts only for public or public-related purposes such as those specified in subsection 62-62(b) and which are expressly approved by the city council at the time of consideration of the application. The time period in which said enhanced sales taxes may be shared shall not commence until all public or public-related improvements are completed, and shall be limited by the city council, in its discretion, to a specified time, or until a specified amount of enhanced sales taxes has been collected. 
(Code 1986,  12-167) 
Sec. 62-62. - Obligations of participants. 
(a)  The uses to which any shared enhanced sales taxes may be put by an applicant shall be strictly limited to those which are public or public-related in nature. 
(b)  For the purposes of this article, the term "public or public-related purposes" shall mean the public improvements, including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, pedestrian malls, street lights, drainage facilities, landscaping, decorative structures, statuaries, fountains, identification signs, traffic safety devices, bicycle paths, off-street parking facilities, benches, restrooms, information booths, public meeting facilities, and all necessary, incidental, and appurtenant structures and improvements together with the relocation and improvement of existing utility lines, and any other improvements of a similar nature which are specifically approved by the city council upon the city council's findings that said improvements are public or public-related improvements, and that such improvements shall enhance the competitive position of the applicant within the Denver Metropolitan Area marketplace. 
(c)  Nothing contained herein shall limit the city council from appropriating additional capital improvement funds for capital improvements directly or indirectly affecting the property in question as a part of the city's regular appropriation, capital improvement, or budget process.

If in any month the agreed base amount is not met by an owner or proprietor and, thus, no enhanced sales taxes are generated for that month, no funds shall be shared with the owner or proprietor for said month, and no increment shall be shared until that deficit, and any other cumulative deficit, has been met, so that at the end of any 12-month period, funds in excess of those "enhanced sales taxes" agreed to be shared shall not have been shared with any owner or proprietor. 
(Code 1986,  12-169) 
Sec. 62-64. - Accounting. 
(a)  It is an overriding consideration and determination of the city council that existing sources of city sales tax revenues shall not be used, impaired, or otherwise affected by this enhanced sales tax incentive program. Therefore, the city council conclusively determines that only enhanced sales taxes generated by the properties described in an application, and a subsequent agreement, shall be subject to division under this article. 
(b)  It shall be the affirmative duty of the treasurer of the city to collect and hold all such "enhanced sales taxes" in a separate account apart from the sales taxes generated by, and collected from, any other sales tax generating sources within the city and to provide an accounting system which accomplishes the overriding purpose of this section. 
(c)  The city council conclusively states that this article would not be adopted or implemented but for the provisions of this section.

Sec. 62-66. - Agreement. 
    Each application for approval submitted to the city council shall be subject to approval by the city council solely on its own merits. Approval of an application shall require that an agreement be executed by the owner or proprietor and the city, which agreement shall, at a minimum, contain: 
(1)  A list of those public or public-related improvements which justify the owner's or proprietor's inclusion within the ESTIP, and the amount which shall be spent by the owner or proprietor on said improvements; 
(2)  The maximum amount of enhanced sales taxes to be shared, and the maximum time during which said agreement shall continue, it being expressly understood that any such agreement shall expire and be of no further force and effect upon the occurrence of the earlier to be reached of the maximum time of the agreement (whether or not the maximum amount to be shared has been reached) or the maximum amount to be shared (whether or not the maximum time set forth has expired); 
(3)  A statement that this is a personal agreement between the owner or proprietor and the city which is not transferable and which does not run with the land; 
(4)  A statement that the agreement shall never constitute a debt or obligation of the city within any constitutional or statutory provision; 
(5)  The base amount which is agreed upon by month, and the fact that if, in any month as specified, sales taxes received from the property do not at least equal said amount, that there shall be no sharing of enhanced sales tax funds for said month; 
(6)  The base tax amount agreed upon in the agreement shall consider the historic level of sales at the property in question, or a similar property within the area in the event of a new business, and a reasonable allowance for increased sales due to the improvements and upgrades completed as a result of inclusion within the ESTIP; 
(7)  A provision that any enhanced sales taxes subject to sharing shall be escrowed in the event there is a legal challenge to the enhanced sales tax incentive program or the approval of any application therefor; 
(8)  An affirmative statement that the obligations, benefits, and provisions of the agreement may not be assigned in whole or in any part without the express, written authorization of the city council, and further that no third party shall be entitled to rely upon or enforce any provision of the agreement or this article; and

(c)  Taxpayer request for records. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to any taxpayer or a taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a copy of any return or report filed in connection with a taxpayers tax, and such copies may be certified by the city manager, and when so certified shall be evidence equally with and in like manner as the originals and may be received by the courts of this state as evidence of the contents.

Sec. 62-148. - Assessment; penalties and interest. 
(a)  Assessment. The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall apply if the city manager determines that any person has failed, neglected, or refused: 
(1)  To collect all taxes due;

(3)  To remit the proper amount of tax due; 
(4)  To pay in full all taxes due because of negligence, fraud or on a regular basis; or

(c)  Estimated assessment. If the city manager is unable to audit the records of a taxpayer, either due to the taxpayer's refusal or lack of cooperation, due to time constraints, or due to other reasons which the city manager may reasonably determine, the city manager shall make an estimate based upon such information as may be available and shall issue an assessment as provided herein. If any person neglects or refuses to make a return, the city manager shall make an estimate, based upon such information as may be available, of the taxes due for the period for which such person is delinquent. 
(d)  Failure to file; penalty. If any person neglects or refuses to make a return as required by this article or fails to pay any sales or use tax as required by this article, and/or unless the taxpayer shows that its failure to comply fully with this article is due to reasonable cause, which the taxpayer may prove in a hearing requested pursuant to this article, the city manager shall make an estimate, based upon such information as may be available, of the amount of taxes due for the period for which the taxpayer is delinquent and shall add thereto a penalty equal to the greater of the sum of $15.00 or 15 percent thereof, and interest on such delinquent taxes at the rate of 11/2 percent from the date when due. 
(e)  Mathematical error on tax returns. In the event that the amount of tax is understated on the taxpayer's return due to a mathematical error, the city manager shall notify the taxpayer by written Notice of Final Determination-Assessment and Demand for Payment of the amount of tax in excess of that shown in the return which is due and has been assessed. The taxpayer shall have no right of protest or appeal as in the matter of other assessments but shall pay the tax due and assessed or file an amended return to show the true amount of tax due within 15 days of the date that such assessment is sent by the city manager. 
(f)  Penalty for fraud. If any deficiency in taxes paid is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, there shall be added, instead of the penalty prescribed in subsection (d) above, a penalty of 100 percent of the total amount of the deficiency to the assessment required by subsection (a) above. Interest on such deficiency shall accrue and be collected at a rate of 11/2 percent per month on the amount of such deficiency from the time the return was due. 
(g)  Special penalty for repeated enforcement. In any assessment issued to any person against whom enforcement proceedings have been commenced in the past, a special penalty, in addition to all others provided in this article, shall also be assessed. This special penalty shall be equal to the greater of $250.00 or 25 percent of the tax deficiency. For purposes of this subsection, the term "enforcement proceedings" shall mean: 
(1)  Issuance of a distraint warrant; 
(2)  Filing of a lawsuit in any court having jurisdiction hereto; or 
(3)  Three occurrences of the revocation of the person's sales tax license by the city manager or issuance of a summons to municipal court for the nonpayment of taxes or a combination of revocations and summonses.

The city manager is hereby authorized to waive, for good cause shown as determined in the sole discretion of the city manager, any penalty assessed as provided in this article. If the city manager finds that a taxpayer has, in good faith, paid tax to a vendor, then the city manager is hereby authorized to abate any portion of the interest and penalty assessed. 
(i)  Interest and penalty assessment. Interest and penalties prescribed under this article shall be paid upon notice and demand, and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the tax to which it is applicable. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of an overpayment, then no interest or penalty shall be imposed under this section on the portion of the tax so satisfied. 
(j)  In addition to penalties and interest prescribed herein, there shall be assessed an amount, determined by resolution of city council, costs for the issuance of each delinquent notice and notice of final determination and demand for payment.

Sec. 62-149. - Jeopardy assessment. 
(a)  Jeopardy enforcement. If the city manager finds that collection of the tax will be jeopardized by delay, in his/her discretion, he/she may declare the taxable period immediately terminated, determine the tax, and issue notice and demand for payment thereof; and, having done so, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith, and the city manager may proceed immediately to collect such tax as provided in section 62-147. 
(b)  Immediate enforcement action. In any other case wherein it appears that the revenue is in jeopardy, the city manager may immediately issue demand for payment; and, regardless of the provisions of sections 62-151 and 62-152, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith and, in his/her discretion, the city manager may proceed immediately to collect said tax as provided in section 62-147. 
(c)  Security for payment. Collection under either subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be stayed if the taxpayer gives such security for payment as shall be satisfactory to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-9), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-150. - Notice by mail. 
    The taxpayer shall at all times have the burden of ensuring that the taxpayer's current mailing address, email address, and fax number is on file with the city manager.

(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-10), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-151. - Hearings. 
(a)  Request for hearing. Any taxpayer may request a formal or informal hearing on any tax by reason of Notice of Final Determination-Assessment and Demand for Payment or by reason of denial of the taxpayer's claim for refund by application to the city manager within 15 days of the date that a notice of deficiency, assessment or denial of refund is sent by the city manager. The request for hearing shall be in writing and set forth the taxpayer's reasons for and the amount of the requested changes in the deficiency, assessment or denial of refund. Failure to request a hearing within the time specified within this subsection shall be deemed a waiver of a taxpayer's hearing rights including the right to contest such liability either administratively before the city manager or the executive director of the state department of revenue pursuant to state statute or judicial review pursuant to state statute. 
(b)  Hearing time and place. Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the city manager shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the time and place for such hearing 30 days prior thereto, unless the taxpayer and the city manager otherwise agree to a hearing date. In no event shall the hearing be held more than 60 days after the city manager's receipt of request for a hearing. The hearing shall be held at city hall. 
(c)  Informal hearing. If the taxpayer elects to participate in an informal hearing, any additional informal hearings shall not be permitted except at the discretion of the city manager. Informal hearings shall be conducted in a manner acceptable to the taxpayer and the city manager with the purpose of settling the outstanding issues between the parties. If no settlement is reached, the taxpayer must, if the taxpayer desires a formal hearing, request in writing to the city manager a formal hearing within 15 days after the informal hearing. Upon receipt of a request, the city manager shall give notice of the formal hearing pursuant to subsection (b) above. If the taxpayer fails to request a formal hearing, as specified herein, all further rights to a hearing and any appeal are waived as specified in subsection (a) of this section and the taxpayer shall be bound by the Notice of Final Determination-Assessment and Demand for Payment or final Denial of Refund. 
(d)  City manager to conduct formal hearing. The hearing shall be held before the city manager, or a hearing officer designated by the city manager. Upon the city's notice to the taxpayer of the formal hearing, the taxpayer shall deposit with the city 50 percent of the amount of the tax deficiency at dispute. The taxpayer shall also pay the city all tax amounts and related penalties and interest not in dispute. The taxpayer may request permission to post security or a bond in lieu of cash payment, which request shall be granted if the city manager determines the bond or security is adequate to protect the city's interest. Failure to post the bond or security shall result in denial of the taxpayers appeal. At the hearing, the taxpayer may assert any facts, present any arguments and submit any briefs, affidavits or other documents the taxpayer asserts are relevant to the matter. The taxpayer shall be notified of the name of the hearing officer 15 days before the hearing date and any objection by the taxpayer to the hearing officer shall be filed in writing at least ten days prior to the hearing. A hearing officer will not be dismissed unless the city manager determines, from information submitted by the taxpayer, that the hearing officer cannot act in a fair and impartial manner. All reasonable costs incurred by the city for a hearing officer must be paid by the taxpayer requesting the formal hearing when the hearing officer determines no change in the tax due. 
(e)  Failure to request hearing final determination. After the expiration of 15 days from the date that the Notice of Final Determination-Assessment and Demand for Payment or Denial of Refund is sent, if the tax has not been paid, or if no request for hearing has been requested, then the Notice of Final Determination-Assessment and Demand for Payment previously mailed, faxed, or emailed shall constitute a final assessment of the amount of the tax specified, together with interest and penalty, or as applicable shall constitute a final Denial of Refund. The city manager may promptly take all necessary steps to collect all amounts owed. 
(f)  City manager may adjust tax under question. Based on the evidence presented at any hearing or filed in support of the taxpayer's contentions, the city manager may modify or abate part or in full the tax and the interest and penalty related to such tax questioned at the hearing or may approve a refund. 
(g)  Formal hearing determination notices. Within 30 days after completion of the hearing, the city manager shall send a hearing determination notice to the taxpayer setting forth the amount of claim for refund denied or the amount of deficiency assessment of taxes found due, stating therein the grounds for allowance or rejection in whole or in part. 
(h)  Tax due date after hearing. Unless an appeal is taken as provided in section 62-152, the tax, together with interest thereon and penalties, if any, shall be paid within 30 days after the hearing determination notice is sent by the city manager to the taxpayer. 
(i)  Oaths. The city manager is authorized to administer oaths and take testimony at any hearing held pursuant to this article. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-11), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-152. - Appeals. 
    Any appeal of the hearing determination notice of the city manager issued pursuant to section 62-151 shall be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the method of appeals set forth in C.R.S.  29-2-106, as amended. The taxpayer shall have no right to appeal if the taxpayer has not exhausted all administrative remedies within the times prescribed and procedures set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-12), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-153. - Refunds. 
(a)  Disputed tax. Should a dispute arise between the purchaser and seller as to whether or not any sale, service, or commodity is exempt from taxation under this article, the seller shall nevertheless collect and the purchaser shall pay the tax and the seller shall issue to the purchaser a receipt or certificate, on forms prescribed by the city manager, showing the names of the seller and the purchaser, the items purchased, the date, price, amount of tax paid, and a brief statement of the claim of exemption. 
(b)  Refund allowed if exempt. A refund shall be made, or a credit allowed, for the tax so paid under dispute by any purchaser who is exempt from payment under this article provided such refund shall be made by the city manager after compliance with the following conditions. Applications for refund must be made within 60 days after the purchase of the goods whereon an exemption is claimed and must be supported by the affidavit of the purchaser accompanied by the original paid invoice or sales receipt and certificate issued by the seller; and be made upon such forms as shall be prescribed and furnished by the city manager. 
(c)  Refund disallowed. Upon receipt of such application, the city manager shall examine same and shall give notice to the applicant by order in writing of his/her decision. Aggrieved applicants, within 15 days after such decision is sent, may petition the city manager for a hearing on the claim in the manner provided in section 62-151. 
(d)  Refund of excess taxes. Whenever the city manager discovers from the examination of a return or pursuant to an audit of a taxpayer's records that the taxpayer has overpaid taxes due the city, the city manager shall issue a warrant for payment of the excess taxes to the taxpayer, unless the overpayment is applied to offset other tax due. The city manager shall keep a duplicate of said warrant and also a statement which sets forth the reason why such refund was ordered. If the refund totals less than $15.00, the refund amount shall be credited to the taxpayer's tax account, unless the taxpayer requests payment of the refund. 
(e)  Taxpayer's discovery of overpayment of tax. A taxpayer may apply for a refund of payment of excess taxes within 60 days after discovery of the overpayment. The city manager may deny such refund if the city manager determines the taxpayer did or reasonably should have discovered the overpayment more than 60 days prior to the date of the application for a refund. The taxpayer may petition the city manager for a hearing on the claim in the manner provided in section 62-151 within 15 days after the city manager's Denial of Refund is sent to the taxpayer. 
(f)  Statute of limitations. Except as provided in section 62-165, no refund shall be granted more than three years after the city's receipt of sales or use taxes in question. 
(g)  Refund to offset previous tax due. Whenever it is established that any taxpayer has, for any period, overpaid a tax imposed by this article, and that there is an unpaid balance of tax and interest accrued according to the records of the city manager, owing by such taxpayer for any other period, so much of the overpayment of tax plus interest allowable thereon as does not exceed the amount of such unpaid balance, shall be credited thereto and any excess of the overpayment shall be refunded. 
(h)  Refund of overpayment of taxes paid by the estimated payment basis. Application for refund by contractors prepaying on an estimated percentage payment basis, or actual tax basis, shall be made within three years after the date of the certificate of occupancy or date of purchase, whichever is sooner. The city manager may require documentation to accompany the application and may require an audit to be performed before a refund is paid. 
(i)  Refunds not assignable. The right of any person to a refund under this article shall not be assignable and such application for refund must be made by the same person who purchased the goods and paid the tax thereon as shown in the invoice of the sale thereof, except as provided in subsection (j) of this section. The city manager may, upon receiving a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and evidence to substantiate that the tax was remitted in error to another municipality, issue a joint refund check in the name of the taxpayer and the municipality, provided that the municipality has entered into an agreement to grant similar privileges to the city. 
(j)  Burden of proof of exemption. The burden of proving that sales, services, and commodities, on which tax refunds are claimed, are exempt from taxation or were not at retail, shall be on the person making such claim under such reasonable requirements of proof as the city manager may prescribe. 
(k)  Claims for recovery. The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect and remit sales and use taxes to the city. 
(1)  As used herein, the term "claim for recovery" means a claim for reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
(2)  When it is determined by the city manager that sales and use tax owed to the city has been reported and paid to another municipality, the city shall promptly notify the vendor that taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
(3)  The city may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the city, or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recovery lies in the sole discretion of the city. Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within 90 days of its receipt. The municipality to which the city submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(4)  Within 90 days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the city shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received, and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the city shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within 30 days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim of recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(5)  The city may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-13), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-154. - Interest on overpayments and refunds. 
(a)  Interest allowance basis. No interest shall be paid upon any overpayment of sales or use tax unless: 
(1)  Such overpayment was made under protest, and 
(2)  The taxpayer has requested a refund in writing within 60 days after the tax was paid. 
(b)  Payment of interest. 
(1)  Interest owed by the taxpayer on an audit may be applied against calculated interest that would be credited if allowed. 
(2)  Interest paid on an eligible overpayment of taxes pursuant to subsection (a) herein under protest shall be allowed at the rate of nine percent per annum. 
(3)  Interest shall accrue only from the date of the taxpayer's application for a refund. If the refund is to be applied against other taxes owed by the taxpayer, interest shall not be paid on the refund for the period after the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken. 
(c)  Refund erroneously made to bear interest. Any portion of a sales or use tax, or any interest, assessable penalty, additional amount, or additional tax, which has been erroneously refunded, shall bear interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date of the payment of the refund.

(a)  False statement refund prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any applicant for a refund under the provisions of this article to make any false statement in connection with such application. 
(b)  Action to recover fraudulent claims. If any person is convicted of a violation of subsection (a) of this section, such conviction shall be prima facie evidence that all refunds received by such person during the current year were obtained unlawfully and the city manager is hereby empowered and directed to bring appropriate collection proceedings for recovery of such refunds. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-15), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-156. - City manager's remedies in case of nonpayment.

(1)  Take such action as deemed necessary to revoke the taxpayer's sales tax license. 
(2)  Cause to be issued a summons and complaint to the person, to appear in the municipal court of the city on charges of violating this article.

Sec. 62-157. - Enforcing collection by distraint. 
(a)  Warrant. The city manager may issue a warrant under his/her own hand directed to any representative of the city, or the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding such person to distraint, seize, and sell the personal property of the taxpayer, except such personal property as is exempt from execution and sale by any provision of this article, for the payment of the tax due together with penalties and interest accrued thereon and collection costs, upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(b)  Distraint seizure. 
(1)  The agent charged with the collection shall make or cause to be made an account of the goods or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the agent making such distraint, shall be served by being left with the owner or possessor, or at his/her usual place of abode with some member of his/her family over the age of 18 years, or at his/her usual place of business with his/her stenographer, bookkeeper, or chief clerk, or if the taxpayer is a corporation, shall be left with any officer, manager, general agent, or agent for process, with a note of the sum demanded and the time and place of sale. If said notice cannot be served on the taxpayer within 30 miles of the city, it shall be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address, return receipt requested. 
(2)  The agent shall forthwith cause to be published a notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the property to be sold, in some newspaper within the county wherein distraint is made, or, in lieu thereof and in the discretion of the city manager, the agent or sheriff shall cause such notice to be publicly posted at the court house of the county wherein such distraint is made, and copies thereof to be posted in at least two other public places within said county. 
(3)  The time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days or more than 60 days from the date of such notification to the owner or possessor of the property and the publication or posting of such notices. Said sale may be adjourned from time to time by said agent or sheriff if he/she deems it advisable, but not for a time to exceed in all 90 days from the date first fixed for the sale. When any personal property is advertised for sale under distraint as aforesaid, the agent or sheriff making the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public auction, offering the same at not less than a fair minimum price, including the expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the fair minimum price so fixed, the agent or sheriff conducting the sale may, upon permission of the city manager, declare the same to be purchased by him/her for the city. The property so purchased may be sold by the agent or sheriff under such regulations as may be prescribed by the city manager. 
(4)  In any case of distraint for the payment of taxes, the real property, goods, chattels or effects so distrained shall be restored to the owner or possessor, if, prior to the sale, the amount due is paid, together with all other fees and charges or may be redeemed by any person holding a chattel mortgage or other evidence of right of possession. 
(c)  Certificate of sale and evidence of purchase. In all cases of sale, the agent or sheriff making the sale shall issue a certificate of sale to each purchaser, and such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the agent or sheriff to make such sale, and the conclusive evidence of the regularity of his/her proceedings in making the sale; and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property sold; and where such property consists of certificates of stock in the possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be notice, when received, to any person of said transfer, and said certificate of such sale shall be authority for such, person to record the transfer on its books and records; and where the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt, in the possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be good and valid evidence of title in the person holding the same, as against any other person. Any surplus remaining above the taxes, penalties, interest, all costs, and all expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale shall be returned to the owner, or such other person having a legal right thereto, and, on demand, the city manager shall render an account in writing of the sale. Expenses of a seizure include all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city in enforcing collection by distraint, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and all personnel costs of the city.

Sec. 62-158. - Recovery of unpaid tax by action at law. 
(a)  Action at law. The city manager may also treat any such taxes, penalties, or interest due and unpaid as a personal debt due the city from the taxpayer. In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the city manager may receive at law the amount of such taxes, penalties, and interest and collection costs in any such court wherein venue may be proper under the applicable rule of civil procedure. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the city manager as herein provided shall be prima facie proof of the amount due. 
(b)  Writs of attachment. Such actions may be actions in attachment, and writs of attachment may be issued to the sheriff and in any such proceedings, no bond shall be required of the city manager nor shall any sheriff require of the city manager an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment, or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings; and the city manager may prosecute appeals or writs of error, in such cases without the necessity of providing bond therefor. The city attorney, when requested by the city manager, may commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this article, and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this article. 
(c)  Civil action to enforce lien against real property. In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the city, the city manager may cause a civil action to be filed in the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which is subject to said tax, to enforce the lien of the city for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property or any right, title or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall decree a sale of such real property and distribute the proceeds of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the interest of the parties and of the city; the proceedings in such action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale and the execution of deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires. 
(d)  Exhaustion of administrative remedies. No litigation seeking to enforce collection may be commenced by the city until the time for the taxpayer to exercise the taxpayer's administrative remedies or to file an appeal has expired. 
(Ord. No. 3-2005,  3(25-18), 2-23-2005) 
Sec. 62-159. - Sales and use tax constitutes lien. 
(a)  Any sales or use tax imposed by this article, together with the interest and penalties herein provided, and the cost of collection, shall be a first and prior lien upon: 
(1)  The goods, stock-in-trade, and business fixtures of or used by any taxpayer under lease, title-retaining contract or other contractual arrangement; and 
(2)  The real and personal property owned or leased by any such taxpayer, including personal property affixed to real property, and shall take precedence on all such property over other claims and mortgages. 
(b)  This lien shall arise upon the day the tax becomes due and payable and shall be extinguished by operation of law when the tax is paid in full, including any interest, penalty and collection costs. 
(c)  Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this article shall be placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized under distraint for property or other taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this article and for which said person is in any way liable under the terms of this article, shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of said taxpayer, and no sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this article under process or order of any court, without first ascertaining from the city manager the amount of any taxes due and payable under this article.

The city manager may deem an improperly filed return to be not filed with the city. A valid digital signature, or the equivalent thereof, on a filed return transmitted electronically over the internet or transmitted other similar means shall be accepted as a written signature.

If the accounting methods regularly employed by any taxpayer required to file a return are such that reporting on a calendar-month basis will impose unnecessary hardship, the city manager may upon request of such taxpayer accept returns at such intervals as will, in the city manager's opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer and will not jeopardize the collection of the tax. If any taxpayer who has been granted permission to file returns and pay tax on other than a monthly basis becomes delinquent, authorization for such alternate method of reporting may be revoked by the city manager. Thereafter following notice of such revocation, the taxpayer shall file returns and pay tax on a monthly basis.

(Ord. No. 1-2008,  1, 2-13-2008) 
Sec. 62-335. - Hearings. 
(a)  Request for hearing. Any taxpayer may request a formal or informal hearing on any tax by reason of notice of final determination-assessment and demand for payment or by reason of denial of the taxpayer's claim for refund by application to the city manager within 15 days of the date that a notice of deficiency, assessment or denial of refund is sent by the city manager. The request for hearing shall be in writing and set forth the taxpayer's reasons for and the amount of the requested changes in the deficiency, assessment or denial of refund. Failure to request a hearing within the time specified within this subsection shall be deemed a waiver of a taxpayer's hearing rights including the right to contest such liability either administratively before the city manager or the executive director of the state department of revenue pursuant to state statute or judicial review pursuant to state statute. 
(b)  Hearing time and place. Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the city manager shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the time and place for such hearing 30 days prior thereto, unless the taxpayer and the city manager otherwise agree to a hearing date. In no event shall the hearing be held more than 60 days after the city manager's receipt of request for a hearing. The hearing shall be held at city hall. 
(c)  Informal hearing. If the taxpayer elects to participate in an informal hearing, any additional informal hearings shall not be permitted except at the discretion of the city manager. Informal hearings shall be conducted in a manner acceptable to the taxpayer and the city manager with the purpose of settling the outstanding issues between the parties. If no settlement is reached, the taxpayer must, if the taxpayer desires a formal hearing, request in writing to the city manager a formal hearing within 15 days after the informal hearing. Upon receipt of a request, the city manager shall give notice of the formal hearing pursuant to subsection (b) above. If the taxpayer fails to request a formal hearing, as specified herein, all further rights to a hearing and any appeal are waived as specified in subsection (a) of this section and the taxpayer shall be bound by the notice of final determination-assessment and demand for payment or final denial of refund. 
(d)  City manager to conduct formal hearing. The hearing shall be held before the city manager, or a hearing officer designated by the city manager. Upon the city's notice to the taxpayer of the formal hearing, the taxpayer shall deposit with the city 50 percent of the amount of the tax deficiency at dispute. The taxpayer shall also pay the city all tax amounts and related penalties and interest not in dispute. The taxpayer may request permission to post security or a bond in lieu of cash payment, which request shall be granted if the city manager determines the bond or security is adequate to protect the city's interest. Failure to post the bond or security shall result in denial of the taxpayers appeal. At the hearing, the taxpayer may assert any facts, present any arguments and submit any briefs, affidavits or other documents the taxpayer asserts are relevant to the matter. The taxpayer shall be notified of the name of the hearing officer 15 days before the hearing date and any objection by the taxpayer to the hearing officer shall be filed in writing at least ten days prior to the hearing. A hearing officer will not be dismissed unless the city manager determines, from information submitted by the taxpayer, that the hearing officer cannot act in a fair and impartial manner. All reasonable costs incurred by the city for a hearing officer must be paid by the taxpayer requesting the formal hearing when the hearing officer determines no change in the tax due. 
(e)  Failure to request hearing final determination. After the expiration of 15 days from the date that the notice of final determination-assessment and demand for payment or denial of refund is sent, if the tax has not been paid, or if no request for hearing has been requested, then the notice of final determination-assessment and demand for payment previously mailed, faxed, or emailed shall constitute a final assessment of the amount of the tax specified, together with interest and penalty, or as applicable shall constitute a final denial of refund. The city manager may promptly take all necessary steps to collect all amounts owed. 
(f)  City manager may adjust tax under question. Based on the evidence presented at any hearing or filed in support of the taxpayer's contentions, the city manager may modify or abate part or in full the tax and the interest and penalty related to such tax questioned at the hearing or may approve a refund. 
(g)  Formal hearing determination notices. Within 30 days after completion of the hearing, the city manager shall send a hearing determination notice to the taxpayer setting forth the amount of claim for refund denied or the amount of deficiency assessment of taxes found due, stating therein the grounds for allowance or rejection in whole or in part. 
(h)  Tax due date after hearing. Unless an appeal is taken as provided in section 62-336, the tax, together with interest thereon and penalties, if any, shall be paid within 30 days after the hearing determination notice is sent by the city manager to the taxpayer.

(b)  Refund allowed if exempt. A refund shall be made, or a credit allowed, for the tax so paid under dispute by any purchaser who is exempt from payment under this article provided such refund shall be made by the city manager after compliance with the following conditions.

(d)  Refund of excess taxes. Whenever the city manager discovers from the examination of a return or pursuant to an audit of a taxpayer's records that the taxpayer has overpaid taxes due the city, the city manager shall issue a warrant for payment of the excess taxes to the taxpayer, unless the overpayment is applied to offset other tax due. The city manager shall keep a duplicate of said warrant and also a statement which sets forth the reason why such refund was ordered. If the refund totals less than $15.00, the refund amount shall be credited to the taxpayer's tax account, unless the taxpayer requests payment of the refund. 
(e)  Taxpayer's discovery of overpayment of tax. A taxpayer may apply for a refund of payment of excess taxes within 60 days after discovery of the overpayment. The city manager may deny such refund if the city manager determines the taxpayer did or reasonably should have discovered the overpayment more than 60 days prior to the date of the application for a refund. The taxpayer may petition the city manager for a hearing on the claim in the manner provided in section 62-335 within 15 days after the city manager's denial of refund is sent to the taxpayer. 
(f)  Statute of limitations. Except as provided in section 62-348, no refund shall be granted more than three years after the city's receipt of admission taxes in question. 
(g)  Refund to offset previous tax due. Whenever it is established that any taxpayer has, for any period, overpaid a tax imposed by this article, and that there is an unpaid balance of tax and interest accrued according to the records of the city manager, owing by such taxpayer for any other period, so much of the overpayment of tax plus interest allowable thereon as does not exceed the amount of such unpaid balance, shall be credited thereto and any excess of the overpayment shall be refunded. 
(h)  Burden of proof of exemption. The burden of proving that admissions, on which tax refunds are claimed, are exempt from taxation, shall be on the person making such claim under such reasonable requirements of proof as the city manager may prescribe. 
(i)  Claims for recovery. The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations regarding refunds or overpayment of taxes. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect and remit admissions tax to the city.

(3)  The time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days or more than 60 days from the date of such notification to the owner or possessor of the property and the publication or posting of such notices. Said sale may be adjourned from time to time by said agent or sheriff if he/she deems it advisable, but not for a time to exceed in all 90 days from the date first fixed for the sale. When any personal property is advertised for sale under distraint as aforesaid, the agent or sheriff making the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public auction, offering the same at not less than a fair minimum price, including the expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the fair minimum price so fixed, the agent or sheriff conducting the sale may, upon permission of the city manager, declare the same to be purchased by him/her for the city.

The city attorney, when requested by the city manager, may commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this article, and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this article. 
(c)  Civil action to enforce lien against real property. In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the city, the city manager may cause a civil action to be filed in the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which is subject to said tax, to enforce the lien of the city for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property or any right, title or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall decree a sale of such real property and distribute the proceeds of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the interest of the parties and of the city; the proceedings in such action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale and the execution of deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property.

(2)  The real and personal property owned or leased by any such taxpayer, including personal property affixed to real property, and shall take precedence on all such property over other claims and mortgages. 
(b)  This lien shall arise upon the day the tax becomes due and payable and shall be extinguished by operation of law when the tax is paid in full, including any interest, penalty and collection costs. 
(c)  Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this article shall be placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized under distraint for property or other taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this article and for which said person is in any way liable under the terms of this article, shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of said taxpayer, and no sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this article under process or order of any court, without first ascertaining from the city manager the amount of any taxes due and payable under this article. If there be any such taxes due, owing or unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay the amount of said taxes out of the proceeds of said sale before making payment of any moneys to judgment creditors or other claims of whatsoever nature. 
(d)  At any time a tax has accrued but is unpaid, the city manager may issue a notice of tax lien, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, the date of the accrual thereof, and that the city claims a first and prior lien therefor on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer. Said notice may be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in the state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property. Issuance of such notice and filing thereof shall be at the discretion of the city manager and shall not affect the priority or validity of the lien provided by this article, which arises by operation of law when the tax accrues and is payable. 
(e)  Any representative of the city manager to whom a distraint warrant has been issued may file a notice of lien in such forms as the city manager may prescribe with the person in possession of any personal property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer if not previously recorded with the county clerk and recorder. The city manager may release said lien as to any part or all of the property or rights to property covered by such lien upon such terms as he/she may deem proper. 
(f)  Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the county clerk and recorder as herein provided, upon payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest covered thereby, shall be released by the city manager in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released.

(f)  Seller and purchaser both liable. Until all taxes due under this section are paid in full, both the former owner and the purchaser shall remain personally liable thereon and subject to all collection proceedings available under this article. Action by the city against the former owner shall not prevent the exercise by the city of all remedies provided herein against the successor owner. 
(g)  Delinquent taxes are a lien on the property. Any person who takes or purchases personal or real property under lease, title retaining contract or other contract arrangement, by purchase, foreclosure sale, or otherwise, takes the same subject to the lien for any delinquent taxes owed by the original owner and shall be liable for the payment of all delinquent admission taxes, interest, penalty and collection costs of such prior owner, not however, exceeding the value of the property so taken or acquired.

Sec. 74-25. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. This article provides principles, procedures and associated funding for the placement of structures and facilities, construction excavation encroachments and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way, and to protect the integrity of the road system. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way, to establish permit procedures and to fix and collect fees and charges. 
(b)  Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the city must insure that the primary purpose of the right-of-way, passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the right-of-way corridors by private users is secondary to these public objectives, and the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities by: 
(1)  Insuring that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
(2)  Protecting the city's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way, when work is accomplished. 
(3)  Facilitating work within the rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  Maintaining an efficient permit process. 
(5)  Conserving and fairly apportioning the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the city. 
(6)  Establishing a public policy for enabling the city to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition and technological development. 
(7)  Promoting cooperation among the permittees (as defined herein) and the city in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly, (ii) lower the permittee's and the city's costs of providing services to the public, and (iii) minimize street cuts. 
(8)  Assuring that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

(a)  Right-of-way meetings. Permittee shall attend and participate in meetings of the city, of which the permittee is made aware, regarding right-of-way issues that may impact its facilities, including, planning meetings to anticipate joint trenching and boring. Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench or share bores or cuts, permittee shall work with other providers, licensees, permittees, and franchisees so as to reduce so far as possible the number of right-of-way cuts within the city and the amount of pedestrian and vehicular traffic that is obstructed or impeded. 
(b)  Minimal interference. Work in the right-of-way, on other public property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Permittee's facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with any other property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by, or under, the city's authority. The permittee's facilities shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with new improvements the city may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. 
(c)  Underground construction and use of poles. 
(1)  When required by the Code, resolutions, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal law, permittee's facilities shall be placed underground at no cost to the city. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances. 
(2)  Where all facilities are installed underground at the time of permittee's construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed underground, all permittee facilities shall also be placed underground at no expense to the city unless funding is generally available for such relocation to all users of the rights-of-way. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's applicable code requirements and rules. In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the permittee may install aerial facilities. 
(3)  For above ground facilities, the permittee shall utilize existing poles and conduit wherever possible. 
(4)  Should the city desire to place its own facilities in trenches or bores opened by the permittee, the permittee shall cooperate with the city in any construction by the permittee that involves trenching or boring, provided that the city has first notified the permittee in some manner that it is interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the permittee's construction is occurring. The permittee shall allow the city to place its facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the city incurs any incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. Should the city desire to install ducts or conduit for the possible use of other entities, then the permittee shall allow the city to place these facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, provided the city shares proportionally in the cost of trenching and boring. The city shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the permittee's trenches and bores under this paragraph. 
(d)  Use of conduits by the city. Unless otherwise restricted by tariff, the city may install or affix and maintain its own facilities for city purposes in or upon any and all of permittee's ducts, conduits or equipment in the rights-of-way and other public places, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties, to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable articles and codes. For the purposes of this subsection, "city purposes" includes, but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for city fire, police, traffic, water, telephone, and/or signal operations or systems. 
(e)  Common users. 
(1)  The rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities. Therefore, whenever the city determines it is impracticable to permit construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the rights-of-way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with permittee, and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or state law or regulations, the city may require permittee to afford to such entity the right to use permittee's surplus ducts or conduits in common with permittee, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus ducts or conduits entered into by permittee and the other entity. Nothing herein shall require permittee to enter into an agreement with such entity if, in permittee's reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of the permittee's facilities. 
(2)  All facilities shall meet any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between permittee and the other common user. Permittee may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common user shall pay permittee for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the common user's attachments cause permittee to incur.

Sec. 74-39. - Joint planning and construction; coordination of excavations. 
(a)  Excavations in city rights-of-way disrupt and interfere with the public use of city streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among permittees making excavations in city rights-of-way and between these permittees and the city. Coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure the excavations in city rights-of-way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the city. 
(b)  Any permittee owning, operating or installing facilities in city rights-of-way, providing water, sewer, gas, electric, communication, video or other utility services, shall meet annually with the director, at the director's request to discuss permittee's excavation master plan. At such meeting, to the extent not already in possession of the city, permittee shall submit documentation, in a form required by the director, showing a location of the permittee's existing facilities in the city rights-of-way. Permittee shall discuss with the director, its excavation master plan, and identify planned major excavation work in the city. The director may make his own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each permittee's planned major excavation work in the city; provided, however, that no such document prepared by the director shall identify a particular entity, or the planned major excavation work of that particular entity. Permittee shall meet with the director to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later than 60 days after submitting its first permit application. Thereafter, each permittee shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of January, a revised and updated excavation master plan. Such revised and updated plan shall be submitted in both hard copy and digital format.
