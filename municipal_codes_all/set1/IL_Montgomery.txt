    Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships and corporations as well as to males.

Words and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning. 
    Number. A word importing the singular number only may extend and be applied to several persons and things as well as to one person and thing. 
    Oath. The word "oath" shall be construed to include an affirmation in all cases in which, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in such cases the words "swear" and "sworn" shall be equivalent to the words "affirm" and "affirmed." 
    Officers generally. Whenever any officer is referred to by title, such as "village clerk," "chief of police," "president," etc., such reference shall be construed as if followed by the words "of the Village of Montgomery."

Sec. 1-6. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
    When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision shall be itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former ordinance, clause or provision unless it shall be therein so expressly provided. 
    The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance repealed. 
Sec. 1-7. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code.

    Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the village any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor or a violation of this Code, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor or a violation of this Code, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance shall be punished by a fine of not more than $750.00. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. Any second offenses committed by the same person within a 12-month period shall result in a fine of not less than $200.00.

State Law reference- Limitation on penalties, 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1. 
Sec. 1-9. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 953, § 3, adopted June 11, 2001, repealed § 1-9, Imprisonment until fine and costs paid, as derived from Ord. No. 22, § 18, adopted June 4, 1900. 
Sec. 1-10. - Fines and procedures for minor ordinance violations. 
(a)  Charging document: Any member of the police department, building department, or public works department of the village who would otherwise be authorized to arrest an individual or file a notice to appear against any individual ("defendant" or "violator") for certain ordinance violations may, at said staff member's discretion, in lieu thereof, issue to that individual a ticket (with a voluntary consent or request for trial form as shown on the attached Exhibit A or B) hereto (or such amended version as the chief of police, in consultation with the village attorney shall require), consistent with the provisions of this section 1-10. 
(b)  If said violation is a Type 1 offense as designated hereafter, the fine for such ordinance violations processed in this manner will be $50.00 if paid within seven days of the issuance of the ticket. Thereafter the fine will be $75.00. 
    If said violation is a Type 2 offense as designated hereafter, the fine for such ordinance violations processed in this manner will be $25.00 if paid within seven days of the issuance of the ticket. Thereafter the fine will be $50.00. 
    If said violation is a Type 3 offense as designated hereafter, the fine for such ordinance violations processed in this manner will be $25.00. 
    If said violation is a Type 4 offense as designated hereafter, the fine shall be determined by future ordinance amendment. 
    If said violation is a Type 5 offense as designated hereafter, the fine for such ordinance violations processed in this manner will be as specified in subsection 1-10(f)(5) below. 
    Each day of any such violation shall constitute a separate offense. 
(c)  Process and payments: Failure to comply with the process specified in this section 1-10 shall entitle the police department or building department staff to convert the processing of said violation to the penalties specified in section 1-8 of this Code of Ordinances, and shall thereafter be prosecuted by the village attorney, in the circuit court, or such other venue as is applicable, in accordance with Illinois law. 
    The officer issuing said ticket may in his or her discretion request immediate payment of the initial fine. In such cases, if the officer requests immediate payment and the violator agrees to make payment, the officer shall have the violator execute a voluntary consent to administrative settlement as shown on the attached Exhibit A hereto (Exhibit A is on file with the city) which, by execution by the defendant, shall waive his/her rights and authorize the village to apply said payment to the fines assessed herein and close said case without further action. Said amounts shall be deposited into village accounts and used in accordance with village policies and practices regarding voluntary payments of fines to the village. 
    If the violator refuses to sign said voluntary statement the officer may 1) instead issue a ticket in accordance with section 1-8 of this Code, or 2) request a voluntary payment of the Illinois statutory amount of said bond amount (rather than the above schedule of fines), and place said bond funds in a segregated account pending further action required herein, 3) waive immediate payment and issue the ticket without requiring a payment. 
(d)  Further action: If the officer requests payment and payment is received (but no voluntary consent is executed by the violator), the police department shall deposit said amounts in a segregated account. If during the next 30 days a voluntary consent is executed by the violator consenting to administrative settlement of the case and sent to the police department, the police department shall apply the amount of said fine against the amount of said bond and transfer said fine amount into the general accounts of the village per subsection 1-10(c) above. To the extent of any over payment, the village shall refund any overpayments to the violator. If after 30 days, no voluntary consent is received, the officer shall convert said ticket pursuant to section 1-8 and transmit said bond amount to the circuit clerk's office in accordance with established procedures. 
(e)  Failure to pay: If after issuance of a ticket pursuant to this section a defendant, refuses payment, the police department may 1) convert said ticket pursuant to section 1-8 hereof, or 2) if the defendant is a village resident, the officer shall also issue the defendant a "Notice of Violation and Request for Trial" as shown on the attached Exhibit B hereto (Exhibit B is on file with the city). Pursuant to said form, if a resident defendant disagrees with the officers conclusion that the defendant violated the ordinances of the village, the resident defendant shall deliver to the village an executed notice of violation and request for trial from requesting a trial. If the resident defendant executes and delivers the request for trial, the village shall thereafter convert the ticket pursuant to section 1-8 hereof and send the resident defendant a notice to appear in court (to allow for a trial pursuant to court rules). If the resident defendant fails to deliver such a request for trial within 30 days after issuance, the resident defendant shall be conclusively deemed to have violated the section of the ordinances specified in the notice and the village shall impose the amount of said fine against the resident defendant's village services account pursuant to section 2-10 of the Village Code.

Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this article. The primary purpose is the preventing of a concentration or locating of these uses in any area which would create such adverse effects.

    Adult theater: An enclosed building or an enclosed space within a building which is used for presenting video or audio (regardless of format) materials distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas for observation by patrons therein (whether actual or simulated, e.g., animated videos, actual videos, etc.). Sexually explicit material and materials displaying specified anatomical areas and/or specified sexual activities (whether actual or simulated, e.g., comic books, animated videos, etc.) shall not be sold or rented at an adult theater. 
    Other adult definitions: 
    Specified anatomical areas: The following are considered to be a sexual anatomical area or genital area: genitals, pubic area, anus, or perineum of any person, or the vulva or breasts of a female.

Sec. 21/2-16. - Location restriction. 
    No regulated use shall be permitted to operate on a parcel of land of which any portion of that parcel falls within 300 feet of the right-of-way line of Route 30, Route 31, and Orchard Road. 
    The structure in which is located any regulated use hereunder shall be located at least 1,100 feet from the nearest property line of any land in any residential zone, or of any public, private or parochial school, park, playground, or church, convent, monastery, synagogue or similar place of worship, in any other zone.

ARTICLE V. - PRAIRIE GRASSES CONTROL[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 872, §§ 2-5, adopted Oct. 25, 1999, enacted provisions which pertained to control of prairie grasses. Such ordinance did not specify manner of codification; hence, inclusion herein as Art. V, §§ 9-111-9-117 was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 9-111. - Prairie grass permits. 
    Prairie grass permits. 
(1)  Permit required: Notwithstanding any village ordinance to the contrary, prairie grasses as herein defined shall be permitted and not considered a weed for village ordinance purposes, if such grasses are maintained in conformance with this article. However, prairie grasses grown and maintained on more than one percent, in aggregate, of a lot, tract or parcel of land within the village not covered by a structure or structures shall be permitted only if a permit has been applied for and received from the village. Prairie grasses grown and maintained on one percent or less, in aggregate, of a lot, tract or parcel of land within the village not covered by a structure or structures shall be allowed without a permit. If prairie grasses are intermingled with other vegetation so as to make it impractical to measure for determining if the percentage is more or less than one percent, the entire bed or area of mixed vegetation shall be deemed to be prairie grasses for the purpose of the calculation. 
(2)  Definitions: For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply: 
a.  Structure shall be defined as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Montgomery and consistent therewith, driveways and sidewalks are deemed not to be structures. 
b.  Prairie grasses shall mean plants and vegetation in the commonly accepted publications describing prairie grasses, including but not limited to the publications entitled, "Plants of the Chicago Region," by Floyd Swink and Gerould Wilhelm (1974), "Wildflowers of the Tallgrass Prairie, the Upper Midwest," by Sylvan T. Runkel and Dean M. Roosa (1989), and "Field Guide to North American Wildflowers, Eastern Region," by The Audubon Society (1979), "Native Illinois Herbs and Flora," by Illinois Department of Conservation, copies of which are on file and available for public inspection at the Village Hall of the Village of Montgomery. 
(3)  Setback: All prairie grasses shall have a mandatory setback of not less than 25 feet from any front, rear or side lot line. 
(4)  Application for permit: A person shall apply for such a permit by submitting to the village: a completed application supplied by the Village, and a site plan drawn to scale or dimensioned on sheets of paper no smaller than 81/2 × 11 inches and no larger than 24 × 36 inches which contain the location of property lines, location of plant materials, list of plant materials (common names), north arrow, location of structures and paved areas, distances of plant materials from property lines. The village staff shall review the application and site plan and issue a permit if it determines, in its sole discretion that the plan is consistent with surrounding land owners uses of property and a nuisance will not arise from the implementation of the plan. The applicant may appeal the denial of a permit to the village board. 
(5)  Compliance with permitted plan; revocation of permit: If, at any time, the implementation of a permitted plan exceeds that planting shown on the plan or if other weeds, plants or grass are allowed to grow to a height exceeding that allowed by the village weed ordinance, it shall be and is hereby deemed a nuisance and the permit shall automatically be revoked. Such a nuisance shall be a violation of this article. 
(6)  Term of permit: Any permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall be valid for five years at which time it must be renewed and a new permit fee paid. The permit may be terminated sooner pursuant to subsection (5) above. 
(7)  Annual cutting: It shall be a requirement of this section and a condition of the permit that the person to whom it is issued shall mow, cut or burn (in conformance with all other applicable regulations) the prairie grasses to the height set forth for other weeds, plants or grass in other village ordinances no less than once every 12 months. 
(8)  Maintenance of lot: It shall be a requirement of this article and a condition of the permit that the lot owner shall prevent encroachment of weeds, plants, grass and prairie grasses into a contiguous lot, tract or parcel of land, and shall be responsible for the maintenance of the weeds, plants, grass, prairie grasses without entering upon said contiguous lot, tract or parcel of land. 
(9)  Permit fee: The fee for a prairie grass permit shall be $75.00 and shall be paid upon application for the permit. 
(Ord. No. 872, § 2, 10-25-99) 
Sec. 9-112. - Control. 
    All prairie grass requiring permits pursuant to the provisions above, which are grown or maintained without permits, or weeds, plants or grass shall be cut, pulled, plowed under or otherwise destroyed as necessary so as to comply with the provisions of this article and the village shall be under no obligation to provide prior notice of violation to any party in violation of any section hereof. 
(Ord. No. 872, § 3, 10-25-99) 
Sec. 9-113. - Abatement. 
(a)  The village shall have the right to abate by cutting, pulling, plowing under, chemically spraying or otherwise destroying any existing prairie grasses grown or maintained without permits, and which violate the provisions of this article.

    All costs incurred by the village for abatement, pursuant to this article, shall be a lien upon the property as provided in Chapter 65, Act 5, Sections 11-20-6 and 11-20-7, of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. This cost shall be a lien upon the real estate, affected superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided, that within 60 days after such cost or expense is incurred, the village or person performing on behalf of the village, in his or its own name files a notice of lien in the office of the Kane or Kendall County Recorder of Deeds. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out (1) a description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof; (2) the amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred or payable for the service; and (3) the date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by the village. However, such lien shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of such notice. Upon payment of the cost and expense (including costs and expenses of releasing the lien) by the owner of or persons interested in such property after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the village or person in whose name the lien has been filed and the release may be filed of record as in the case of filing notice of lien. 
    The cost of the cutting shall not be a lien on the real estate affected unless a notice is personally served on, or sent by certified mail to, the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the general taxes on the property for the last preceding year. The notice shall be delivered or sent after the cutting of weeds on the property. The notice shall state the substance of this section and shall identify the property, by common description, and the location of the weeds to be cut. 
(Ord. No. 872, § 5, 10-25-99) 
Sec. 9-115. - Foreclosure of lien. 
    Property subject to a lien for unpaid cutting charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as in the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in the name of the village. 
    The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings, in the name of the village, in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which a bill for weed cutting has remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered. 
(Ord. No. 872, § 5, 10-25-99) 
Sec. 9-116. - Exemption. 
    The provisions of this article requiring a prairie grass permit shall not be applicable with respect to any premises or lands that are classified for legal nonconforming farm or agricultural use, or lands owned by the State of Illinois or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision thereof. 
(Ord. No. 872, § 5, 10-25-99) 
Sec. 9-117. - Penalty.

(Ord. No. 1123, § 1, 5-24-04) 
Sec. 91/2-5. - Landmark designations-Procedures and standards. 
(a)  Procedure: 
(1)  Any person, group of persons or association, or the historic preservation commission (hereinafter referred to as the commission) on its own initiative, may propose landmark designation for any improvement or site which is located within the corporate limits of the village and which may have historic significance as set forth in the criteria for evaluation. The application for landmark designation shall be in writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. Forms required for landmark designation shall be supplied by the director of community development, upon request. 
Any structure already on the national register of historic sites shall be a designated landmark, subject to a public hearing. 
(2)  The application for landmark designation shall be filed with the director of community development. Within five working days of filing, the director of community development shall transmit the application to the commission for review and public hearing. 
(3)  Within 30 days after filing of the application for landmark designation, the commission shall contact the property owner (if the application was made by a party other than the property owner) to provide a copy of the application for landmark designation and request a response from the owner in writing as to whether or not the property owner consents or objects to such a designation. 
(4)  Within 60 days after filing of the application for landmark designation, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the question of proposed landmark designation. 
(5)  Prior to the public hearing on the application for landmark designation, the commission shall review the application and any additional information on the improvement or site proposed for landmark designation and make a report containing preliminary findings on the historic, architectural and aesthetic significance of the improvement. 
(6)  Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the village, not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days in advance of the date of the hearing. The notice shall identify the applicant, property owners, property affected and shall describe the proposed amendment. 
The applicant shall provide a list to the director of community development, along with addressed envelopes with return receipts (certified mail), of the owner of the subject property and the owners of record of all properties situated either 250 feet (excluding rights-of-way) from the property that is the subject of the public hearing or two lots deep, whichever is the greater distance, and the director of community development shall mail to said owners a written notice of the public hearing not less than ten days prior to the hearing. 
The director of community development shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this section. Failure to comply with any of the notice provisions, except for the publishing of the legal notice in the newspaper and the notice to the owner of the subject property, shall not render any amendment invalid. 
(7)  The public hearing shall be conducted by the commission and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. 
(8)  The commission shall make written findings of fact and shall submit same, together with its recommendations, to the village board within 15 days of the date of the public hearing. Applications for a local landmark which do not have property owner consent shall require a supermajority vote of the commission to recommend approval of the designation of landmark. A supermajority shall be defined as three-quarters of the commission members. 
(9)  Within 120 days of the filing of the application, the village board shall grant or deny the application for landmark designation. If the village board approves the application for landmark designation, a notice of the designation will be sent by the village clerk to the applicant and the owner of the improvement and a copy of the ordinance effectuating the designation shall be recorded with the appropriate county recorder of deeds and with the appropriate township assessor. 
Applications for a local landmark which do not have property owner consent shall require a supermajority vote of the village board to approve the designation of landmark. A supermajority shall be defined as three-quarters of the village board members. 
(10)  The person, group of persons or association submitting the application for landmark designation, excluding the commission when acting on its own initiative, shall bear all costs of and pay all fees required in connection with said application. All fees shall be set by ordinance enacted by the village board. 
(11)  During the period beginning with the filing of an application for landmark designation and ending with the final action of the village board granting or denying said application, no exterior architectural feature of any improvement or any site which is the subject of an application for landmark designation may undergo alteration, construction, demolition or removal if such alteration, construction, demolition or removal would be subject to the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness after designation. Nothing in this subsection shall operate to bar ordinary repair and maintenance or any work that is necessary to prevent or correct an imminently dangerous or hazardous condition. 
(12)  Landmarks shall be designated by ordinance. Once an improvement has been designated as a landmark, no exterior architectural feature of said designated landmark may undergo alteration, construction, demolition or removal if such alteration, construction, demolition or removal would be subject to the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness under the provision of the chapter. Nothing in this subsection shall operate to bar ordinary repair and maintenance or any work that is necessary to prevent or correct imminently dangerous or hazardous condition. 
(13)  In the event that an application for landmark designation is denied by the village board, or the application is withdrawn after the public hearing, no application for landmark designation of the same improvement shall be made within 12 months of the date of the denial or withdrawal. 
(b)  Standards for designation of landmarks: The commission shall not recommend nor the village board grant a designation of a landmark unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that the proposed landmark meets the following requirements: 
(1)  That it is located within the corporate boundaries of the village; and 
(2)  That one or more of the following conditions exists: 
a.  That it is associated with an important person or with important events in national, state or local history; 
b.  That it is representative of the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type inherently valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction or use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; 
c.  That it is associated with the notable work of a master builder, designer, architect or artist whose individual genius influenced an era; 
d.  That it possesses significant value as part of the historical, cultural, artistic, social, ethnic or other heritage of the nation, state, county or community; 
e.  That the proposed landmark is of historic, architectural, or cultural significance which is threatened with demolition by public or private action; 
f.  That the proposed landmark's unique location or singular physical characteristics makes it an established or familiar visual feature in the community; and 
(4)  That it possesses integrity of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location and/or association; and 
(5)  That it embodies such other qualities and characteristics as in the judgment of the commission should be considered for the designation of a landmark. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1, 11-28-05; Ord. No. 1325, § 1, 7-23-07)

f.  Installing, removing or changing landscaping. 
g.  Modifications, alterations and maintenance of the interior of the building. 
(3)  The above list notwithstanding, if the landmark was nominated and designated as such based on the architectural, historical, cultural and/or archeological significance of any of the above mentioned features, then the proposed work affecting said feature will require a certificate of appropriateness. 
(c)  Process for issuing a certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a building, demolition, or sign permit as required under the provision of this code for any improvement of any site or building designated as a landmark, the building department shall forward such application to the director of community development. 
(2)  Within seven days, the director of community development shall determine whether the proposed activity requires a certificate of appropriateness as required by this chapter, and if a certificate of appropriateness is required, shall (1) forward the application to the commission and (2) notify the person in charge of said property that such plans will be reviewed by the commission subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Within 30 days of receipt of said plan or drawing, the commission shall hold a public meeting and provide the person in charge of the property and the director of community development with a written determination as to the appropriateness of the design, materials, and exterior features of the proposed building or sign. No determination shall be made unless a quorum of the commission has visited the site. 
(4)  The commission's determination of appropriateness shall be in writing and shall include findings of fact in support thereof. Such determination may be an approval, modification or disapproval of the applicant's request. The director of community development shall forward copies of the determination to the applicant and the owner of the subject property. Such determinations by the commission shall be binding except as provided in subsection (c)(5) of this section. 
(5)  The commission may not make any determination which conflicts with the provisions of the subdivision regulations or the village zoning ordinance. 
(6)  If the commission fails to grant approval of the applicant's request, or if the applicant objects to the commission's determination, then the applicant may request, in writing, to the director of community development that an appeal of the commission's decision be made to the village board. Both the applicant and the commission have the right to be heard at the appeal. 
(7)  Within 45 days after such an appeal is made, the village board shall, by resolution, affirm or reverse the commission's determination according to the applicable standards set forth in this chapter. In accordance with said standards, the village board may also modify the commission's determination. A reversal or modification of the commission's determination shall be approved by a vote of two-thirds of the village board. Following the decision by the village board, the director of community development shall notify the applicant and the commission in writing regarding the board's decision. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1, 11-28-05) 
Sec. 91/2-7. - Same-Fees, enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  The village board, by separate resolution, may establish an appropriate system of processing fees for the review of landmark nominations and certificates of appropriateness. 
(b)  Any person who undertakes or causes an alteration, construction, demolition, or removal of any nominated or designated landmark without a valid certificate of appropriateness shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $750.00. Every day such violation shall continue to exist shall constitute a separate violation. The village manager may institute any appropriate action or proceeding in the name of the Village of Montgomery to enjoin, correct or abate any violation of sections 91/2-5-91/2-7.

A personal motor vehicle used to transport junk/scrap belonging to the owner of that vehicle, which owner is not in the business of junk/scrap collection, or family members, friends or neighbors of the vehicle owner, to a junk/scrap yard is not considered to be a junk/scrap collection vehicle, and does not need to be licensed as such. 
    Junk/scrap. Manufactured articles or parts that have been discarded and are useful only as material for reprocessing or recycling. Junk, trash and refuse are further defined herein to include any and all waste matter, whether reusable or not, which is offensive to the public health, safety or to the esthetics of the neighborhood, and is specifically intended to include, but not be limited to, worn out, wrecked or abandoned automobiles, trucks, tractors, machinery of any kind, any parts thereof, old iceboxes, refrigerators, and stoves.

However, persons selling personal property belonging to them or family members on a temporary basis from their own residential property in the form of a "garage sale" or "yard sale" shall not be considered to be a secondhand dealer under this chapter, do not need a secondhand dealer's license to engage in such activity, and are exempt from the reporting requirements otherwise required by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-112. - Exemptions. 
    Except for sections 10-139 and 10-140, this chapter shall not apply to the purchase or sale of used motor vehicles, including motorcycles and motor driven cycles, as defined in the Illinois Vehicle Code, nor shall it apply to businesses or charitable organizations that accept donated goods for resale, nor shall it apply to the sale or purchase of aluminum cans.

    The police department shall enter into a contract for service and maintain its contract for service with LeadsOnline, or a similar entity as designated by the chief of police, in order to enhance its investigative services to protect both pawnbrokers/secondhand dealers and members of the general public. In the event of a change to its electronic reporting system, the village will notify all impacted licensees of the change within a reasonable time prior to such change. 
    Every pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall operate and maintain a computer system with internet access and photographic or video capability sufficient for the electronic reporting requirements described in this chapter. Any failure or malfunction of such equipment on the part of the licensee shall not exempt the licensee from the recording/reporting requirements outlined in section 10-114 of this chapter. The licensee shall immediately notify the police department of any such failure or malfunction, and shall have such resolved as soon as practicable. Failure by the licensee to resolve any failure or malfunction of equipment in a reasonable amount of time will lead to license revocation proceedings under section 10-138 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-114. - Record of transactions. 
    Throughout the term of the license, every pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall report/upload to LeadsOnline, or the village's current electronic reporting system, the below listed information for each and every transaction conducted during each day they were open for business by the end of that business day. All information shall be recorded in the English language. 
    A transaction shall consist of all articles brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn by an individual (pawner/seller) at the same time and date, and includes the sale of nonjunk/scrap articles by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to another person. Nonjunk/scrap articles purchased by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer from another business shall not be considered to be transactions for the purposes of this section, and are exempt from the reporting requirements of this section, and are also exempt from the waiting period established under section 10-118. Articles brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn at different times on the same date by the same person shall be considered as separate transactions, regardless of how short the difference in time is between those transactions. Separate transactions, either from the same person or different persons, shall not be combined and reported collectively. 
(1)  Nonjunk/scrap articles other than coins and paper money. 
a.  Purchases/receipts by licensees. 
1.  Reserved. 
2.  All such articles sold, bartered, traded, pledged or pawned to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article(s) in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
b.  A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
c.  Reserved. 
d.  The date and time of the transaction. 
3.  Descriptions/photographs of articles. 
a.  Individually identifiable articles: 
i.  Each individually identifiable nonjunk/scrap article brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction shall be itemized separately. Licensees shall not lump such articles together (e.g., "five gold monogrammed rings"), but must provide a complete and thorough description of each item to include the following: 
a.  Type of article. 
b.  Brand name/make/manufacturer (if applicable). 
c.  Model number (if applicable). 
d.  Serial number (if applicable). 
e.  Color/finish. 
f.  Any other identifying marks, writing, engraving, etc. 
ii.  A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each individually identifiable article, sufficiently detailed to allow reasonable identification of the article. The digital photograph(s) shall capture any identifying numbers, marks, writing, engraving, etc., or any other distinguishing characteristics. 
b.  Nonindividually identifiable articles: 
i.  Articles that cannot be distinguished from any other similar articles may be described in groups of similar types of articles, but only within the same transaction made by the same seller/pawner. Licensees shall provide reasonable descriptions of the number and types of items within each group to enable the police department to determine if they may have been stolen during a particular crime. Example: an individual pawner/seller brings in a video game controller, five video game discs, and numerous items of jewelry. The licensee would first of all have to individually itemize and photograph the video game controller as outlined in "individually identifiable articles" above, as it would be a serially-numbered item. As for the remaining items, the licensee shall not list them as "miscellaneous video games and jewelry." Instead, the licensee shall describe them as follows: "five video game discs to include the following titles...." and "miscellaneous jewelry to include two yellow gold necklaces, one silver necklace, two pairs of silver earrings, one women's yellow gold ring, one women's white gold diamond ring and two silver bracelets." 
ii.  A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each group of similar types of articles within each transaction made by the same seller/pawner. The articles may be photographed together as a group, but each individual article shall be visible in the photograph. For example, given the circumstances outlined in subparagraph "a" above, the five video game discs would be photographed together as a group side-by-side (not stacked on top of each other), and the jewelry items would be photographed together as a group with each item laid out so as to be individually viewable (not piled together in a heap). 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  In order to facilitate the return of stolen items to their rightful owners, individually identifiable nonjunk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual shall be reported to LeadsOnline. Licensees shall individually itemize and describe each individually identifiable article so sold. 
2.  Each individually identifiable nonjunk/scrap article sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be associated with the person to whom it was sold. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name and current address of the purchaser must be recorded/reported-A photographic image of a government-issued photo ID card is not necessary. 
b.  A digital photograph of nonjunk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual is not required. 
3.  As there is no lawful basis for confiscating and returning property to the victim of a crime that cannot be individually identified as having been stolen from the victim, reporting the sale of nonindividually identifiable articles by a licensee to LeadsOnline is not required. 
(2)  Junk/scrap articles. 
a.  Purchases by licensees. 
1.  Junk/scrap articles may be recorded/reported in bulk, but must specify the weight, type (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum, etc.) and form (e.g. sheet, pipe, wire, etc.) of the bulk material. 
2.  Each different type and form of junk/scrap bulk material brought in to a secondhand dealer by an individual for sale during a transaction shall be associated with the person who brought the material in. Licensees shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
b.  A photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
c.  If the seller is selling on behalf of a company or business, the name, address, and telephone number of such company or business shall also be recorded/reported. 
d.  If the junk/scrap is brought by motor vehicle to a licensee for sale, the make, model, color, and license plate number of that vehicle shall be recorded/reported. 
e.  The date and time of the transaction. 
f.  A digital photograph or, if the licensee has a video system, video segment of each individual type and form of bulk material purchased by the licensee shall be linked to the record of that transaction. 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of junk/scrap material. 
2.  Reserved. 
(3)  Coins and paper money. 
a.  Purchases/receipts by licensees. 
1.  Coins have no distinguishing characteristics that separate them from other coins of the same mintage, and although paper money is serial numbered, those serial numbers are so seldom known by their last possessor that paper money is effectively indistinguishable from other paper money of the same denomination. Furthermore, unlike coins made of precious metals, paper money seldom carries any value significantly beyond the face value of the bill, and when stolen is usually used directly as cash and not sold to a currency dealer. Accordingly, coins or paper money brought in by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction do not need to be itemized individually, but rather may be recorded/reported in bulk. 
2.  Coins or paper money brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
b.  A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
c.  The date and time of the transaction. 
d.  The quantities and types of coins or paper money present. If coins are all of the same type, they shall be reported by either quantity or weight, and type (e.g., five Morgan silver dollars, 25 buffalo nickels, five pounds of wheat pennies, etc.). If coins are from a collection, a description of the theme of the collection (e.g., Bicentennial coins, state quarters, etc.) along with the number of coins shall be provided. If coins represent an accumulation of disparate coins with no overall theme, a generic description of the type and quantity of coins shall be provided (e.g., approximately 200 U.S. coins of miscellaneous dates and denominations, approximately 100 foreign coins from various countries, etc.). Paper money shall be reported by quantity and type (e.g., 25 U.S. $5 silver certificates, etc.). 
3.  As a photograph of coins or paper money conveys no more information than can be obtained from the written descriptions required by subsection (3)a.2.d. of this section, no photographs of coins or paper money are required. 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of coins or paper money to other individuals or businesses. 
    In the event the electronic reporting system malfunctions or is otherwise not operational, the licensee shall, at all times during such malfunction or nonoperation, be required to keep written records of any and all transactions made during the period of malfunction or nonoperation, to include all information required by this section. These written records shall be reported/uploaded to LeadsOnline, or the village's current electronic reporting system, as soon as practicable after the electronic reporting system is functional. No such written records shall be erased, mutilated or changed. Written records shall be open and available for review upon request by the village staff or any peace officer during regular business hours.

Sec. 10-115. - Pawnbrokers: Issuance of signed receipt. 
    Every pawnbroker shall, at the time of making any advancement or loan, deliver to the person pawning or pledging any property a receipt signed by him containing an accurate account and description, in the English language, of all the goods, articles or other things pawned or pledged, the amount of money, value or thing loaned thereon, the time of pledging the same, the rate of interest to be paid on such loan and the name and residence of the person making the pawn or pledge. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-116. - Pawnbrokers: Employment of persons under sixteen. 
    No pawnbroker shall permit any person under the age of 16 years to take pledges in pawn for him. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-117. - Secondhand dealer not to act as a pawnbroker. 
    No secondhand dealer shall receive any article or thing by way of pledge or pawn, nor shall he loan or advance any sum of money on the security of any article or thing, unless he also happens to be separately licensed as a pawnbroker under this chapter, and complies with the specific requirements of sections 10-115 and 10-116 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-118. - Waiting periods. 
    No articles received on deposit or pledge by any pawnbroker, shall be permitted to be redeemed or removed from the place of business of such pawnbroker for the space of 48 hours after the delivery of the signed receipt required by section 10-115. No articles pawned or pledged shall be sold or disposed of by any pawnbroker within one year from the time the pawner or pledger shall make default in the payment of interest on the money so advanced by the pawnbroker, unless by the written consent of the pawner or pledger. 
    No pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall expose for sale, or sell, trade or barter, or melt, crush/compact, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, any nonscrap/junk article that is individually identifiable within 30 days of the time of purchasing or receiving the same, nor until the same has been in or upon the premises where the same are offered, exposed, traded, bartered or sold, at least 30 days, unless the article consists primarily of precious metal(s). Due to fluctuations in the prices of precious metals and security concerns emanating from the accumulation of large quantities of precious metals, there shall be no waiting period for such articles, even if they are individually identifiable. 
    There shall be no waiting period for scrap/junk, coins, paper money or other nonindividually identifiable articles. 
(Ord. No. 1567, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 10-119. - Prohibited transactions. 
    No pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, in the course of conducting his business, shall receive any articles for pawn, pledge, advancement of money, loan, resale, or personal use from:

If an administrative penalty is to be imposed, the penalty shall be paid directly to the village, and payment shall be made at the village police department.

(c)  Notice. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the village. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle and of owner's right to request an administrative hearing, as provided for in subsection (d). Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the administrative hearing, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 and pays the towing and storage charges. 
(d)  Preliminary and full hearing. The police chief shall designate from time to time a person within the police department as a preliminary hearing officer. Within 24 hours of any vehicle being seized and impounded pursuant to this section, if requested by any owner of record, lessee, or any lienholder of record, the police department shall conduct a preliminary hearing at which time said owner of record, lessee, or any lienholder of record may present any evidence said person desires which would demonstrate a defense to said seizure and impoundment. If the police department determines that said evidence supports such a defense, the police department may release said vehicle without further process. If the police department determines that said evidence does not support such a defense, then the police department shall deny said preliminary hearing and proceed as outlined in the remainder of this section. 
Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record, lessee, and any lienholder of record at the address which the interested party is registered with the Secretary of State, of the date, time, and location of the administrative hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this section. The initial administrative hearing shall be scheduled for not more than 45 days after the date the above notice is mailed. Notice by certified mail need not be given when the owner of record of the motor vehicle, any lessee and any lien holder of record have been personally served with notice, in written form, of the time, date and location of the hearing. The owner of record, any lessee, and any lienholder of record shall appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner of record, any lessee or any lienholder or record pleads not guilty, a final hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 45 days after the initial administrative hearing. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably-prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. After the hearing, the hearing officers shall issue a written decision either sustaining or overruling the vehicle impoundment. If the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in this section, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $500.00 and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the village (or to the towing firm) plus fees to the towing firm for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record, any lessee and any lienholder of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees. 
(e)  Administrative penalty. If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this section which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Law may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the village and any applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing firm, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the vehicle is not retrieved within 35 days after an administrative hearing officer issues a written decision, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles, as set forth in Article II, Chapter 4 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(f)  Vehicle possession. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle is the record title holder as registered with the secretary of state, State of Illinois. 
(g)  General regulations. 
(1)  This section shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing state or federal laws or village ordinance pertaining to vehicle seizure and impoundment, and these penalties shall be in addition to any penalties that may be assessed by a court for any criminal charges. 
(2)  This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered. 
(3)  Fees for towing and storage of a vehicle under this section shall be those approved by the chief of police for all towers authorized to tow for the police department.

The applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage, and construction shall be accomplished in strict conformance with the drainage plan. The following information shall be submitted for both existing and proposed property conditions. 
    Drainage plan 
(1)  Topographic map: A topographic survey of the property at one-foot contours under existing and proposed conditions, and areas upstream and downstream, necessary to determine off-site impacts of the proposed drainage plan. The map shall be keyed to a consistent datum specified by the village.

(Ord. No. 815, § 400, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-4. - Minimization of increases in runoff volumes and rates. 
    In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement, where practicable, and as directed by the village board, planning commission or village engineer, site design features which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which are consisted with the following hierarchy: 
(1)  Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the needs of the project; 
(2)  Attenuate flows by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions and preserve existing natural stream channels; 
(3)  Infiltrate runoff on-site; 
(4)  Provide stormwater retention structures; 
(5)  Provide stormwater detention structures; and 
(6)  Construct storm sewers. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 500, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-5. - Water quality and multiple uses. 
    Stormwater system designs should be in conformance with Illinois EPA stormwater permitting requirements. In particular, a state national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit for construction site activities is required for land disturbances of five or more acres. Permit requirements for a "stormwater pollution prevention plan" specifically reference the need for stormwater detention, vegetated swales and natural depressions, infiltration measures, and velocity dissipation, vegetated swales and natural depressions, infiltration measures, and velocity dissipation devices to control runoff pollutants and to maintain pre-development hydrologic conditions. 
    The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to wet bottom and wetland designs and all flows from the development shall be routed through the basin (i.e., low flows shall not be bypassed). Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. 
    The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 600, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-6. - Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(a)  Release rates. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the two-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained. 
    The village reserves the right to require more restrictive release rates for any development within a watershed with either limited downstream conveyance or with observed historical flooding. 
(1)  Detention basin outlet design: Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
(b)  Detention storage requirements. The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and reservoir (also called modified puls or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as described in this section, for development equal to, or exceeding, five acres in size. For development less than or equal to five acres in size, use of the modified rational method in accordance with Exhibit A of this chapter shall be acceptable. 
(1)  Existing natural stormwater storage. Existing natural stormwater storage shall be maintained in accordance with subsection (i)(1). 
(2)  For purposes of this section, a single development comprised of lots each smaller than said acreage shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter and no development or parcel shall be divided into lots of a smaller dimension to circumvent the requirements herein. 
Editor's note- Exhibit A referenced above is not set out at length herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the village clerk. 
(c)  Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria should be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the five-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overland flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
(1)  Design methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to ten acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in subsection (d) must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins for development equal to, or in excess of, five acres. 
(2)  Positive drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade or exposed opening in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch. 
(d)  Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. 
The following hydrologic design procedures are considered acceptable for generation of hydrographs Corps of Engineers HEC-1 and Soil Conservation Services TR-20. 
Runoff hydrographs shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. 
(1)  Rainfall: All design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Tables 1, 3 and 4 of ISWS Circular 173. 
(2)  Antecedent moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume a conservative wet antecedent moisture condition as a minimum. (Eg., SCS TR-20 antecedent moisture condition two.) 
(e)  Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
(1)  Wet basin depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep, excluding near-shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 
(2)  Wet basin shoreline slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than five horizontal to one vertical. 
(3)  Shoreline protection: Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action. 
(4)  Permanent pool volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year event. 
(5)  Wet basin aeration: The need for wet basin aeration shall be evaluated by the village engineer on a case by case basis. 
(6)  Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(7)  Water surface area: The water surface area shall not exceed one-tenth of the tributary drainage areas. 
(8)  Maximum Depth: Maximum depth of planned stormwater storage shall not exceed five feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the village. 
(f)  Wetland and dry detention basin design: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter wetland and dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Wetland and dry basin drainage: Wetland and dry basins shall be designed so that the portion of their bottom area which is intended to be dry shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for all runoff events less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet/wetland portion of the basin bottom from the dry portion. 
Dry basins shall have a minimum bottom slope of two percent. Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall be used if the bottom slope requirement cannot be met. 
(2)  Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. 
(3)  Inlet and outlet orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. There should be no low flow bypass between the inlet and paved low flow channels shall not be used. 
(4)  Stilling/sedimentation basins: A temporary stilling/sedimentation basin should be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland or dry basin. The volume of the basins should be at least 500 cubic feet per acre of impervious surface in the drainage area. Side slopes of the basins shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical and basin depths should be at least three feet to minimize resuspension of accumulated sediment. The stilling/sedimentation basin shall remain in place until the design tributary area achieves a build-out of 80 percent. 
(5)  Maximum depth: Maximum depth of planned stormwater storage shall not exceed four feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the village. 
(g)  Minimum detention outlet size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate self-cleaning flow restrictors. 
    The orifice shall be constructed in the downstream invert of the catch basin which shall be centered in the detention basin embankment to facilitate maintenance. 
(h)  Detention in floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met. 
(1)  Detention in flood fringe areas: The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 11/2 times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(2)  Detention in floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with subsection (3), below. 
(3)  On-stream detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this chapter with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in section 163/4-7 of this chapter. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
a.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
b.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
c.  Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin. 
d.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
e.  Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall include at a minimum: runoff reduction BMPs consistent with section 163/4-4 of this chapter; two-year detention/sedimentation basins for all development consistent with subsection (i)(4); and a program to control nonpoint sources at the source for prior developments constructed without appropriate stormwater BMPs. 
f.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge, and 
g.  Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Parts 700 and 702 and the floodplain chapter of village of Montgomery. 
(i)  Protection of wetlands and depressional storage areas. Wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, the following requirements shall be met for all developments which drainage flows into wetlands and depressional storage areas (as appropriate): 
(1)  Detention in wetlands and depressional storage areas: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage. 
(2)  Sediment control: The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled. 
(3)  Alteration of drainage patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland. 
(4)  Detention/sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in section 163/4-4 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland. 
(5)  Vegetated buffer strip: A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland. 
(j)  Street, parking lot, and culvert drainage: 
(1)  Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch and shall not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event. 
(2)  Parking lots: The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed 12 inches for more than four hours. 
(3)  Culvert road and driveway crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. The minimum size for roadway culverts shall be 18 inches and shall be sized for a minimum design recurrence interval of 25 years (an event having a four percent chance of occurring in any given year). The minimum size for driveway culverts shall be 15 inches. 
(k)  Vegetated filter strips and swales: To effectively filter stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Wherever practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and swales before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin. 
(l)  Safety considerations: The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events. 
(1)  Side slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than four horizontal to one vertical. 
(2)  Safety ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet in width 21/2 to three feet below the normal water depth. 
(3)  Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow. 
(4)  Overflow structures: All stormwater detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade or exposed opening in the vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate. 
(5)  Relationship to roadways: All stormwater detention basins shall conform to section 9-115.1 of the Illinois Highway Code. 
(m)  Maintenance considerations: The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be designed to allow lawnmowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 700, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-7. - Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. 
    Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system. 
(1)  Upstream areas not meeting chapter requirements. When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed: 
a.  The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the release rates of section 163/4-5, the applicant's property area, and the procedures described in section 163/4-6. 
b.  Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, shall be identified. 
c.  Using the areas determined in 801.b. above plus the applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed. 
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in section 163/4-6. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purposes of computing storage. 
Once the necessary combined storage is computed the village may choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage for his property as computed in subsection a above and as provided in section 163/4-6(b) and (b)(1). If regional storage is selected by the village, then the design produced in subsection c above shall be implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the village, the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin, a multi-staged outlet structure should be designed such that on-site peak flows are attenuated. Detention basin routing schemes should be reviewed and approved by the village or their consultant prior to final design. The applicant may be required to route off-site flows through the basin if in the opinion of the village engineer it is warranted. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the provisions of section 163/4-6(h)(3) for on-stream basins. 
(2)  Upstream areas meeting chapter requirements. When there are areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the applicant's detention basin, or be routed through the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the applicant's property shall still be computed as described in subsection (1)a of this section. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 800, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-8. - Early completion of detention facilities. 
    Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 900, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-9. - Maintenance responsibility. 
    Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before a building permit for a single lot development or subdivision approval is obtained from the Village of Montgomery, the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the Village of Montgomery guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the village to enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections and maintenance of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds of Kane and Kendall Counties. The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the Village of Montgomery. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the authorized official of the Village of Montgomery notifies the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within 30 calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period the village may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner. 
    The Village of Montgomery has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater drainage system. 
    The following summarizes the funding and maintenance responsibility for developments in the Village of Montgomery.

Sec. 163/4-10. - Administration. 
(a)  Inspections. 
(1)  Inspections during construction of drainage system: General site grading shall not begin until the village has certified in writing to the applicant that any necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The village or their authorized representative will also conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system is being built as designed. If any violations of the provisions or requirements of this chapter are noted during such inspections, the village shall notify the property owner in writing of the items needing correction. The property owner shall have ten calendar days to make such corrections unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the village. 
Failure to complete such corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(2)  Final inspection of drainage system: Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage system is completed, the village or their authorized representative shall conduct a final inspection. If the drainage system is found to contain deficiencies which require correction the village or their authorized representative shall notify the property owner of the necessary corrections. The property owner shall correct such deficiencies within ten calendar days unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the village. Failure to make necessary corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Upon finding that the drainage system meets the provisions and requirements of this chapter the village shall issue in writing a notice of drainage system completion to the property owner. 
(3)  Routine inspections: All privately owned drainage systems shall be inspected by representatives of the village not less often than once per year. A written report shall be filed of the results of any inspection and a copy sent to the property owner detailing any problems which need correction. 
(b)  Enforcement. The administration and enforcement of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the Village of Montgomery or their authorized representatives. 
(c)  Appeals. Any applicant may appeal any decision of the village engineer to the village board of trustees, provided that no such appeal shall be taken until and unless the applicant has requested a conference with the village engineer, not a subordinate of the village engineer, and either the conference has been held or the village engineer has not scheduled a conference. 
(d)  Conferences. At any time an applicant may ask for a conference with the village engineer concerning any application under this chapter, and the village engineer will meet with the applicant to discuss the matter. If an applicant has been dealing with any person working under the supervision of the village engineer, at the applicant's request the village engineer and not a subordinate will hold a conference with the applicant. 
(e)  Fees. Engineering review, legal and construction observation fees are the responsibility of the applicant. 
    A cash deposit of $500.00 is required prior to the initiation of review and will be subject to adjustment after the initial review. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 1100, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-11. - Compliance with local park district ordinances. 
    Any drainage plan presented by a developer who wishes to utilize certain land areas for the combined use as park district open space and surface stormwater drainage facilities shall be demonstrated to the Village of Montgomery by the developer to be in compliance with all park district ordinances with respect to development of these areas. 
(Ord. No. 815, § 1200, 5-11-98) 
Sec. 163/4-12. - Penalties. 
    Any person convicted of violating any of the provisions or requirements of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500.00. Each day the violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

(b)  Other utilities. Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this article.

(b)  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(2)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(3)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or 
(4)  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.

(d)  Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the village director of public works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.

(b)  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
(1)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available; 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the village director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately; 
(3)  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.

(b)  Authority to grant variances. The village director of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis.

(1)  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the village director of public works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village director of public works under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate.

Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

(3)  After the village has provided for the abatement of the nuisance, the enforcement personnel shall ensure that a notice is sent via personal delivery or certified mail to the person to whom the tax bill for general taxes on the property for the last preceding year was mailed (hereafter, "taxpayer of record"), along with a copy of this section, a description of the nuisance condition, the date on which the nuisance was abated, and the cost of abatement. Said enforcement personnel shall thereafter, within 60 days of the abatement, take such steps as shall be necessary to record a sworn statement of lien against the affected property including such information as shall be required under the provisions of 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7 or any successor Illinois statute providing for the cutting, trimming or removal of weeds, grass, trees and bushes. A copy of said notice of lien shall also be mailed to the taxpayer of record. 
(4)  In the event any single property has a recurring nuisance condition occurring within a single calendar year which has not been addressed by the owner/occupier (e.g. an ongoing failure to cut grass/weeds), the enforcement personnel shall not be required to take those steps described in subsection (b)(i) above, and may proceed immediately to abatement of the nuisance, on the second or any subsequent occurrences of the nuisance. 
(c)  Foreclosure of liens. Property subject to a lien for unpaid cutting charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as in the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings, in the name of the village, in any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which a bill for weed cutting has remained unpaid 60 days after it has been rendered. 
(d)  Ordinance violations. The occurrence of a nuisance as described above shall be a violation of the Village Code of Ordinances. Action taken by the enforcement personnel to abate the nuisance shall not supersede Village Code and the occurrence of a nuisance condition is subject to a fine of not more than $100.00 per day for each day the nuisance is permitted to remain in place. Each subsequent recurrence of a nuisance condition shall be a separate violation of this Code.

    Owners or consumers desiring to discontinue the use of water shall give notice thereof to the village. Thereafter, the public works department shall then cause the water to be turned off. Base charges and maintenance fees shall be continued to be charged notwithstanding such voluntary shut off. When water service is discontinued, all water rentals for such service shall at once become due and payable. When water service is again desired after having been discontinued, a charge shall be made and collected before the water shall be turned on and the service resumed. The village shall not honor this provision if, in the opinion of the village, the purpose of shutting off the water is to effectuate a self-help eviction by a landlord against a tenant contrary to the eviction process established by Illinois law.

All new residential meters shall be equipped to be read both on the meter and at a remote location on the right side of the home (as it faces toward the street) approximately two feet from the corner. A different remote location may be approved by the director of public works. The first meters, and associated equipment, for new residential dwelling units shall be provided by the public works department and paid for by the owner. The cost of such meters shall include the cost of the water meter, a remote reading device, and all cables, connectors and other devices necessary to place the meter system into operating condition, plus an administrative fee equal to ten percent of the total cost of the foregoing items. Meters shall be placed on the service pipe not to exceed two feet from the point where such pipe enters the premises. There shall be a stop and waste between the meter and the wall, and a suitable place provided for the meter so as to keep it dry and clean and readily accessible at all times to a meter reader or inspector of the water works. In buildings where the water service enters the building in a crawl space, the service line shall enter the building immediately beneath a utility area of the building and the service pipe shall extend upward to the ground floor. The meter shall be installed on the service pipe not to exceed two feet from the floor. The stop and waste shall be between the meter and floor. A gate valve shall also be placed on the pipe on the outlet side of each meter not more than three feet from the meter. A check valve shall be placed on the outlet side of the meter. After installation all meters shall be inspected by the public works department. All meters shall be sealed; and no person shall break the seal except a representative of the public works department. Any unauthorized person breaking or causing to be broken a seal or tampering with the meter shall be subject to a fine of not less than $75.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense. Permission may be given by the director of public works to break a seal for draining a pipe or for stopping leaks. 
(b)  From time to time, it is recognized that a water meter may be disconnected by an entity other than the village's public works department. In such a case, the owner of the property will be required to re-attach the meter at their own expense. This reconnection must be established in one of the following ways: 
(1)  The village will establish a reconnection and the village will perform all work necessary for installation. The fee for reconnection under this provision will be $200.00. 
(2)  The owner may hire an outside party to establish a reconnection and the village will perform an inspection only. The fee for inspection under this provision will be $50.00.

Sec. 20-46. - Responsibility for meters; inspection, testing; right of entry. 
    Owners and occupants shall be responsible for the care and protection of the meter, and the same shall be subject to inspection and test at any time by the public works department. All owners of property and occupants in charge or control of the premises must permit any duly authorized person to enter said premises for the purpose of inspection of, and to examine, test and operate meters and valves and also for the installation and removal of meters.

Sec. 20-47. - Inaccurate meters; adjusting charges. 
(a)  Water meters will be defined by this article as inaccurate and in need of repair when the variation or departures from 100 percent of accuracy shall be in excess of four percent. Whenever any meter shall be proven to be inaccurate or in need of repair, the public works department shall cause said meter to be removed, tested, recalibrated and/or replaced, the village will pay the cost and expense of such removal, repair and/or replacement for consumers. The above charges for removal, repair and replacement will be charged regardless of whether the village or the property owner or occupant ordered the removal, repair and replacement of the meter. 
(b)  In the event of a water consumer or owner of the property disputing the public works department as to the correctness of the amount to be charged him, or in the event of a consumer or owner of the property questioning the accuracy of the meter from which the date for computing said amount of charges was obtained, then the public works department shall, at the request of the consumer or owner test and examine the meter as to its accuracy. If it is found as a result of such test that the meter is accurate, the individual requesting said test will be charged the full cost of the test. If it is found as a result of such test that the meter registers a greater or less amount of water than has actually passed through it, in excess of the allowable variation of four percent, the public works department shall so adjust the error either in favor of or against the consumer or owner for the amount of water actually passed through the meter. In no case, however, where water service has been rendered for three months or a portion thereof, shall be adjusted below the minimum charge as set by this article. No deduction shall be made on account of leakage of any kind after the water has passed through the meter, nor shall charges be made for leaking from the service pipe before it has passed through the meter. 
(c)  Any reductions or additions to charges made as a result of the foregoing provisions of this section shall and must be shown on the books of record of such transactions maintained by the director of finance.

The detector check valve shall be installed in addition to any other backflow prevention device that may be required by the building or plumbing codes. If the finance department determines that an amount of water greater than 5,000 gallons has flowed through the detector check valve, then the director of public works shall determine if any unmetered water was used. The director of public works shall estimate the amount of unmetered water that is used and the amount shall be added to the amount metered and the user shall be billed for the total amount of water used at the rates set forth hereinafter. 
    One-half the tapping fee shall be charged for attaching a fire suppression sprinkler system to the public water main. No other fees in this article shall be charged for attaching to the public water main.

Although water service accounts may be kept in the name of the customer, occupant, or user served, such owner shall be recognized as the consumer. Payments will be accepted from tenants when tendered by them, but the acceptance of such payments shall not be deemed a waiver by the village of the obligation of the owner to pay any other water rents or rates or other proper water service charges when due. 
(a)  Discontinuing service: 
(1)  Delinquent charges. Water service may be shut off and discontinued to any property in which an owner/customer, occupant or user has allowed billing charges to become delinquent as defined in this chapter. 
(2)  Restoration of service. It shall be the responsibility of any party requesting the restoration of water service to pay all fees, deposits and delinquent charges attributable to the property for which water service is provided.

(6)  Delinquent fees. Delinquent fees shall be set from time to time by resolution of the village president and board of trustees. 
(b)  Delinquent charges; collection: 
(1)  All user charges levied under the provisions of this chapter shall be liens upon the real estate upon or for which service is supplied, as provided by law; however, such liens shall not attach to such real estate until such charges have become delinquent. For the purposes of this section, a charge shall be determined delinquent 30 days after the billing has been mailed. The village shall send to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the charges and a notice that the unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the real estate. The village shall file notice of the lien in the office of the recorder of the county in which such real estate is located. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out: 
a.  A description of the real estate sufficient for the identification thereof; 
b.  The amount of money due for such service; and 
c.  The date when such amount became delinquent. 
(2)  In addition to any other method of collection as herein provided or as is provided by law, the village shall also have the power and authority to sue the occupant or user of that real estate in a civil action to recover money due for water and/or sewer services, plus costs and a reasonable attorney fee to be fixed by the court.

(4)  Liens filed and recorded by the village pursuant to state statutes and village ordinances shall draw interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date of recording until released. In addition thereto, costs may be assessed against each lien filed and recorded. These costs shall include the actual costs incurred by the village as assessed by the county recorder and an administrative fee in an amount equal to 50 percent of the county recording fee, and may, at the sole discretion of the user, include a release of lien fee in the amount as assessed by the county recorder and an administrative fee in an amount equal to 50 percent of the county recording fee; and if release of lien fee is paid, the village, at no additional costs to the user, shall obtain, on user's behalf, the release of lien. 
(5)  In the event a bill is not paid within 30 days after mailing and has, therefore, become delinquent as provided herein, the village shall have the power, in addition to the other powers herein granted, to refer the bill for collection to a collection agency, or other appropriate parties or agencies, for collection. At the time of such referral, the village shall make an additional charge to the user in the amount of $50.00, which charge shall be added to the user's delinquent bill. It is hereby determined that such additional charge is reasonable and proper in order to help the village defray its costs of collection. 
(6)  No charges shall be made for water leaking from the service pipe that has not passed through the meter nor shall any deduction or allowance be made with respect to the bill on account of leakage after water has passed through the meter.

(a)  Order to discontinue discharge; notice; hearing. Whenever the village engineer or director of public works shall determine that sewage or industrial wastes or other wastes are being discharged into any of the waters of the village, or the village sewerage system, and when in the opinion of the village engineer or director of public works such discharge pollutes the waters of the village or district, or interferes with the operation of the sewerage system of the village or district, the village engineer or director of public works may order whosoever causes such discharge to show cause before the village president and board of trustees why such discharge should not be discontinued. To that end a notice shall be served on the offending party directing him or it to show cause why an order should not be made directing the discontinuance of such discharge. Said notice shall specify the time and place where a hearing will be held and notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered mail at least five days before said hearing. In the case of a municipality or a corporation, such service shall be upon an officer thereof. The village president and board of trustees may take evidence with reference to said matter and, after reviewing such evidence may issue an order to the party responsible for such discharge, directing that within a specified period of time thereafter such discharge be discontinued unless adequate treatment works shall have been installed, or existing adequate treatment works be properly operated or unless the sewers through which such discharge is made are connected to a system of intercepting sewers to the sewage treatment works of the district in such manner as directed by the village president and board of trustees. The foregoing procedure shall be applicable to the provisions of subsection (b) herein. 
(b)  Revocation, modification of permit. The village may recommend that any permit authorized and issued under the provisions of any ordinance of the Fox Metro Water Reclamation District be revoked or modified after notice and hearing as provided herein and when necessary to prevent pollution of the waters of the village or district or to prevent interference with the operation of the said sewerage system. 
(c)  Violation of order to be considered nuisance. If any person, firm, association or corporation discharges sewage or industrial wastes or other wastes into the aforesaid waters of the village or district, or said sewerage systems contrary to the orders of the board of trustees, the board of trustees may commence action in the circuit court in and for Kane County, for the purpose of having such discharge stopped either by mandamus or injunction. 
(Ord. No. 1723, § 1(Exh. A), 3-28-16) 
Sec. 20-66. - Penalties. 
(a)  Action to impose fines for violations of this article shall be brought in the corporate name of the village as plaintiff. Such action shall commence with a complaint or a warrant.

4. LOTS
a. ON REVERSED CORNER LOTS. On a reversed corner lot in a residential district accessory buildings (garages, gazebos, porches, sheds for example) or portions thereof are prohibited within five (5) feet of any part of a rear lot line which coincides with a side lot line or portion thereof of property in a residential district.
b. ON DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS. The rear yard and corresponding rear setback line shall be the same depth as the front yard of the adjacent lot. If there are varied front yards on either side of a double frontage lot then the deeper front yard shall be used. For example, if one front yard is twenty (20) feet and the other is twenty-five (25) feet the twenty-five (25) foot yard shall be used. However, for residential uses the rear yard shall adhere to the same restrictions for open space and accessory uses and structures as if it was a front yard. For example, if a shed, swimming pool, and a six (6) foot fence are prohibited in the front yard, they would also be prohibited in the rear yard for a double frontage lot. If the lots on both sides of the double frontage lot are also double frontage lots then the rear yard shall adhere to the districts rear yard requirement. (see Double Frontage Lot Definition)

Page 126
b. B-2 General Retail Business District: This district focuses on general retail and is generally located along major commercial corridors not necessarily adjacent to residential uses. This district will see larger corporate stores and is more tailored to the automobile for transportation.
c. B-3 Service, Automotive and Wholesale Business District: This district focuses on automotive service uses, wholesale uses and business uses that would not generally be found in retail oriented districts such as the B-2 District. These uses tend to be more industrial in nature as opposed to retail based.
9.04 MD-MILL DISTRICT
1. GENERAL CONDITIONS. The Mill District is intended to promote and encourage traditional downtown development through the efficient use of land development practices. The Mill District shall follow a form based development approach, which puts more focus and emphasis on the form of the building and development of the site as opposed to the use of the building. This will be enforced through the Villages Design Review Guidelines Ordinance as well as the bulk regulation table below. While objective standards have been created, the development of each site is also subjective and the Village will work with each developer in order to produce the most desirable building form based on the objective standards and subjective illustrations and desires of the Village. The uses in the Mill District are encouraged to follow the land development practice of mixed-use and shall be subject to the following conditions.
a. All goods produced on the premises shall be sold as retail on the premises where produced.
b. The sale of foodstuffs or articles intended for human consumption shall be conducted wholly within an enclosed building except if the establishment is considered a restaurant or other food vendor which provides outdoor seating and eating areas permitted by this section.
c. There shall be no manufacture, processing or treatment of products other than those which are clearly incidental and essential to the retail business conducted on the same premises.
d. Such uses, operations or products shall not be objectionable due to odor, dust, smoke, noise, vibration or other similar causes.
Page 127
e. All business, servicing, or processing, except for off-street parking or loading, shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings unless otherwise indicated.
2. LANDSCAPING & STORMWATER. Best Management Practices are encouraged to mitigate the amount of stormwater run off. Underground detention is more practical in an urban setting as this. Ground mounted landscaping planters or landscaping beds are required at public entrances facing public streets (not alleys) and should consist of shrubbery and perennial plantings that provide year round coverage. Annual plantings are encouraged as well. If ground mounted planters are placed in public right-of-way the property or business owner is responsible for the maintenance of the landscaping. Perimeter landscaping is not required except for transitional yards. If on-site parking lots are provided the parking lot landscaping requirements of the landscape section of this ordinance shall apply. Parkway trees are required every forty (40) feet. Plant material sizes shall comply with Section 12A of this ordinance.
3. BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS. In order to provide a cohesive aesthetic to the Mill District, all new buildings are encouraged to use building materials similar to what has been used on the Village Hall building and similar to the existing buildings in the Mill District such as Grays Mill. Appropriate materials include the use of brick and natural stone; vinyl, wood and cement siding are encouraged as accent materials but discouraged as primary siding materials. In addition other architectural elements are encouraged such as recessed entry ways, display windows on the ground floor, awnings over ground floor windows and entry ways, as well as any other features that will enhance the appearance and curb appeal of the building. Creativity is highly encouraged.

Section 12A.00  TREE PRESERVATION & LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
12A.01 PURPOSE.
This Section is established to create uniform landscape, screening and tree preservation standards for development of property in the Village through review of plans in order to ensure that the Village remains attractive, safe and comfortable. Landscaping required by this Section shall be a condition to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and Zoning Occupancy for any improvements built on a lot in the Village. When a new use or owner occupies an existing improved lot or building, said lot shall come into substantial compliance with the standards in this section. In some cases it may not be practical to comply with all standards due to existing site constraints and conditions; as such, each existing improved lot shall be reviewed on a case by case basis by the Village to determine how each standard can be met with some room for deviation from the standards. The landscape standards herein are established:
A. To promote, protect and preserve the general health and safety of the people of the community and, as part of the general welfare, ensure aesthetic compatibility among land uses within the community;
B. To conserve soil and reduce soil erosion, reduce storm water run-off, to provide oxygen regeneration to enhance air quality, and to reduce the effects of urban heat islands;
C. To minimize the harmful or nuisance effects resulting from noise, dust, debris, motor exhaust, headlight glare, artificial light intrusions, objectionable sights or activities, or similar incompatible impacts conducted or created by adjoining or nearby land use;
D. To safeguard the environmental quality and aesthetic character of the community by limiting the removal and insuring replacement of trees upon private property within the Village;
E. To preserve, as is practical, existing vegetation and topographical features by limiting unnecessary clearing and modification of land, encouraging the retention of existing mature trees, requiring the replacement of indigenous trees with approved species; and,
F. To encourage the energy efficient operation of land uses in the public interest.
G. To ensure that the general intent of this section is met as property is developed and redeveloped within the Village.
Page 175
12A.02 TREE PRESERVATION AND REMOVAL REGULATIONS.
It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or cause the removal of any tree having a caliper of six (6) inches or greater in the Village of Montgomery without having first obtained approval from the Village of Montgomery a Tree Preservation and Removal Plan as described herein. Nothing in this Section 12A.02 shall apply to tree removal by an owner of a lot having a single family, two-family or duplex dwelling located thereon.
A. TREE PRESERVATION AND REMOVAL PLAN. A Tree Preservation and Removal Plan may be required for any parcel of land involving the construction of any new building(s) or structure(s) or other site improvements, or the removal of a deciduous tree having a caliper of six inches (6) or greater. All Tree Preservation and Removal Plans shall include or have attached thereto the following information:
1. The location of those trees to be removed and preserved and the methods which are to be used to remove and preserve such trees during site development and/or tree removal procedures.
2. A written statement indicating the reason for removal of the tree(s). A report from a licensed Illinois arborist may be requested by the Director of Community Development if deemed appropriate.
3. A description of the tree(s) to be removed, including scientific name, common name, form (single stem vs. multi-stem, clump, etc.) and tree caliper size (measured one foot (1) above the ground), and general conditions or any unique qualities.
4. Details, specifications and/or technical information of materials or procedures to be used to preserve and protect trees. This information shall also be indicated on the grading plan.
B. GENERAL TREE PRESERVATION AND REMOVAL PLAN STANDARDS AND CRITERIA
1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to retain existing trees on the aforementioned tree survey through the integration of those trees into the site plan and landscape plan for a proposed development.
2. Grading and construction equipment shall be forbidden from encroaching within the preservation zone of a protected tree (see Figure 1).
3. Crushed limestone hydrocarbons and other material detrimental to trees shall not be stored or dumped within the preservation zone of any tree nor at any higher location where drainage toward the tree could conceivably affect the health of the tree.
Page 176
4. Areas proposed for washing trucks should be designed and located such that wash water is directed into a silt trap and not allowed to be routed toward trees approved for preservation.
Figure 1. Critical Root Zone
5. Toxic chemicals, gasoline, oil and other injurious substances shall not be stored or allowed to seep, drain or empty within one hundred feet (100) of the preservation zone of protected trees.
Page 177
6.Snow fencing shall be temporarily installed at the periphery of the treespreservation zone.
7.The critical root zone of tree trunks and branches shall be protected whenconstruction must occur within a tree preservation zone with an approvedmethod identified in the preservation plan.
8.No grade changes shall be allowed under preservation zone of any treesdesignated for preservation.
9.No ropes, signs, wires, unprotected electrical installation or other device ormaterial shall be secured or fastened around or through a protected tree.
10.To improve the survival rate of tree, root pruning and/or tree thinning should beperformed in accordance with the Arboricultural Specifications Manual.
11.In the event that underground utility lines are proposed within five feet (5) of thetrunk of a tree, then auguring of the utility line should be considered and may berequired by the Village.
C. TREE REPLACEMENT REQUIRED. Any tree intended to be removed or unintentionally removed or damaged during construction on the lot shall be replaced in the manner herein prescribed. There are two options to choose from to determine the number of replacement trees; the applicant may choose either option. (See Section 12A.02(C)(8) for replacement options).
1.Option 1: For every tree designated for removal that is greater than six (6) inchesin caliper one (1) replacement tree shall be required per tree removed.

Shrubs
Deciduous
24 Tall
Evergreen
24 Tall
Dwarf Varieties
24 Spread
Ground Cover
2-3 Pots
d. PROHIBITED TREES. Village staff and the Village Arborist shall maintain, update and amend as needed in their discretion a permitted and prohibited tree list which shall govern which species of trees are permitted or prohibited in certain areas of the Village. Property owners shall consult with Village staff and/or the Village Arborist prior to planting any tree to satisfy the requirements of this Section

All trees shall be first grade nursery stock with straight trunks, straight and live central leader and full well developed crown consistent with the species/variety.
It is in the Villages best interest to minimize the customization of landscaping that occurs around the base of parkway trees. The improper mounding of mulch, construction of planter boxes, the installation of paver or concrete edging around parkway trees and other improvements of such nature may be
Page 184
detrimental to the tree, and therefore, the Village Arborist shall have the authority to remove such improvements or require the removal of the improvements by the adjacent property owner at the property owners expense. The property owner shall receive written notice of the violation and be provided five (5) days to correct the violation prior to removal by the Village Arborist.
3.Installation of Plant Materials. Plant materials of all types and species shall beinstalled in accordance with the minimum technical specifications of the IllinoisLandscape Contractors Association, including the provisions for guarantee andreplacement. An onsite pre-planting meeting is recommended between thedeveloper and Village prior to installation of the plant material.

Non-residential detention/retention basins and ponds forindividual site development projects (for example a single lot developmentproject that builds one building not part of a larger subdivision/development) are
Page 185
not required to follow these guidelines; only the Kane County Stormwater Ordinance is required to be adhered to. There is a recommended Conservation Seed Mix in the planting guidelines for individual site development projects which will provide lower maintenance costs. The Kane County Stormwater Ordinance does require the use of Best Management Practices (MBPs) in the design of stormwater facilities. Therefore, it is up to the developers discretion which type of BMP is used. The County does have a Technical Manual that offers different BMP options. If the developer does choose to use naturalized wetland and prairie plants as a BMP option they shall follow the Villages guidelines. Additional plantings, such as trees and shrubs, are prohibited if prairie grasses/flowers are used on the basin slopes. Trees and shrubs are in conflict with the use of prairie grasses/flowers. Some species of trees may be allowed in limited quantity but on a case by case basis at the discretion of the Village. Plants must be able to tolerate wet conditions if planted within the basin.
8. ENERGY CONSERVATION
a. Wherever possible, deciduous trees, shrubs and vines should be planted along the south and west sides of buildings and plaza areas to provide shade during the summer and limited shade during winter.

H. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. The Village recommends and encourages the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs). BMPs should be used where appropriate and planned for when larger developments approach the Village. Typical BMPs include permeable pavers, rain gardens, bioswales, and depressed landscape islands to name a few.
I. ADDITIONAL LANDSCAPE SETBACK REQUIREMENTS
1. For the purpose of improving the safety, appearance and environment along the major transportation arterials and collector streets of the Village, landscaped setbacks shall be provided and maintained on all properties except those used for single-family dwellings as follows:

K. ADMINISTRATION OF LANDSCAPING AND TREE PRESERVATION REGULATIONS.
1. APPROVAL OF PLANS. THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVAL OF ALL PLANS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION. ANY APPEAL FROM AN ORDER OF THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SHALL BE MADE TO THE ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPEALS SECTION IN SECTION 14 OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE.
2. VARIATIONS FROM REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION. The Village recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, some flexibility in applying standards set forth in Sections 12A.02 and 12A.03 are appropriate as long as the intent of specified requirements are met. Whenever the Village allows or requires a deviation from the requirements set forth in this Section, such deviation should be included on the landscape plan, including the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation from the requirements of this Section. Any requested deviations from the standards specified herein, must be approved by the Director of Community Development. If in the opinion of the Director of Community Development the deviation does not meet the intent of this Section, then a request for deviation shall be filed for the next available Plan Commission meeting. The Plan Commission shall make the final determination on the deviation request.
3. CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. All required landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If weather conditions or other circumstances beyond the developers control prevent installation of all or portions of the landscape materials and all other requirements for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy have been met, a letter of credit or a performance bond approved by the Village Attorney to insure completion of approved landscaping shall be filed with the Village. The amount of the performance guarantee and the required completion data shall be recommended by the Director of Community Development based on current costs and set by the Village. If such a letter of credit or performance bond has already been submitted for the proposed landscape improvements, the Village may permit the developer to extend the performance guarantee for an additional specified period of time.
L. GUIDELINES FOR REVIEWING LANDSCAPE PLANS. A landscape plan shall be approved if the conditions of Section 12A.00 are satisfied and the general intent is met.
Page 200
Section 13.00  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
13.01 PURPOSE
The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public streets and so promote the safety and welfare of the public, by establishing requirements for all off-street parking and loading and unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use of the property.
13.02 AUTHORIZATION
Subject to the limitations of this Section 13 of the Zoning Ordinance, off-street parking is permitted as an accessory use in all districts. Off-street parking as a principal use is permitted only when expressly authorized by the regulations found in this section and in the applicable zoning district. In non-residential zoned property, nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of any person to provide off-street parking in excess of the requirements herein established but all such parking shall comply with the standards of this section.
13.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS  PARKING
1. APPLICABILITY
a. GENERAL APPLICABILITY. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all existing and new uses. Off-street parking spaces sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Section shall be provided for all existing and new uses, except as provided in the following applicability paragraphs.
i. CHANGE IN EXISTING USE. Whenever a use existing on the passage of this Zoning Ordinance Amendment is changed thereafter to a new use, parking facilities shall be provided as required herein for such new use.
ii. INCREASE IN USE INTENSITY. Whenever the intensity of use of any building, structure or use of a parcel is increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified in the Schedule of Parking Requirements for required parking spaces, parking spaces as required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
Page 201
iii. DECREASE IN USE INTENSITY. Whenever the intensity of any building, structure or use of a parcel is decreased by the reduction of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified in the Schedule of Parking Requirements for required parking spaces, and further, when the decrease would result in a requirement of fewer total off-street parking facilities, off-street parking facilities may be reduced accordingly. This reduction is allowed provided that existing off-street parking spaces shall be so decreased only when the facilities remaining will at least equal or exceed the off-street parking requirements resulting from application of the standards of this Section to the use of the entire building, structure or use of a parcel of land as modified.
iv. EXCEPTION FOR NONCONFORMING LOCATIONS AND DESIGN. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit the continued utilization of any parking space as an accessory use to any building, structure or use of a parcel for parking of a vehicle that may lawfully be parked in such a space solely because such space does not satisfy the locational or design requirements of this Code, or any amendment to it, if such space was legally in use as an accessory use to such building, structure or use of a parcel on the effective date of this Ordinance or such amendment.
b. PERMIT REQUIRED. A permit is required for any additional parking area, removal of parking area, resurfacing of parking areas or restriping of parking facilities.
13.04A DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE - PARKING
1. ACCESS. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements. A properly scaled site plan shall be submitted and a permit acquired.
2. DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE.
a. SIZE. All parking stalls and aisle dimensions shall have the minimum dimensions, as set forth in Appendix A-1. Parking lots not open to the sky shall have a minimum vertical clearance of seven (7) feet six (6) inches to any obstruction.
Page 202
b. MEASUREMENT OF SPACE. When determination of the number of required off- street parking spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded, and fractions over one-half (1/2) shall be interpreted as one (1) parking space.
c. OPEN AND ENCLOSED SPACES. Parking area may be enclosed (in a garage) or open to the sky, as described in this section.
d. SIGNS. No sign shall be displayed in any parking area within residential district, except such as may be necessary for the orderly use of the parking facilities.
e. RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY MAXIMUM WIDTH. The maximum width of a Single Family Residential Home is thirty (30) feet.
f. PARKING LOT ISLANDS. Parking lot islands are required per Section 12A of the Zoning Ordinance regarding Landscaping.
g. LIGHTING. Lights shall be provided for all non-residential uses and multi-family uses on site, except as otherwise approved by the Village. Lights shall be provided at appropriate locations throughout the site in order to provide adequate lighting for the entire site for the safety of its patrons and employees at a minimum of 1.0 foot-candle. Light poles shall not exceed a maximum height of twenty feet (20) in Residential and Business Zoning Districts in order to promote a pedestrian scale lighting system. Light poles shall not exceed a maximum height of thirty feet (30) in Manufacturing Zoning Districts. Building wall lights shall not exceed a maximum height of twenty feet (20). All light shall be down cast and shielded from horizontal light spillage and directed at the ground; overspill of light may be allowed through a deviation approved by the Plan Commission per the process described in Section 12A03(K). Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed away from the residential properties in such a way as not to create a nuisance. Lighting is not required in outdoor storage areas.
h. CURBS AND GUTTERS. Combination concrete curb and gutter or concrete barrier curb is required around the perimeter of all parking lots with greater than five (5) spaces and around all islands. Where alternatives to concrete curb and gutter are demonstrated to be more appropriate and recommended by the Village Engineer, said alternatives may be approved by the Director of Community Development.
i. WHEEL GUARDS. In the event that curb and gutter is not installed, wheel guards shall be provided for all spaces that front onto a landscape area or walkway that is at a level grade with the parking space. Such wheel guards shall not impede
Page 203
accessibility under the Illinois Accessibility Code. Wheel Guards may also be required in the event that the proposed parking spaces may case interference with pedestrian amenities. Wheel guards shall be a minimum height of six 6 inches and securely anchored into the ground.
j. STRIPING. Striping of the pavement surface to define each parking space is required and shall be a minimum of four (4) inches in width for the length of each space. Striping for each parking space shall be painted in yellow or white. Thermoplastic pavement markings are an acceptable alternative. All areas designated as fire lanes shall be marked by posting signs and/or yellow markings, provided that signs shall be used wherever feasible.
k. MAINTENANCE. Upon completion of parking facilities, all parking areas shall be properly maintained at all times, without potholes, broken curbing or other irregularities.
l. REQUIRED SETBACKS. No parking space nor portion thereof established on the same zoning lot shall be located within a required setback, nor within a required landscape buffer area. Limited exceptions to these requirements can be found in the various Zoning Standards, Bulk Regulations and Use Tables. These areas shall be landscaped according to Section 12A of the Zoning Ordinance regarding Landscaping.
It is the goal of the Village to reduce the amount of parking along street frontages and near front yards. It is strongly recommended that buildings be brought toward the street as much as possible in order to create a more pedestrian friendly environment and reduce the amount of parking visible from the street. This is a guideline but will be used in review of developments. Developers should work with staff and the Village to accomplish this goal. Examples have been provided as to how this can be accomplished; see Site Development Exhibit at the end of this section. A development should accommodate both the automobile and the pedestrian.
m. SURFACING. All open off-street parking areas and drive/access aisles shall be improved with a compacted stone base not less than twelve (12) inches thick, IDOT CA-6 gradation, and surfaced with four (4) inches minimum bituminous asphalt, two and one half (2.5) inches of binder and one and one half (1.5) inches of surface. Concrete is an approved material and shall be improved with a compacted stone base not less than four (4) inches thick, IDOT CA-6 gradation, and surfaced with no less than six (6) inches of concrete material. Paver parking facilities are allowed as approved by the Village Engineer. All surfaces used for vehicular parking, access or storage shall be improved to the above standards.
Page 204
n. APARTMENT COMPLEX GARAGES. Any detached garage built as an accessory to an apartment or condominium, as required in this section, shall be required to build in accordance with the following:
i. Garage exteriors must be designed of a minimum of thirty percent (30%) masonry (i.e. brick, stone, etc.) building materials;
ii. Garage exterior building materials must reflect the character of those used on the primary building or structure; and
iii. Garages must have a varied roofline, examples include, but are not limited to, dormers, cupolas, gables, etc.
o. ACCESSIBLITY. All parking lots shall adhere to the most current Illinois Accessibility Code.
3. BICYCLE PARKING. All non-residential uses shall provide bicycle parking facilities at the rate of three (3) bicycle parking spaces for the first thirty (30) automobile parking spaces provided and one (1) additional bicycle parking space for each ten (10) additional automobile parking spaces provided, up to a maximum of thirty (30) bicycle parking spaces. A minimum of three (3) bicycle parking spaces are required per building within the Mill District. Bicycle racks shall be installed to support the frame of the bicycle and not just the wheel and shall be permanently anchored and shall not interfere with pedestrian movement. These requirements can be varied by the Plan Commission or at the discretion of the Director of Community Development; some uses may not warrant multiple bicycle parking facilities. All uses shall provide a minimum of three (3) bicycle parking spaces.
4. LAND BANKING IN MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS. Upon approval by the Community Development Department and when geographically feasible, manufacturing district users shall be allowed to provide open space in lieu of parking which can be readily converted to parking facilities. The design of the parking facilities to be constructed within a land banked area, if converted, must comply with the off-site parking requirements as set forth elsewhere in this ordinance at the time the land bank is approved.
The owner of the property to be land banked shall submit a detailed land bank parking plan for review and approval by the Director of Community Development. The plan shall show full compliance with the parking regulations of this ordinance, the proposed reduced number of parking spaced to be provided and the land banked area set aside as open space.
Page 205
Following notice to the property owner, the Village based on increased parking demand shall have the right, in its sole discretion to require the property owner or successor to construct all or a portion of the required parking within the land banked area.
As a condition of approval, the property owner shall file with the County Recorded a covenant in a form and substance approved by the Village Attorney, which outlines the conditions of the land bank.
13.04B LOCATION OF PARKING FACILITIES
1. EXTENT OF CONTROL. Off-street automobile parking facilities shall be located as hereinafter specified; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking area to the nearest entrance of the building that said parking area is required to serve; in no instance shall off-street parking or loading facilities, when in use, extend into a public right-of-way in which said vehicle is extended any way except parallel to the public right-of-way abutting a curb in which said vehicle would otherwise block vehicular or pedestrian traffic:
a. ONE AND TWO-UNIT DWELLINGS. For one and two-unit dwellings, on the same lot with the building they are required to serve.
b. THREE AND FOUR-UNIT DWELLINGS. For three and four-unit dwellings, on the same lot or parcel of land as the building they are required to serve. For the purpose of these suggested standards, a group of such uses constructed and maintained under single ownership or management shall be assumed to be on a single lot or parcel of land.
c. APARTMENT HOUSES. For apartment houses containing four (4) or more dwelling units, on the same lot or parcel of land as the building they are required to serve, or on a separate lot or parcel of land not more than three hundred (300) feet from the nearest entrance to the principal building being served provided the lot or parcel of land selected for the parking facilities is located in an apartment district or a less restricted district.
d. Additional RESIDENTIAL AND SERVICE USES. For rooming houses, lodging houses, clubs, hospitals, sanitariums, orphanages, homes for the aged, convalescent homes, dormitories, sorority and fraternity houses, and for the other similar uses, the off-street parking facilities required shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the principal building or buildings being served, or upon
Page 206
properties contiguous to the zoning lot upon which is located the building or buildings they are intended to serve.
e. NON-RESIDENTIAL USES. Non-residential uses other than those specified above, off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot or parcel of land as the principal building being served, or on a separate lot or parcel of land not over one thousand (1,000) feet from the entrance to the principal building, measured from the nearest point of the parking area, provided the separate lot or parcel of land intended for the parking facilities is located in the same district as the principal permitted use or in a less restricted district.
f. JOINT PARKING FACILITIES. Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted. Consideration shall be given to the hours of operation of the various uses, and in the event that all of the uses operate concurrently the total number of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements for each. All joint parking requests shall be reviewed and approved by the Director of Community Development, of whose decision may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals per Section 14 of this ordinance. Documentation shall be provided demonstrating authorization to park on the property and the amount of parking dedicated to each entity utilizing the site for parking.
g. MILL DISTRICT ZONED PROPERTIES. Properties that are zoned MD-Mill District shall not be required to provide off-street parking, with the exception of residential uses that shall provide one half (0.5) spaces for every residential unit. The intent is to create a pedestrian friendly environment and encourage the use of alternative forms of transportation and promote the most efficient use of land for non-residential uses. On-street parking shall be provided in the form of angled or parallel parking in order to maximize the number of parking spaces allowed based on roadway widths and conditions.
13.04C PROHIBITED USES OF OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES
1. Prohibited USES OF PARKING FACILITIES.

See Section 13.04(3) for Bicycle Parking Requirements.
4. ABBREVIATIONS. The term GFA in the below table stands for gross floor area. The term SF in the below table stands for square feet.
5. POPULATION CALCULATIONS. When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of employees, customers, students or similar measures, the maximum number for which the structure is designed shall govern except that when the structure has no design capacity, the maximum number present at any one time shall govern as documented by the petitioner.
6. OTHER USES. For uses not listed hereinafter in this schedule of parking requirements, parking spaces shall be provided on the same basis as required for the most similar listed use, or as determined by the Director of Community Development.

buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique character cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use of the particular location. Such special uses fall into two categories;
a.Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-regulated utilities, or uses traditionallyaffected with a public interest.
b.Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the operation may giverise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property orpublic facilities.
2.AUTHORITY. Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the Village Board in accordancewith the provisions of this ordinance applicable to amendments of this ordinance andthe regulations and conditions set forth in this ordinance for special uses. No applicationfor a special use shall be acted upon by the Village Board until after:
a.A written report is prepared by the Community Development Department andforwarded to the Village Board by the Plan Commission in a manner prescribedherein for amendments to this ordinance; and
b.A public hearing has been held by the Plan Commission after due notice bypublication as prescribed herein, for amendments, and the findings andrecommendations of the Plan Commission have been reported to the Village Board.
3.INITIATION. An application for a special use may be made by the Village Board, the PlanCommission or the owner of the property.
4.NOTICE TO OTHER PROPERTY OWNERS. The notice provisions for variation shall apply to allapplications for special uses.
5.APPLICATION. An application for special use shall be on an application provided by theCommunity Development Department and shall contain all information required on suchform, including the following:
a.Legal description of the property;
b.Plat of survey;
c.Statement along with evidence showing that the proposed special use will conformto the standards set forth in this section.
Page 229
6.PROCESSING. All documents shall be filed at least thirty (30) days before any regularlyscheduled Plan Commission meeting. An application for a special use shall be filed withthe Community Development Department and the Village Clerk, and therefore processedin the manner prescribed heretofore for amendments.
The Plan Commission shall hold the public hearing and forward its recommendations inthe form of a written report, to the Village Board within thirty (30) days following thedate of public hearing on each application, unless it is withdrawn by the petitioners.
7.RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PLAN COMMISSION. No special use shall be recommended by thePlan Commission unless the Commission shall find that the following standards havebeen satisfied:
a.That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not bedetrimental to endanger the public health, safety, comfort or general welfare;
b.That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other propertyin the immediate vicinity for the purpose already permitted, not substantiallydiminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
c.That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderlydevelopment and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted inthe district;
d.That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been,or are being, provided;
e.That adequate measures have been, or will be, taken to provide ingress and egress sodesigned as to minimize traffic congestion in public streets; and
f That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Village Board pursuant to the recommendations of the Plan Commission.
8.PROTESTS. Any proposed special use which fails to receive the favorable vote of a majorityof the Plan Commission members and is so reported, shall not be passed by the VillageBoard except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all trustees of the Village Board.
In case of a written protest against any proposed special use, signed and acknowledgedby the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered or by theowners to twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alleytherefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly oppositethe frontage proposed the be altered, is filed with the Village Clerk, the proposed special
Page 230
use shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the trustees of the Village Board. A copy of the written protest shall be served by the protester(s) on the applicant for the proposed amendment and a copy upon the applicant's attorney, if any, by certified mail at the address of such applicant and attorney shown in the application for the proposed amendment.

b.To promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities thatresults in better design and development with the inclusion of aesthetic amenities;
c.To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and buildingrelationships with a possible mixing of different relationships with the mixing ofdifferent urban uses in an innovative design;
Page 231
d. To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic and geological features, and environmentally appropriate features;
e. To create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development;
f. To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities, schools, and other public and private facilities;
g. To promote the economical use of land and installation and maintenance of utilities, street improvements, structures and other facilities;
h. To encourage a land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare;
i. To create a method for the permanent preservation of architectural and/or historic landmarks;
j. To provide amenities not otherwise required by law.
2. PROVISIONS. The basic provisions and requirements concerning Planned Unit Development are as follows: The subdivision, development and use of land as an integral unit, combining more than one primary land use and which may provide for single-family residential, multiple-family residential, education, business, commercial, industrial, recreational, park and common use areas may be described as a Planned Unit Development.
a. In its establishment and authorization as a special use, in addition to the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, requirements, restrictions, standards and conditions shall be observed.
b. The Planned Unit Development may be excluded from the provisions of the subdivision regulations and of the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Montgomery to the extent specified in the final authorization of the Planned Unit Development.

Village of Montgomery Subdivision Ordinance
B. DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS AND SCHOOL SITES OR FOR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF TO THE VILLAGE OF MONTGOMERY.
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the Village, in accordance with the following criteria and formula:
1. Criteria for Requiring Park and Recreation Land Dedication:
a. Recruitment and Population Ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be 10.00 acres of land per l,000 of ultimate population in accordance with the following classifications:
TYPES OF RECREATION AREA
SIZE RANGE
MINIMUM ACRES PER
1,000 PEOPLE
i. Play Lot
Minimum 8,000 sq. ft.
Not applicable
ii. School-Park/Neighborhood
Minimum Park of 5 acres
2.5
iii. Neighborhood Park
Minimum 3.5 acres
2.0
iv. District-wide Park
Minimum 4 acres up to 30 acres
2.5
v. Community-wide
Minimum 12 acres
3.0
Total
10.00 acres of land
per 1,000 people
b. Location. The Comprehensive Park and Recreation Plan and/or the Standards by Types of Recreation and Park Areas as adopted by the Fox Valley Park District and the Oswegoland Park District and the Montgomery Comprehensive Plan, shall be used as guidelines in locating sites. A park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than 5 acres shall be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable in large developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances.
c. Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the Village Board, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated public" open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area.
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, 20
Village of Montgomery Subdivision Ordinance
including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the Village, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs" are included in this provision. A copy of "Suggested Criteria for Swimming Pool Development" as adopted by the Fox Valley Park District and the Oswegoland Park District shall be used for the guidance of the developer. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given.
2. Criteria for Requiring School Site Dedication:
a. Requirement and Population Ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedicated requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the (2) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the (3) said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification.
b. School Classification and Size of School Site. School classifications and size of school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
School Classification by Grades
Maximum Number of Students for Each Such School Classification
Minimum Number Acres of Land for Each School Site of Such Classification
Elementary Schools, Grades Kindergarten through 5th (K-5)
600 Students
11 acres
Junior High Schools, Grades 6th through 8th (6-8)
900 Students
29 acres
High Schools,
Grades 9th through 12th
(9-12)
2300 Students
53 acres
c. Location. The Comprehensive School Plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected School District shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
21
Village of Montgomery Subdivision Ordinance
3. Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park and School Sites: Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, the Village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the Village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the Village or other public body designated by the Village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvements to any existing school site which already serves such needs, or for the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution, upon receipt of a written demand by said developer.
a. Fair Market Value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the Village is $88,000 per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein, except as provided in Section One (c)(i)(a) or unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such written objection, the subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by Village staff, the park district, school district or others.
i. As stated in the aforementioned section, the current fair market value of improved land in and surrounding the Village is $88,000 per acre, however, said value as of 9/9/99 was fixed at $42,500 in this ordinance, prior to amendment. In order to foster development, the required contribution amount shall be reduced to the following amounts per acre for the following years, if the required amount is approved by the Village Board and actually paid within said calendar year:
ii. Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee.
22
Village of Montgomery Subdivision Ordinance
Calendar year 1999
$44,000
Calendar year 2000
$55,000
Calendar year 2001
$66,000
Calendar year 2002
$77,000
Calendar year 2003 and beyond
$88,000
b. Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee. There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
i. Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site. That portion of land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated;
ii. A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
4. Density Formula: The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider
23
Village of Montgomery Subdivision Ordinance
or developer. Statistical data obtained from the United States Census Bureau and/or other sources approved by the Village of Montgomery shall be deemed as acceptable sources of demographic data.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the Village Board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by the Park Districts, School District, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
5. Reservation of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the Village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision of planned unit development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developers contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the Village or other public body designated by the Village, provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat.
6. Combining with Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision of planned unit development is less than 40 acres, public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or school sites without hardship on a particular developer.
7. Topography and Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land.
8. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefore. The sidewalk and trees normally included with the definition of improved sites may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school site and construction of school facilities thereon.
9. Land Donations: All land donations required by the ordinance shall be contiguous in one location. All land donations shall be in addition to any detention or retention facilities and shall be measured in acres of land above the high water level. No storm management areas shall be accepted as part or in whole of the land donation requirement.
C. ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED. The preliminary plan of subdivision shall be accompanied by:
