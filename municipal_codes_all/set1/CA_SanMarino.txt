request for hearing form and returning it to the city manager or his/her designee; and 2) either
depositing the civil fine with the city manager or his/her designee or providing notice that a request
for an advance deposit hardship waiver has been filed. A request for hearing form may be obtained
from the city clerk. The request for hearing form and the civil fine or completed hardship waiver
must be received within ten (10) days from the date of service of the citation. If not, the responsible
person waives the right to a hearing.
B. Only after a request for hearing form is received within the required period, and the responsible
person requesting the hearing has either deposited the civil fine in full or obtained an advance
deposit hardship waiver (hereinafter a "perfected appeal"), shall the city set the date and time for

01.06.11: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCEDURES:
A. The city manager shall designate or appoint a hearing officer who shall be selected in a manner
that avoids the potential for pecuniary or other bias and in no event shall the enforcement officer,
nor any other officer or employee in his/her department, be the hearing officer. The compensation,
if any, of the hearing officer shall be paid by the city. Compensation shall not be directly or
indirectly conditioned upon whether or not citations are upheld by the hearing officer.
B. Administrative hearings are informal and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. Each
party shall have the opportunity to present evidence in support of that party's case and to cross
examine any witnesses present. The city bears the burden of proof to establish the violation. The
citation and any additional reports submitted by the enforcement officer shall constitute prima facie
evidence of the facts contained in those documents. The hearing officer must use preponderance
of the evidence as the standard of review in deciding the issues. A responsible person may bring
an interpreter to the hearing provided there is no expense to the city therefor.
C. A responsible person may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration executed under
penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any documents in support thereof shall be served on the
office of the city clerk at least three (3) city business days prior to the hearing. If the responsible
person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, or does not submit a written declaration in a timely
manner, he or she shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. In such an instance, the
hearing officer shall cancel the hearing and not render a decision. In such instances, the citation
shall be deemed final.
D. Hearings may be continued once at the request of a responsible person or the enforcement officer
who issued the citation. The hearing officer may also continue the hearing for cause. (Ord. 0-07-
1189, 9-12-2007)
01.06.12: HEARING OFFICER DECISION; RIGHT OF APPEAL:
A. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision no later than fifteen (15) days after the date on
which the hearing concludes. The decision shall set forth the reasons for the decision along with
notice of the right to appeal pursuant to section 01.06.13 of this article. The administrative hearing
officer's decision shall be final. If the citation is upheld and the violation has not been fully
corrected as of the date of the hearing, the hearing officer shall order correction thereof in the
decision and state the date in which to complete said correction.
B. The decision shall be served by first class mail and shall be deemed to be served on the date it is
deposited with the United States postal service. The failure of the responsible person to receive a
properly addressed decision shall not invalidate the citation, compliance order or the hearing
officer's decision. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007)
01.06.13: APPEAL OF DECISION OF HEARING OFFICER:
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 14/578
Within twenty (20) days after service of the hearing officer's decision upon the responsible person, the
responsible person may seek review of the hearing officer's decision by filing a notice of appeal with
the Los Angeles superior court. The responsible person shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal
upon the city clerk either in person or by first class mail within five (5) calendar days of its filing. If the
responsible person fails to timely file a notice of appeal, the hearing officer's decision shall be deemed
confirmed. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007)
01.06.14: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HEARING OFFICER'S DECISION:
Failure to comply with the hearing officer's decision after it becomes final is a misdemeanor. Filing a
criminal misdemeanor action does not preclude the city from using any other legal remedy available to
gain compliance with the decision. (Ord. 0-07-1189, 9-12-2007)
01.06.15: ADVANCE HARDSHIP WAIVER DEPOSIT:
A. Any responsible person who requests a hearing to contest a citation and who is financially unable
to deposit the civil fine required, may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver. The
request shall be filed with the city manager on an advance deposit hardship waiver application
form, available from the city clerk, no later than ten (10) days after service of the citation. The city
manager's office's failure to receive a completed form, with all supporting documents, within ten
(10) days after service of the citation, shall constitute a waiver of the right to receive a hardship
waiver.
B. The city manager or designee may issue an advance deposit hardship waiver only if the person
requesting the waiver submits a sworn affidavit, together with any supporting documents,
demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city manager or designee the person's financial inability to
deposit with the city the full amount of the civil fine in advance of the hearing. The city manager or
designee shall issue a written decision specifying the reasons for issuing or not issuing the waiver.
The decision shall be served upon the person requesting the waiver by regular mail. If the city
manager or designee determines that the waiver is not warranted the person shall remit the full
amount of the civil fine to the city within ten (10) days of receipt of the written decision. The city
manager or designee's decision whether to issue a hardship waiver shall be final. (Ord. 0-08-1202,

14.12.03: DEFINITIONS:
Except as specifically provided herein, any term used in this article shall be defined as that term is
defined in the current municipal NPDES permit, or if it is not specifically defined in the municipal
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 165/578
NPDES permit, then as such term is defined in the federal clean water act, as amended, and/or the
regulations promulgated hereunder. If the definition of any term contained in the current municipal
NPDES permit conflicts with the definition contained in this article, then the definition contained in the
municipal NPDES permit shall govern. The following words and phrases shall have the following
meanings when used in this article:
AREA SUSCEPTIBLE TO RUNOFF: Any surface directly exposed to precipitation or in the path of
runoff caused by precipitation which path leads off the parcel on which the surface is located.
AUTHORIZED ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: The director of public works or his or her designee.
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE FACILITY: A facility that is categorized in any one of the following standard
industrial classification (SIC) and North American industry classification system (NAICS) codes. For
inspection purposes, permittees need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511
provided that these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to
stormwater.
BASIN PLAN: The water quality control plan, Los Angeles region, basin plan for the coastal
watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, adopted by the regional water board on June 13,
1994, and subsequent amendments.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Practices or physical devices or systems designed to
prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or nonstormwater discharges to receiving waters,
or designed to reduce the volume of stormwater or nonstormwater discharged to the receiving water.
Examples of BMPs may include, but are not limited to, public education and outreach, proper planning
of development projects, proper cleaning of catch basin inlets, and proper sludge or waste handling
and disposal, among others.
BIOFILTRATION: A LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges by intercepting rainfall on
vegetative canopy, and through incidental infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration.
Incidental infiltration is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction.
Therefore, the term "biofiltration" as used in this article is defined to include only systems designed to
facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with
an underdrain (subject to approval by the regional board's executive officer). Biofiltration BMPs
include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales.
BIORETENTION: A LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by intercepting rainfall on vegetative
canopy, and through evapotranspiration and infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a
minimum two foot (2') top layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel filled
temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in this article, a bioretention BMP may be
designed with an overflow drain, but may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is
designed or constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the NPDES permit as biofiltration.
BIOSWALE: A LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with grass or other dense, low growing
vegetation. Bioswales are designed to collect stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow
through the dense vegetation for a period of several minutes.
CITY: The city of San Marino.
CLEAN WATER ACT (CWA): The federal water pollution control act enacted in 1972, by public law
92-500, and amended by the water quality act of 1987. The clean water act prohibits the discharge of
pollutants to waters of the United States unless the discharge is in accordance with an NPDES permit.

mitigated, and not the entire development.
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 177/578
d. Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities that are conducted to
maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, original purpose of facility or emergency
redevelopment activity required to protect public health and safety. Impervious surface
replacement, such as the reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb
additional area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine
maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing roads to
maintain original line and grade.
e. Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are exempt from the redevelopment
requirements unless such projects create, add, or replace ten thousand (10,000) square feet
of impervious surface area.
D. LID Standards Manual: The director shall prepare, maintain, and update, as deemed necessary
and appropriate, a manual ("LID Standards Manual"), which shall include urban and stormwater
runoff quantity and quality control development principles and technologies for achieving
compliance with the provisions of this section. The "LID Standards Manual" shall also include
technical feasibility and implementation parameters, as well as other rules, requirements, and
procedures as the director deems necessary, for implementing the provisions of this article.
E. Specific Requirements:
1. New Single-Family Hillside Homes: To the extent that the city may lawfully impose conditions,
mitigation measures or other requirements on the construction of new single-family hillside
homes, new single-family hillside homes are exempt from the new development/redevelopment
project performance criteria of part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit but shall include mitigation
measures to:
a. Conserve natural areas;
b. Protect slopes and channels;
c. Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage;
d. Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in
slope instability; and
e. Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless the diversion would result in
slope instability.
2. Street And Road Construction: Street and road construction of ten thousand (10,000) square
feet or more of impervious surface are exempt from the new development/redevelopment project
performance criteria of part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit but shall follow the city's "Green Streets
Manual" to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the city's green streets policy.
3. New Development And Redevelopment Projects: Unless otherwise exempted in this article or in
the MS4 permit, the site for every new development and redevelopment project shall comply
with part VI.D.7.c of the MS4 permit and be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and
runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and
controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention
and/or rainfall harvest and use in accordance with the requirements set forth in the MS4 permit
and the "LID Standards Manual". The project applicant shall prepare and submit a stormwater
mitigation plan, which shall implement set LID standards and practices for stormwater pollution
mitigation consistent with this article and the "LID Standards Manual", to the director for review
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 178/578
and approval. The stormwater mitigation plan shall provide documentation to demonstrate
compliance with the MS4 permit on the plans and permit application submitted to the city, and
shall comply with the following:
a. Retain stormwater runoff on site for the stormwater quality design volume (SWQDv) defined
as the runoff from:
(1) The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County 85th
percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or
(2) The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour rain event, whichever is greater.
b. Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in the NPDES
permit.
F. Technical Infeasibility:
1. Some relief, as outlined later in this section, from the MS4 permit (part VI.D.7.c) requirements
may be granted for technical infeasibility. To demonstrate technical infeasibility, the project
applicant must demonstrate that the project cannot reliably retain one hundred percent (100%)
of the SWQDv on site, even with the maximum application of green roofs and rainwater harvest
and use, and that compliance with the applicable postconstruction requirements would be
technically infeasible by submitting a site specific hydrologic and/or design analysis conducted
and endorsed by a registered professional engineer, geologist, architect, and/or landscape
architect. Technical infeasibility may result from conditions including the following:
a. The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not
technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve
reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv on site.
b. Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five (5) to ten feet (10') of surface grade;
c. Locations within one hundred feet (100') of a groundwater well used for drinking water;
d. Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented
concern;
e. Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;
f. Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the
project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the on site volume retention
requirement.
2. If partial or complete on site retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate 1.5
times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained on site. Biofiltration BMPs
must adhere to the design specifications provided in the MS4 permit (order no. R4-2012-0175).
a. Additional alternative compliance options such as off site infiltration and groundwater
replenishment projects may be available to the project site. The applicant for the project
should contact the authorized enforcement officer to determine eligibility.
3. The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered on site must be treated on site to
reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant specific
benchmarks as required by the MS4 permit. Flow through BMPs may be used to treat the
remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 179/578
a. 0.2 inches per hour, or
b. The 1-year, 1-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County
isohyetal map, whichever is greater.
G. Exemptions From LID Requirements: The provisions of this section do not apply to any of the
following:
1. A development involving only emergency construction activity required to immediately protect
public health and safety;
2. Infrastructure projects within the public right of way, excluding street and road construction of ten
thousand (10,000) square feet or more of impervious surface;
3. A development or redevelopment involving only activity related to gas, water, cable, or electricity
services on private property;
4. A development or redevelopment involving only resurfacing and/or restriping of permitted
parking lots, where the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, and original purpose of the
facility is maintained;
5. A project not requiring a city building, grading, demolition or other permit for construction activity.
H. City Review And Approval:
1. Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new development or redevelopment project, the city shall
evaluate the proposed project using the MS4 permit, and erosion and grading requirements of
the city building official or authorized enforcement officer to determine: a) its potential to
generate the flow of pollutants into the MS4 after construction; and b) how well the stormwater
mitigation plan for the proposed project meets the goals of this article. Each plan will be
evaluated on its own merits according to the particular characteristics of the project and the site
to be developed. Based upon the review, the city may impose conditions upon the issuance of
the building permit, in addition to any required by the state construction general permit for the
project, in order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the MS4.
I. Issuance Of Discretionary Permits: No discretionary permit may be issued for any new development
or redevelopment project identified in this section until the authorized enforcement officer confirms
that the project plans, including the stormwater mitigation plan, comply with the applicable LID
requirements. Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty percent (50%) of
impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not
subject to postdevelopment stormwater quality control requirements, the entire project must be
mitigated. Where redevelopment results in an alteration to less than fifty percent (50%) of
impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not
subject to postdevelopment stormwater quality control requirements, only the alteration must be
mitigated, and not the entire development.
J. Issuance Of Certificates Of Occupancy: As a condition for issuing a certificate of occupancy for a
project subject to this article, the director shall require facility operators or owners to build all BMPs
that are shown on the approved project plans and to submit an owner signed certification
statement stating that the site and all LID BMPs will be maintained in compliance with the
stormwater mitigation plan and other applicable regulatory requirements.

1. The transfer or lease of a property subject to a requirement for maintenance of BMPs shall
include conditions requiring the transferee and its successors and assigns to either: a) assume
responsibility for maintenance of any existing BMP, or b) to replace an existing BMP with new
control measures or BMPs meeting the then current standards of the city and the municipal
NPDES permit. Such requirement shall be included in any sale or lease agreement or deed for
such property. The condition of transfer shall include a provision that the successor property
owner or lessee conduct maintenance inspections of all BMPs at least once a year and retain
proof of inspection.
2. For residential properties where the LID BMPs are located within a common area which will be
maintained by a homeowners' association, language regarding the responsibility for
maintenance shall be included in the project's conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs).

10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 210/578
The city council may approve by resolution the installation of stop signs when the city council finds
that the following conditions have been met:
A. The traffic warrants established by the California department of transportation have been satisfied;
or
B. One or more of the warrants below have been satisfied and installation of the stop sign at the
specific location will enhance traffic safety:
1. Partial Stop Sign Control:
a. This warrant is used to provide positive right of way assignment at intersections with potential
right angle conflicts. This warrant is satisfied at any intersection with three (3) or more legs. At
unsignalized intersections with arterial streets, the local or collector street shall have stop sign
control. At local street intersections, the approaches selected to stop sign control should
support an areawide stop sign pattern which avoids creating unimpeded routes.
b. This warrant is used to decelerate traffic approaching a condition with adverse roadway
geometry. This warrant is satisfied at an intersection of local and/or collector streets that is one
hundred feet (100') or less upstream of any vertical curve, horizontal curve, visibility
restriction, or other condition where the difference between the speed limit and design speed
exceeds ten (10) miles per hour. Stop sign control is to be provided on the street with adverse
geometry.
2. Channelized Right Turn: This warrant is used to assign right of way where right turns are made
just outside of a signalized intersection. This warrant is satisfied when any of the following
conditions are present:
a. The associated curb return radius is less than twenty feet (20');
b. There are thirty (30) or more pedestrians per hour during any hour of the day crossing the
channelized right turn;
c. The associated cross traffic visibility is less than 5.5 seconds at prevailing speeds; or
d. Yield sign control has been shown to be inadequate.
3. All Way Stop Sign Control:
a. Minimum Volume: This warrant is used to identify locations with partial stop sign control where
the volume of traffic entering the intersection is so high that there is likely to be an insufficient
number of acceptable gaps to accommodate stop sign controlled cross traffic. This warrant is
satisfied when the total vehicular volume entering the intersection from all approaches
averages at least five hundred (500) vehicles per hour during any six (6) hours of an average
day, and the combined vehicular and pedestrian volumes entering the intersection from the
minor street average at least two hundred (200) units per hour during the same six (6) hours.
When the eighty fifth percentile approach speed of the major traffic exceeds forty (40) miles
per hour, the minimum vehicular volume warrant is seventy percent (70%) of these
requirements.
b. Accident Experience: This warrant is used to identify locations with partial stop sign control
where an accident pattern has developed that is susceptible to correction. This warrant is
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 211/578
satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:
(1) The intersection has experienced three (3) or more reported accidents in the most recent
twelve (12) month period; or
(2) The intersection has experienced two (2) reported accidents per year during any two (2)
years of the most recent four (4) year period.
The accidents shall be of a type susceptible to correction with all way stop sign control and
where an adequate trial with partial stop sign control has proven to be unsatisfactory.
4. Interim Installation: This warrant is used to provide all way stop sign control on an interim basis
when traffic signal control is warranted and arrangements are underway for the signal
installation. This warrant is satisfied on two (2) lane local or collector streets, or on low volume
arterial streets when the need for traffic signal control is urgent.
5. Restricted Visibility: This warrant is used to provide additional right of way assignment at
intersections with restricted visibility. This warrant is satisfied where cross traffic visibility on stop
sign controlled approaches at the intersection of local and/or collector streets is less than one
hundred forty feet (140').
6. Midblock Crosswalk: This warrant is used to provide positive right of way assignment for
pedestrians crossing at a midblock crosswalk. This warrant is satisfied where a marked
crosswalk has been established at a midblock location on a local or collector street without
signal control or warning beacons.
7. Special Facilities: This warrant is used to provide additional right of way assignment at
intersections near institutions primarily serving the youth, elderly and disabled. This warrant is
satisfied at the intersection of local and/or collector streets without signal control or warning
beacons less than one block from:
a. A public or private elementary or middle school.
b. A public library.
c. A recreation center or playground used by children under twelve (12) years of age.
d. A senior citizen center.
e. A medical center or clinic.
f. A center serving the visually, mentally, or physically impaired.
8. Excessive Speeds: This warrant is used to discourage excessive speeds on residentially
developed local and collector streets where speed humps or tables are not feasible or desirable.
This warrant is satisfied where the eighty fifth percentile speed on the street to be controlled
exceeds the speed threshold shown in the table below and the distance between current stop
signs and/or traffic signals on the street to be controlled exceeds the distance threshold show in
the table below. Application of this warrant generally results in all way stop sign control, but can
result in partial stop sign control, if the controlled approaches are reversed.
Street Speed Threshold Distance Threshold
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 212/578
Local 30 mph 1,000 feet
Collector 35 mph 2,000 feet
9. Excessive Through Traffic On Local Streets: This warrant is used to discourage excessive
through traffic on residentially developed local streets. Application of this warrant can result in
partial stop sign control if the controlled approaches are reversed. This warrant is satisfied where
both conditions below apply:
a. The volume on the street to be controlled exceeds one thousand (1,000) vehicles per day and
is at least twenty five percent (25%) greater than that on similar adjacent parallel streets; and
b. The distance between current stop signs exceeds one thousand feet (1,000').
10. Excessive Through Traffic On Collector Streets: This warrant is used to discourage excessive
through traffic on residentially developed collector streets. Collector streets are identified in
community plans. This warrant is satisfied where the daily volume on the collector street
exceeds the volume of trips estimated to be generated by the dwelling units served by the
collector street in the absence of specific data, the threshold volume is considered to be the
product of fifteen (15) multiplied by the number of dwelling units generally within one-eighth (1/8)
mile parallel to the collector street and between arterial street and/or collector street crossings.

Article 08
PARADES AND PUBLIC EVENTS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY
16.08.01: PEOPLES' RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITIES:
A. People may gather on sidewalks and the Huntington Drive medians for the purpose of expression,
dissemination, or communication of opinion, views, or ideas by any means, including, but not
limited to, public oratory and expressive activities protected by the first amendment to the United
States constitution ("expressive activities"), on any day and at any time in accordance with this
article and without a permit and without being subject to any city fees or charges.
1. The medians on Huntington Drive provide the best location for persons to gather for expressive
activities. The city of San Marino is a primarily residential community. It has limited parks and
public areas and those areas do not have sufficient parking to provide for significant gatherings.
Huntington Drive is a large street with three (3) lanes of traffic in each direction, curbside parking
and a median with grass and trees, approximately sixty feet (60') wide and approximately 2.9
miles from the east to the west boundaries of the city (the "Huntington Drive median" or
"Huntington Drive medians"). The medians on Huntington Drive provide a parklike setting with
visibility and access from Huntington Drive. Parking is available on Huntington Drive.
2. Persons shall not use those portions of the Huntington Drive median areas that are within one
hundred feet (100') from the curb of signalized intersections on Huntington Drive while gathering
on the medians. Such areas near signalized intersections must remain clear of pedestrians in
order to reduce traffic hazards for the pedestrians and traffic on Huntington Drive. Additionally,
such areas contain left turn lanes and width of the median is greatly reduced in these areas.
3. The Huntington Drive medians are not the only public areas within the city available for
expressive activities but they do provide adequate space and parking for such activities and can
accommodate expressive activity without the need for a public events permit.
4. People gathering on the Huntington Drive medians and sidewalks for expressive activities shall
comply with all applicable laws and ordinances and traffic and pedestrian laws and ordinances,
including, without limitation, the targeted residential picketing ordinance in chapter XIV, article 17
of this code.
5. Persons gathering on sidewalks for any purposes shall not sit, stand, or act in such a way as to
obstruct the ability of persons to use the sidewalk for passage and shall not sit, stand or act in
such a way as to prevent full compliance with all access requirements under the Americans with
disabilities act or its regulations and similar state and local legislation.
B. Expressive activities on a street or public place not described in subsection A of this section, shall
require a public events permit under this article. Such events could create safety hazards for
participants and disrupt traffic and activities in the areas surrounding the event. The public events
permit process under this article will enable the city manager and the event organizer to mitigate
these potential concerns in the manner specified in this article.

cause all required work to be done, and the persons executing the bond shall be firmly bound for
the payment of all necessary costs therefor; or
B. Enters into a contract with the Council to complete such improvements within a specified
reasonable time after the approval and recordation of the final map, such contract to be secured in

Every surety bond furnished and every contract under which a deposit is made to secure and
guarantee the construction and completion of the improvements required to be done by the
subdivider shall further provide and be conditioned that the surety executing such bond, or such
deposit, respectively, shall continue to be firmly bound under a continuing obligation for the
payment of all necessary costs and expenses that may be incurred or expended by the City in
causing any and all such required work to be done, and that such surety or depositor, respectively,
assents to any lawful extensions of time within which to construct and complete such
improvements that may be granted to the subdivider. A guarantee for the construction and

23.01.10: REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION:
A. Purpose: In accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, it is the purpose of this section to
allow for reasonable accommodations in the city's zoning and land use regulations, policies, and
practices when reasonably necessary to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity
to use and enjoy a dwelling.
B. Permit Application:
1. Applicant: Any person with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of
housing for individuals with a disability may request for reasonable accommodation. The city
shall approve a reasonable accommodation only for the benefit of one or more individuals with a
disability.
2. Application: An application for a reasonable accommodation from a zoning regulation, policy, or
practice shall be made on a form specified by the planning and building director. No fee shall be
required for a request for reasonable accommodation, but the prescribed fees shall be paid for
all other necessary discretionary permits.
3. Other Discretionary Permits: If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation
is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 306/578
request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary
permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint
processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit.
4. Required Submittals: In addition to materials required under other applicable provisions of this
code, an application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following:
a. Documentation that the applicant is: 1) an individual with a disability; 2) applying on behalf of
one or more individuals with a disability; or 3) a developer or provider of housing for one or
more individuals with a disability;
b. The specific exception from or modification to the zoning code provision, policy, or practices
the applicant is requesting;
c. Documentation that the specific exception or modification the applicant is requesting is
necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy the residence;
d. Any other information that the director reasonably concludes is necessary to determine
whether the findings required by this section to approve a reasonable accommodation can be
made, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals
benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the affected
individuals.
C. Review Procedure: The planning commission shall review and approve, conditionally approve, or
deny all applications for a reasonable accommodation subject to, the notice, hearing, and appeal
procedures prescribed by this chapter for a conditional use permit.
D. Required Findings: The decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for a
reasonable accommodation shall be made in writing and shall be based on the following findings,
all of which are required for approval:
1. The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or more individuals with
a disability protected under the fair housing laws.
2. The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability
an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
3. The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on
the city as "undue financial or administrative burden" is defined in fair housing laws and
interpretive case law.
4. The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
city's zoning program, as "fundamental alteration" is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive
case law.
5. The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct
threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property
of others.
E. Alternative Reasonable Accommodations: In making these findings, the planning commission, or
city council on appeal, may approve alternative reasonable accommodations that provide an
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 307/578
equivalent level of benefit to the applicant.
F. Consideration Factors - Necessity: The city may consider, but is not limited to considering, the
following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one
or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling:
1. Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or
more individuals with a disability;
2. Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy
the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation;
3. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to
make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of
the relevant market and market participants; and
4. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar
nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an
equal opportunity to live in a residential setting.
G. Consideration Factors - Fundamental Alteration To Zoning Program: The city may consider, but is
not limited to considering, the following factors in determining whether the requested
accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program:
1. Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the
neighborhood;
2. Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or
insufficient parking;
3. Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of
either the city's general plan or an applicable specific plan; and
4. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an
institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are
similar in nature or operation.
H. Rules While Decision Is Pending: While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all
laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall
remain in full force and effect.
I. Effective Date: No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant
such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an
appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective
unless and until a decision is made by the city council on such appeal.
J. Expiration: Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this chapter
shall expire within twenty four (24) months from the effective date of approval or at an alternative
time specified as a condition of approval unless:
1. A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced;
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 308/578
2. A certificate of occupancy has been issued;
3. The use is established; or
4. A time extension has been granted.
K. Time Extension: The planning commission may approve a single one year time extension for a
reasonable accommodation for good cause. An application for a time extension shall be made in
writing to the director no less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the
expiration date. The request for an extension shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and
appeal requirements applicable to the original application.
L. Violation Of Terms: Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this
code may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are
violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. Revocation of a reasonable
accommodation shall be subject to the same notice, hearing, and appeal requirements applicable
to the original application.
M. Discontinuance: A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is
discontinued for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a
residence vacate the residence, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the
planning director determines that: 1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential
structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the zoning code, or 2) the
accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to reside in
the dwelling. The director may request the applicant or his or her successor in interest to the
property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure
to provide such documentation within ten (10) days of the date of a request by the city shall
constitute grounds for discontinuance by the city of a previously approved reasonable
accommodation.
N. Amendments: A request for changes in conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or
a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval shall be treated as a new application.
The director may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not
involve substantial alterations or addition to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are
consistent with the intent of the original approval. (Ord. 0-12-1264, 5-25-2012)

number of trees required to be planted by this subsection, the Tree Restoration Plan shall
require the trees to be planted on publicly owned property at locations determined by the

connection with a tree that was unlawfully removed, severely pruned, topped or damaged if
the replacement tree(s) dies within one year from the date of the tree removal, severe pruning,
topping or damage, and may impose additional requirements.

A. Purpose:
1. The City Council finds that Federal law prohibits the possession, manufacturing, distribution, and
dispensing of cannabis, and in order to serve the public health, safety, and welfare of the
residents and businesses within the City, the declared purpose of this section is to prohibit all
commercial cannabis activity, for medicinal, adult-use, or any other purpose within the City, as
provided in this section.
2. California Business and Professions Code section 26055(d) provides that a State licensing
authority shall not approve an application for a State license for a cannabis business if approval
of the State license will violate the provisions of any local ordinance or regulation. California
Business and Professions Code section 26200 authorizes a city to adopt and enforce local
ordinances that completely prohibit the establishment or operation of one or more cannabis
businesses licensed under the State, within that city.
3. The City Council finds that a prohibition on all commercial cannabis activity, for medicinal, adultuse,
or any other purpose, is necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health,
safety, and welfare of the City and its community. The City Council's prohibition of such activity is
within the authority conferred upon the City Council by State law and is an exercise of its police
powers to enact and enforce regulations for the public health, safety, and welfare of the City and
its community.

construction was, in fact, consistent with the originally approved conditional use permit or
variance.

conditional use permit or variance, that determination shall constitute a final administrative action
of the city and the applicant may seek a judicial review of that decision in the manner provided

application, informing such owner of the nature of the application, the location of the property
and the time and place of the hearing.
2. The failure on the part of any person to receive or to give due and careful consideration to any
such published or mailed notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings, provided that
such publication and mailing shall have been done in good faith.
F. Investigation Of Facts Bearing On Application: The Commission shall cause to be made by its own

1. That strict application of the regulations and standards of this Chapter will result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of said

topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this Chapter will deprive the
applicant of a reasonable utilization of such property; and

safety or general welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in
which the property is located; and

would be unreasonable and a deprivation of any practical use of the property to deny such
variance; except whenever the application involves a fence, yard, setback or bulk variance (as
opposed to a use, parking or other type variance), it shall not be necessary to make a finding on
this point.
B. The Commission may, in granting a variance, impose such conditions as are necessary to protect

3. Granting a variance confining the use to designate portions of the property or restricting function
of the use to specific days or designated times in a day.

uses are lawful without granting of the variance, even including requiring fulfillment of specific
conditions prior to establishment of the use in question.

Where the parking requirements for a use are not specifically defined herein, the parking requirements
for such use shall be determined by the commission, and such determination shall be based upon
either the requirements for the most comparable use specified herein, or upon a special study of
parking requirements for that use. (Ord. 096-1093, 7-10-1996)
23.10.05: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
The following standards shall apply to all required parking spaces:
A. Size And Access: Each off street parking space shall have an area of not less than one hundred
seventy (170) square feet, exclusive of drives or aisles, and a width of not less than eight and onehalf
feet (8.5'). Each such space shall be provided with adequate ingress and egress to a public
street. No stack or tandem parking shall be permitted.
B. Compact Cars: In every parking area and garage containing ten (10) or more stalls, a maximum of
twenty five percent (25%) of the parking spaces may be designed to accommodate compact cars
and be designed for such use and which shall be clearly marked and designated in the parking
area. Each space will have an area of not less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet and the
following minimum width and length:
Minimum width 8 feet
Minimum length 15 feet
C. Location: Required off-street parking for buildings constructed prior to January 1, 1992, may be
provided on property other than the property for which the parking would serve, subject to the
following requirements:
1. The applicant for the off-site parking plan agrees to immediately cease all operations of the
business for which the off-site parking is to be devoted within thirty (30) days following the
termination of the lease or other arrangements the Commission or Council approved for the offsite
parking unless the Commission, or the Council on appeal, first approves a new off-site
parking plan; and
2. The off-site parking is located within the City and, for parking that is to be utilized by customers,
is not separated from the use by San Gabriel Boulevard, Huntington Drive or San Marino
Avenue; and
3. No reduction of existing on-site parking will result; and
4. No off-site parking to accommodate an expansion or change in use requiring additional parking
will be permitted in connection with an existing use that is nonconforming for failure to provide
sufficient parking unless the off-site parking will provide more parking than the Zoning Ordinance
requires for the change in use; and
5. Any off-site parking located more than three hundred feet (300') from the property which it
serves shall be limited only to employee parking use, and the owner of the property on which the
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 384/578
off-site parking is located and the lot the parking serves shall record covenants restricting such
property to that use; and
6. Parking spaces located at a distance greater than three hundred feet (300') from the property
served shall not be utilized to satisfy more than fifty percent (50%) of the off-street parking
requirement; and
7. The Commission approves an off-site parking plan pursuant to issuance of a conditional use
permit following a public hearing, notice of which is provided to the owner(s) of property located
within three hundred feet (300') of the lots to which the parking is to be dedicated and upon
which the parking is to be devoted, subject to appeal to the Council filed within fifteen (15) days
following the Commission's action. In approving such an off-site parking plan, the Commission
may impose such conditions that it deems necessary. Such conditions may include, but need not
be limited to, measures to ensure that employees of the business shall park at the off-site
location or a requirement that the business provide valet, shuttle, jitney or other services to bring
customers and/or employees from the off-site location to the business. No such plan shall be
approved unless the Commission finds that approval will not harm the public health, safety or
general welfare. In considering such approval, the Commission shall consider the percentage of
parking that will be provided on-site, whether customers and employees will utilize the off-site
parking, the existing parking problems in the neighborhood and the distance between the off-site
parking and the business and such other factors the Commission deems appropriate; and
8. If the parking plan requires employees to utilize the off-street parking, the owner of the business
utilizing the off-site parking shall provide the City with a list of the names and vehicle license
numbers of all employees. This list shall be updated within five (5) working days of a change in
employees or a vehicle utilized by an employee. Failure of the employees to park in the off-site
location shall constitute grounds for revocation of the off-site parking plan.
9. Any lease of off-site parking shall be for an initial term of at least one year, or such longer
minimum term as the Commission approves, and shall be renewable only for terms of one year
or more.
D. Mixed Occupancies In A Building: In the case of mixed users in a building or on a lot, the total
requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as
providing required parking facilities for any other use, except as hereinafter specified for joint use.
If a use or occupancy on a mixed use lot is proposed to be changed to a use or occupancy having
a more restrictive off-street parking requirement, such change shall be allowed only if all uses and
occupancies on the lot will thereafter have the parking required under this Code for new structures.
E. Joint Use: The Commission may, upon the approval of a conditional use permit, authorize the joint
use of parking facilities by the following uses or activities under the conditions specified herein:
1. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking facilities required by this Section for a use considered to
be primarily a daytime use may be provided by the parking facilities of a use considered to be
primarily a nighttime use; up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking facilities required by this
Section for a use considered to be primarily a nighttime use may be provided by the parking
facilities of a use considered to be primarily a daytime use, provided such reciprocal parking
area shall be subject to conditions set forth in subsection E4 of this Section.
2. Up to one hundred percent (100%) of the parking facilities required by this Section for a church

10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 396/578
A. Purpose: A master sign plan is intended to integrate identification signs into the architectural design
of the building, thereby creating an architectural statement of high quality. A master sign plan
provides a flexible means of applying and modifying the sign regulations in this chapter to ensure
high quality in the design and display of multiple permanent signs on multi-tenant buildings and to
encourage creativity and excellence in the design of signs. It is expected that the design quality of
signs proposed under a master sign plan will be of a superior quality and creativity to those that
might result through the normal sign permit process.
B. Applicability: The approval of a master sign plan shall be required and obtained from the planning
commission for all new buildings in the C-1 zone in the following circumstances:
1. Whenever two (2) or more separate commercial tenant spaces are created on the same parcel;
2. Whenever two (2) or more signs are proposed for a building.
C. Existing Buildings With Nonconforming Signs: Any sign made nonconforming by the provisions of
this chapter, may be so continued and maintained until a master sign plan is reviewed and
approved by the design review committee (DRC). The processing fees for a master sign plan shall
be waived if an application is submitted to the planning and building department within two (2)
years of the adoption of this section. This period shall be determined according to the following
provision:
1. A fee exemption period shall begin on the adoption date hereof and a notice will be sent by first
class mail by the planning and building director to the owner(s) of multi-tenant commercial
properties.
D. Approval Authority: A master sign plan shall be approved by the DRC before the issuance of a
building permit. In approving a master sign plan, the DRC shall find that the plan's contribution to
the design quality of the site and the surrounding area will be superior to the quality that would
result under the standard regulations of this chapter.
E. Modification Of Regulations: A master sign plan may include sign regulations that are, at the same
time, more restrictive in some respects than the regulations currently established in this chapter.
Allowed modifications may relate to sign area, number of signs, height, and location.
F. Application Requirements: A master sign plan shall include all information and materials identified
below, and the filing fee in compliance with the most current city council's fee resolution.
1. An accurate plot plan of the entire lot on which the use will be located at a scale of not less than
one inch to one hundred feet (1" = 100').
2. Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways and landscaped areas on the lot.
3. A table (or tables) containing:
a. Computation of the maximum total sign area;
b. Maximum area for individual signs;
c. Height of signs; and
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 397/578
d. Statement of the maximum total sign area and maximum number of signs permitted on the
site by this code.
4. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the location and orientation of each sign for which a
permit is currently being requested, and the anticipated location of future signs requiring a
permit.
5. A description and illustration of the following may be required:
a. Colors and materials to be used in sign construction;
b. Style of lettering for all signs;
c. Appearance/location of logos or icons;
d. Location of each sign on the building(s), with building elevations if necessary;
e. All sign proportions; and
f. Types of illumination.
G. Findings: In order to approve a master sign plan, the following findings shall first be made:
1. The master sign plan complies with the purpose of this chapter, including the commercial design
guidelines;
2. Proposed signs enhance the overall development and are in harmony with other signs included
in the plan with the structures they identify and with surrounding development;
3. The master sign plan contains provisions to accommodate future revisions that may be required
because of changes in use or tenants; and
4. The master sign plan complies with the standards of this chapter.
H. Revisions To Master Sign Plans:
1. Revisions to master sign plans may be approved by the DRC if the intent of the original approval
is not affected.
2. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of
a new master sign plan. (Ord. 0-10-1235, 7-30-2010)

Article 16
WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPING
23.16.01: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
A. The state legislature has found:
1. That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;
2. That the continuation of California's economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of
adequate supplies of water for future uses;
3. That it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to
prevent the waste of this valuable resource;
4. That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and
passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water,
preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;
5. That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water
efficient; and
6. That section 2 of article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is
limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does
not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.
B. Consistent with these findings, the purpose of this article is to establish an alternative ordinance
that is at least as effective as the state model ordinance in the context of the conditions in San
Marino, in order to:
1. Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the
conservation and efficient use of water;
2. Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient
landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a
watershed approach that requires cross sector collaboration of industry, government and
property owners to achieve the many benefits possible;
3. Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing
landscapes;
4. Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper
limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;
5. Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional
agencies;
6. Establish economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water; and
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

t. Areas less than ten feet (10') in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface
irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or overspray.
u. Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty four inches (24") of any nonpermeable
surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from nonpermeable surfaces may include drip,
drip line, or other low flow nonspray technology. The setback area may be planted or
unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material.
These restrictions may be modified if:
(1) The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or
(2) The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to
landscaping; or
(3) The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the
landscape documentation package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation
system design criteria in subsection A1i of this section. Prevention of overspray and runoff
must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.
v. Slopes greater than twenty five percent (25%) shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system
with an application rate exceeding 0.75 inch per hour. This restriction may be modified if the
landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape
documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention
of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.

project arborist must provide the City with written certification of compliance with the tree protection
plan. After any demolition or construction, a registered project arborist must provide the City a
written inspection report regarding the effectiveness of the measures in the tree protection plan.
M. Sandbags, silt screens, or any similar methods are required to be installed on all projects during
the rainy season (October - April) to prevent dirt, mud, and debris from flowing into the storm drain
system. This shall be required only when the front yard landscaping is either removed or modified,
regardless whether such removal or modification was intended as part of the construction project.
N. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) shall be submitted to the Planning and Building
Department during the plan check process for all projects which disturb one or more acres of soil
or whose projects disturb less than one acre but are part of a larger common plan of development
that in total disturbs one or more acres. Projects include soil excavation, soil grading or other
construction activities where soil may be displaced during weather events or landscape water runoff.

A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for expedited processing of applications for
electric vehicle charging stations in compliance with Government Code section 65850.7.
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 465/578
B. Definitions: The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this section:
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION OR CHARGING STATION: Means any level of
electric vehicle supply equipment station that is designed and built in compliance with article 625 of
the California Electric Code, as it read on January 1, 2016, and delivers electricity from a source
outside of an electric vehicle into a plug-in electric vehicle.
ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION: Means a submission of an application utilizing email, the internet,
and/or facsimile transmission.
SPECIFIC, ADVERSE IMPACT: Means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact,
based on objective, identified, and written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions
as they existed on the date an application was deemed complete.
C. Expedited Review Process:
1. The building official shall adopt a checklist of all application requirements for expedited building
permits for electric vehicle charging stations. The checklist shall substantially conform to the
most current version of the "Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist" found in
the "Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook" published by the
Governor's Office of Planning and Research. The checklist, application form, and any other
documents required by the building official to process an application shall be published on the
City's website.
2. Anyone seeking to install an electric vehicle charging station at any site within the City may
apply to the building official for an expedited nondiscretionary building permit.
3. An application for an expedited building permit for an electric vehicle charging station and all
associated documentation may be submitted to the building official in person, by mail, or by
electronic submission. Electronic signatures may be used in lieu of wet signatures.
4. An application that, in the opinion of the building official, satisfies the information requirements of
the checklist adopted by the City shall be deemed complete.
5. If an application for an expedited building permit is deemed incomplete, the building official shall
provide a written correction notice of the deficiencies and the additional information required to
complete the application.
6. If the building official determines that an application for an expedited building permit is complete,
the building official shall process the application. If the building official determines that the
proposed charging station meets all health and safety requirements of State and Federal law,
and would not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the application
shall be approved and a building permit shall be issued.
7. If the building official finds, based on substantial evidence, that a proposed charging station
could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the applicant must apply
for an electric vehicle charging station use permit in order to install the proposed charging
station.
8. An application for an electric vehicle charging station use permit shall be reviewed by the
building official. The building official shall not deny such an application without making written
findings, based upon substantial evidence in the record, that the proposed charging station
would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety which could not feasibly
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 466/578
be satisfactorily mitigated or avoided. The written findings required for rejection of an electric
vehicle charging station use permit application shall include the building official's basis for
rejecting any potentially feasible alternatives that could mitigate or prevent the alleged adverse
impact. Pursuant to Government Code section 65850.7, the building official's review shall be
limited to health and safety issues. Aesthetic concerns, or other items not related to public health
or safety shall not be considered.
9. A decision of the building official made pursuant to subsections C1 through C8 of this section
may be appealed to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission's review shall be
subject to the same limitations as that of the building official, and only health and safety issues
may be considered.
10. Any condition imposed on an application for an expedited building permit or electric vehicle
charging station use permit shall be designed to mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon
health and safety at the lowest possible cost.
D. No Requirement For Association Approval: Consistent with Government Code section 65850.7, the
building official shall not condition the approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on
the approval of such a system by a homeowners association, as that term is defined by Civil Code
section 4080. (Ord. 0-17-1329, 10-11-2017; amd. Ord. 0-18-1335, 4-11-2018)

105.5.1 Extension of Permit - Prior to Expiration.
The Planning & Building Director may extend the expiration date of a building permit for a period
not exceeding 180 calendar days upon a written request from the applicant that is received by
the Planning & Building Director prior to the permit's expiration date. A fee in a sum established
by City Council resolution shall accompany the request, which is not refundable in the event the
request is denied. The written request shall demonstrate justifiable cause for the extension. The
Planning & Building Director shall date and sign extensions that are approved pursuant to this
section. Extensions shall state an expiration date by which an applicant shall obtain a final
inspection approval for the project from the Planning & Building Director. The inspection
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 470/578
requirements set forth in Section 105.5 (excepting those pertaining to final inspections) shall
apply to all permits extended pursuant to this section. The expiration date in the extension shall
control for final inspections.
A decision by the Planning & Building Director to deny a request for an extension due to an
absence of justifiable cause shall be evidenced by a dated and signed Notice of Denial, which
shall be served on the applicant by first class mail. The date the Notice of Denial is placed in a
U.S. Postal container shall constitute the date of service. An applicant may challenge a Notice of
Denial by tendering a dated and signed appeal containing the grounds therefor, as well as the
applicant's mailing address and contact information by telephone and email (if available) to the
City Clerk's Office within ten (10) calendar days of the date of service of a Notice of Denial. The
City Clerk's Office must receive the appeal within the appeal period. An appeal fee shall not be
charged. An untimely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal, in which case the Notice
of Denial shall be final.
If an appeal is timely filed, then an informal hearing shall be scheduled to occur before the City
Manager, or a designee thereof having no involvement in the appealed decision. A timely appeal
stays a Notice of Denial. The hearing shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days of the City
Clerk's receipt of a timely appeal. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The
applicant and the Planning & Building Department shall have the opportunity to present evidence
in support of their respective positions and to cross-examine witnesses. The applicant bears the
burden of proof at the appeal hearing to establish justifiable cause existed for an extension and
that it was timely made. The hearing officer shall use preponderance of evidence as the
standard of review in deciding the issue on appeal.
The City shall issue a notice to the applicant by first class mail of the date, time and place of the
hearing, which notice shall be deposited in a United States postal container no less than ten (10)
calendar days prior thereto. Failure of any person to receive a properly addressed notice
pursuant to this section shall not affect any appeal hearing pursuant to this section.
Failure of an applicant to appear at an appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal,
in which case the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing. In that event a Notice of Denial is final.
The hearing officer shall, within ten (10) calendar days of the hearing issue a written notice of
decision to the applicant by first class mail that: (i) upholds the Notice of Denial or, (ii) reverses
the Notice of Denial, in which case the Planning & Building Director shall issue an extension in
the manner provided for in this section. The notice of decision shall include findings in support
thereof. The hearing officer's decision shall be final.
Payment of fees. 50% of current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained
incomplete for a period of less than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit. 100% of
current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained incomplete for a period of
more than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit.
105.5.2 Incomplete Structure - Maintenance.
An incomplete structure constitutes a public nuisance and a violation of the San Marino
Municipal Code. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor offense for any owner or other
responsible person to own, use, occupy or maintain an incomplete structure.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 471/578
105.5.3 Incomplete Structure - New or Renewed Permit.
Applicants shall obtain a new building permit or renew a previously expired building permit for an
incomplete structure before undertaking any actions that are regulated by this chapter in
connection with that structure. Requirements for that permit shall include one or more of the
following actions as determined in each instance by the Planning & Building Director:
(i) Inspection. Applicants shall tender a special inspection fee to the City when the Planning &
Building Director requires an inspection of the project to verify prior compliance with
regulations in Chapter 25 of the San Marino Municipal Code, or because of the amount of time
that has passed from the last successful inspection, or from the expiration date of the original
building permit. The amount of the fee shall be established by City Council resolution.
(ii) Tender of new plans, specifications, and other required submittals. The Planning & Building
Director may require applicants to tender new plans, specifications, and other required
submittals if new laws that are applicable to the project have taken effect in the City after the
issuance of a building permit for a project, but before a renewed or new permit is issued.
(iii) Payment of fees. 50% of current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained
incomplete for a period of less than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit. 100% of
current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained incomplete for a period of
more than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit.
New or renewed building permits for an incomplete structure are subject to expiration pursuant
to Subsection 105.5.4.
105.5.3.1 Incomplete Structure - Additional Requirements.
Applicants are, in addition to the requirements in Section 105.5.3, also subject to the following
regulations:
(i) Construction Plan. Applicants shall, as a prerequisite to obtaining a building permit, obtain
written approval from the Planning & Building Director of a construction plan that contains all
of the following information:
(a) A detailed description of the remaining work to be done for the project, organized
chronologically.
(b) The dates by which the applicant stipulates and agrees to obtain each required
successful progress inspection for the project from the Planning & Building Director and,
when applicable, from the Fire Department.
(c) The date by which the applicant stipulates and agrees to undergo a final progress
inspection for the project from the Planning & Building Director.
(ii) Planning & Building Director Approval. The Planning & Building Director shall approve the
construction plan in writing unless he or she finds:
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 472/578
(a) The plan does not contain all of the required information and is deemed incomplete.
(b) A complete plan does not comply with the time limitations set forth in Section 105.5.4,
which is applicable to permits issued to bring an unpermitted structure (including an
incomplete structure) into compliance with the regulations of this chapter.
(c) An applicant has failed to fully comply with Subpart (iii) (Security).
(iii) Security. Applicants shall, concurrently with the submittal of a construction plan, tender to
the City Clerk a surety bond or a corporate surety bond or a deposit of money, a certificate of
deposit, a letter of credit or other security that is acceptable to the City Attorney for the
purpose of guaranteeing the faithful and timely performance of the construction plan. The
required security shall be equal to the estimated costs plus ten percent (10%) of the work to
be performed (as determined by the Planning & Building Director) in order to complete the
project. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes cause to deny the issuance of a
permit under Articles 2 through 6 and Article 12 of chapter XXV of the San Marino Municipal
Code.
(iv) Appeal. A decision by the Planning & Building Director to not approve a construction plan
shall be evidenced by a dated and signed Notice of Disapproval of Proposed Construction
Plan (hereafter, a "Notice of Disapproval"), which shall be served on the applicant by first class
mail. The date the Notice of Disapproval is placed in a U.S. Postal container shall constitute
the date of service. An applicant may challenge a Notice of Disapproval by tendering a dated
and signed appeal containing the grounds therefor, as well as the applicant's mailing address
and contact information by telephone and email (if available) to the City Clerk's Office within
ten (10) calendar days of the date of service of the Notice of Disapproval. The City Clerk's
Office must receive the appeal within the appeal period. An appeal fee shall not be charged.
An untimely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal, in which case the Notice of
Disapproval shall be final.
If an appeal is timely filed, then an informal hearing shall be scheduled to occur before the City
Manager, or a designee thereof having no involvement in the appealed decision. A timely
appeal stays a Notice of Disapproval. The hearing shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days
of the City Clerk's receipt of a timely appeal. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not
apply. The applicant and the Planning & Building Department shall have the opportunity to
present evidence in support of their respective positions and to cross-examine witnesses. The
applicant bears the burden of proof at the appeal hearing to establish the requirements for
approval of a construction plan were met. The hearing officer shall use preponderance of
evidence as the standard of review in deciding the issue on appeal.
The City shall issue a notice to the applicant by first class mail of the date, time and place of
the hearing, which notice shall be deposited in a United States postal container no less than
ten (10) calendar days prior thereto. Failure of any person to receive a properly addressed
notice pursuant to this section shall not affect any appeal hearing pursuant to this section.
Failure of an applicant to appear at an appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to
appeal, in which case the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing. In that event a Notice of
Disapproval is final.
The hearing officer shall, within ten (10) calendar days of the hearing issue a written notice of
decision to the applicant by first class mail that: (i) upholds the Notice of Disapproval or, (ii)
reverses the Notice of Disapproval, in which case the Planning & Building Director shall
approve the construction plan. The notice of decision shall include findings in support thereof.
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

The hearing officer's decision shall be final.
105.5.3.2 Consequence for Violating a Construction Plan.
(i) Projects that are subject to an approved construction plan and that do not receive all timely
successful progress and final inspection approvals, shall, upon the first instance of an
unsuccessful inspection date in the approved construction plan, result in the applicable building
and/or other permits under this chapter automatically expiring by limitation and becoming null
and void, unless the applicant has applied for and obtained the Planning & Building Director's
prior written approval of a modified construction plan in accordance with subsection (ii) below.
Structures for which a building and/or other permits under this chapter have expired as a result
of a violation of a construction plan, or a modified construction plan, are incomplete and subject
to Section 105.5.2.
(ii) The Planning & Building Director may modify an approved construction plan in writing (and
extend the corresponding permit pursuant to Section 105.5.4) upon written request of the
applicant that demonstrates cause for the modification. The modification, or an aggregate of
modifications, shall not extend the date by which final approval must be obtained by more than
90 calendar days.
(iii) A decision by the Planning & Building Director to disapprove a proposed modification to an
approved construction plan due to the absence of cause shall be evidenced by a dated and
signed Notice of Disapproval of Proposed Modification (hereafter, a "Notice of Disapproval"),
which shall be served on the applicant by first class mail. The regulations in Section 105.5.3.1
(iv) that pertain to appeals shall apply to a Notice of Disapproval that is issued pursuant to this
Subpart (iii).
105.5.4 Expiration of Permit - Incomplete or Unpermitted Structure.
A building permit that is issued to bring an unpermitted structure (including an incomplete
structure) into compliance with regulations in this chapter shall be subject to the following
provisions, regardless of the project's valuation:
Every such permit shall automatically expire by limitation and become null and void:
(i) 30 calendar days after the issuance date of the permit if the project has not received a
successful inspection from the Planning & Building Director; or
(ii) 90 calendar days after the issuance date of the permit if the project has not received a final
inspection approval from the Planning & Building Director.
The Planning & Building Director may extend the expiration date of a building permit that is
issued pursuant to this section for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days on a written request
that is received by the Planning & Building Director prior to the permit's expiration date. A fee in
a sum established by City Council resolution shall accompany the request, which is not
refundable in the event the request is denied. The written request shall demonstrate justifiable
cause for the extension. The Planning & Building Director shall date and sign extensions that are
approved pursuant to this section. Extensions shall state an expiration date by which an
applicant shall obtain a final inspection approval from a building inspector for the project.

R105.5.1 Extension of Permit - Prior to Expiration.
The Planning & Building Director may extend the expiration date of a building permit for a period
not exceeding 180 calendar days upon a written request from the applicant that is received by
the Planning & Building Director prior to the permit's expiration date. A fee in a sum established
by City Council resolution shall accompany the request, which is not refundable in the event the
request is denied. The written request shall demonstrate justifiable cause for the extension. The
Planning & Building Director shall date and sign extensions that are approved pursuant to this
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 481/578
section. Extensions shall state an expiration date by which an applicant shall obtain a final
inspection approval for the project from a building inspector. The inspection requirements set
forth in Section R105.5 (excepting those pertaining to final inspections) shall apply to all permits
extended pursuant to this section. The expiration date in the extension shall control for final
inspections.
A decision by the Planning & Building Director to deny a request for an extension due to an
absence of justifiable cause shall be evidenced by a dated and signed Notice of Denial, which
shall be served on the applicant by first class mail. The date the Notice of Denial is placed in a
U.S. Postal container shall constitute the date of service. An applicant may challenge a Notice of
Denial by tendering a dated and signed appeal containing the grounds therefor, as well as the
applicant's mailing address and contact information by telephone and email (if available) to the
City Clerk's Office within ten (10) calendar days of the date of service of the Notice of Denial.
The City Clerk's Office must receive the appeal within the appeal period. An appeal fee shall not
be charged. An untimely appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal, in which case the
Notice of Denial shall be final.
If an appeal is timely filed, then an informal hearing shall be scheduled to occur before the City
Manager, or a designee thereof having no involvement in the appealed decision. A timely appeal
stays a Notice of Denial. The hearing shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days of the City
Clerk's receipt of a timely appeal. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The
applicant and the Planning & Building Department shall have the opportunity to present evidence
in support of their respective positions and to cross-examine witnesses. The applicant bears the
burden of proof at the appeal hearing to establish justifiable cause existed for an extension and
that it was timely made. The hearing officer shall use preponderance of evidence as the
standard of review in deciding the issue on appeal.
The City shall issue a notice to the applicant by first class mail of the date, time and place of the
hearing, which notice shall be deposited in a United States postal container no less than ten (10)
calendar days prior thereto. Failure of any person to receive a properly addressed notice
pursuant to this section shall not affect any appeal hearing pursuant to this section.
Failure of an applicant to appear at an appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal,
in which case the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing. In that event a Notice of Denial is final.
The hearing officer shall, within ten (10) calendar days of the hearing issue a written notice of
decision to the applicant by first class mail that: (i) upholds the Notice of Denial or, (ii) reverses
the Notice of Denial, in which case the Planning & Building Director shall issue an extension in
the manner provided for in this section. The notice of decision shall include findings in support
thereof. The hearing officer's decision shall be final.
R105.5.2 Incomplete Structure - Maintenance.
An incomplete structure constitutes a public nuisance and a violation of the San Marino
Municipal Code. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor offense for any owner or other
responsible person to own, use, occupy or maintain an incomplete structure.

Applicants shall obtain a new building permit or renew a previously expired building permit for an
incomplete structure before undertaking any actions that are regulated by this chapter in
connection with that structure. Requirements for that permit shall include one or more of the
following actions as determined in each instance by the Planning & Building Director:
(i) Inspection. Applicants shall tender a special inspection fee to the City when the Planning &
Building Director requires an inspection of the project to verify prior compliance with
regulations in Chapter 25 of the San Marino Municipal Code, or because of the amount of time
that has passed from the last successful inspection, or from the expiration date of the original
building permit. The amount of the fee shall be established by City Council resolution.
(ii) Tender of new plans, specifications, and other required submittals. The Planning & Building
Director may require applicants to tender new plans, specifications, and other required
submittals if new laws that are applicable to the project have taken effect in the City after the
issuance of a building permit for a project, but before a renewed or new permit is issued.
(iii) Payment of fees. 50% of current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained
incomplete for a period of less than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit. 100% of
current permit fees shall be due for a structure that has remained incomplete for a period of
more than 6 months from the expiration date of a permit.
New or renewed building permits for an incomplete structure are subject to expiration pursuant
to Subsection R105.5.4.
R105.5.3.1 Incomplete Structure - Additional Requirements.
Applicants are, in addition to the requirements in Section R105.5.3, also subject to the following
regulations:

written approval from the Planning & Building Director of a construction plan that contains all
of the following information:

chronologically.
(b) The dates by which the applicant stipulates and agrees to obtain each required
successful progress inspection for the project from the Planning & Building Director and,

which is applicable to permits issued to bring an unpermitted structure (including an
incomplete structure) into compliance with the regulations in this chapter.

the City Clerk a surety bond or a corporate surety bond or a deposit of money, a certificate of
deposit, a letter of credit or other security that is acceptable to the City Attorney for the
purpose of guaranteeing the faithful and timely performance of the construction plan. The
required security shall be equal to the estimated costs plus ten percent (10%) of the work to
be performed (as determined by the Planning & Building Director) in order to complete the
project. Failure to comply with this requirement constitutes cause to deny the issuance of a
permit under Articles 3 through 6 and Article 12 of chapter XXV of the San Marino Municipal
Code.
(iv) Appeal. A decision by the Planning & Building Director to not approve a construction plan
shall be evidenced by a dated and signed Notice of Disapproval of Proposed Construction
Plan (hereafter, a "Notice of Disapproval"), which shall be served on the applicant by first class
mail. The date the Notice of Disapproval is placed in a U.S. Postal container shall constitute
the date of service. An applicant may challenge a Notice of Disapproval by tendering a dated
and signed appeal containing the grounds therefor, as well as the applicant's mailing address
and contact information by telephone and email (if available) to the City Clerk's Office within
ten (10) calendar days of the date of service of the Notice of Disapproval. The City Clerk's
Office must receive the appeal within the appeal period. An appeal fee shall not be charged.

Disapproval shall be final.
If an appeal is timely filed, then an informal hearing shall be scheduled to occur before the City
Manager, or a designee thereof having no involvement in the appealed decision. A timely
appeal stays a Notice of Disapproval. The hearing shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days
of the City Clerk's receipt of a timely appeal. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not
apply. The applicant and the Planning & Building Department shall have the opportunity to
present evidence in support of their respective positions and to cross-examine witnesses. The
applicant bears the burden of proof at the appeal hearing to establish the requirements for
approval of a construction plan were met. The hearing officer shall use preponderance of
evidence as the standard of review in deciding the issue on appeal.
The City shall issue a notice to the applicant by first class mail of the date, time and place of
the hearing, which notice shall be deposited in a United States postal container no less than
ten (10) calendar days prior thereto. Failure of any person to receive a properly addressed
notice pursuant to this section shall not affect any appeal hearing pursuant to this section.
Failure of an applicant to appear at an appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to
appeal, in which case the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing. In that event a Notice of
Disapproval is final.
The hearing officer shall, within ten (10) calendar days of the hearing issue a written notice of
decision to the applicant by first class mail that: (i) upholds the Notice of Disapproval or, (ii)
reverses the Notice of Disapproval, in which case the Planning & Building Director shall
approve the construction plan. The notice of decision shall include findings in support thereof.

successful progress and final inspection approvals, shall, upon the first instance of an
unsuccessful inspection date in the approved construction plan, result in the applicable building

and void, unless the applicant has applied for and obtained the Planning & Building Director's
prior written approval of a modified construction plan in accordance with subsection (ii) below.

The City Clerk's Office must receive the appeal within the appeal period. An appeal fee shall not

Clerk's receipt of a timely appeal. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The
applicant and the Planning & Building Department shall have the opportunity to present evidence
in support of their respective positions and to cross-examine witnesses. The applicant bears the
burden of proof at the appeal hearing to establish justifiable cause existed for an extension and
that it was timely made. The hearing officer shall use preponderance of evidence as the
standard of review in deciding the issue on appeal.
The City shall issue a notice to the applicant by first class mail of the date, time and place of the
hearing, which notice shall be deposited in a United States postal container no less than ten (10)
calendar days prior thereto. Failure of any person to receive a properly addressed notice
pursuant to this section shall not affect any appeal hearing pursuant to this section.
Failure of an applicant to appear at an appeal hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal,
in which case the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing. In that event a Notice of Denial is final.
The hearing officer shall, within ten (10) calendar days of the hearing issue a written notice of
decision to the applicant by first class mail that: (i) upholds the Notice of Denial or, (ii) reverses
the Notice of Denial, in which case the Planning & Building Director shall issue an extension in
the manner provided for in this section. The notice of decision shall include findings in support
thereof. The hearing officer's decision shall be final.

review fee shall be paid at the time of submitting plans and specifications for review. The plan
review fees for electrical work shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the total permit fee
as established by resolution of the city council. The plan review fees specified in this subsection

permit may be issued for such work.
D. Investigation Fee: An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or
not a permit fee is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount
of the permit fee that would be required by the city code if a permit were to be issued. The
payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other
provisions of the electrical code nor from any penalty prescribed by law.

erroneously paid or collected. The building official may authorize the refunding of not more than
eighty percent (80%) of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in
accordance with the Electrical Code. The Planning and Building Department shall not authorize
refunding of any fee paid except upon written application filed by the original permittee not later

percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
BASE FLOOD: A flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this article.
BUILDING: Any structure.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not
limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling

normally dry land areas from: the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid
accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are
proximately caused by flooding as defined herein and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on
the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited
along the path of the current; or
B. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical
levels or suddenly caused by an unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as
defined in this definition.

Code to read as follows:
Section 4908
Clearance Of Hazardous Vegetation From Structures And Roads Within The City Of San
Marino.
4908.1 Statement Of Legislative Intent And Purpose. It is the objective of this section to
promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare by recognizing that there exists
within the city of San Marino a potentially hazardous fire situation created by grass, weeds,
shrubs, and trees which are in such condition and location as to provide a ready fuel supply to
augment the spread or intensity of fire. It is the intent of this section to provide minimum
standards to safeguard life, safety, property and the public welfare by insuring that hazardous
vegetation or refuse is removed and that all grass, weeds, shrubs, and trees are properly
maintained so as to not create a fire hazard within the community, while maintaining sufficient
vegetation for aesthetic and soil erosion control purposes.
It is the further intent that this section apply on a year-round basis to insure the removal and/or
proper maintenance of grass, weeds, shrubs, trees and refuse in order to prevent the spread
or intensity of fire within the community. Of particular concern is the need to provide adequate
defensible space in the urban/wildland interface area of the city, referred to as the high fire
hazard severity zone. For purposes of this section, defensible space is that space within 100
feet (30.480 m) of a building or structure that is required for access by fire and other
emergency personnel to defend the building or structure from the threat of fire.
4908.2 Prohibition. No person who has any ownership or possessory interest in, or control of
a parcel of land shall allow to exist thereon any hazardous refuse or hazardous grass, weeds,
shrubs, trees, or other vegetation, which, by reason of proximity to a building or structure,
constitutes a fire hazard. For purposes of this section, hazardous grass, weeds, shrubs, trees,
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 514/578
or other vegetation are defined as grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or other vegetation which are
in such condition and location, or by the unique characteristics of a species, as to provide a
ready fuel supply to augment the spread or intensity of a fire.
4908.3 Specific Requirements. In order to provide sufficient defensible space, each person
who has any ownership or possessory interest in, or control of, a parcel of land shall:
4908.3.1 General. Remove from the property all hazardous vegetation, except as otherwise
provided herein, if such vegetation is within 100 feet (30.480 m) of a building, within ten (10)
feet (3.048 m) of a combustible fence, or within ten (10) feet (3.048 m) of any portion of any
highway, street, alley, or driveway improved or used for vehicular travel or other vehicular
purposes. Distances up to 200 feet (60.960 m) or greater from a building or structure may
be necessary as determined by the chief. This requirement does not apply to the
maintenance of trees, ornamental shrubbery or plants which are used as ground cover,
provided such are landscape materials that are properly irrigated and maintained and do not
provide a ready fuel supply to augment the spread or intensity of a fire.
4908.3.2 Adjacent To Building. Keep all trees, shrubs, and other vegetation or portions
thereof, adjacent to or overhanging any building or structure free of dead limbs, branches,
and other combustible matter.
4908.3.3 Roof Clearance. Maintain 5 feet (1.524 m) of vertical clearance between roof
surfaces and portions of trees or shrubs overhanging any building or structure.
4908.3.4 Chimney Clearance. Remove any portion of a tree or shrub which extends within
15 feet (4.572 m) of the outlet of a chimney or stovepipe.
4908.3.5 Roof Surface. Maintain the roofs of all buildings or structures free of leaves,
needles, twigs, and other combustible matter.
4908.3.6 Building Clearance--30 Feet. Maintain all hazardous grass, weeds, and small
shrubs within 30 feet (9.144 m) of any building or structure. Hazardous vegetation must be
maintained less than 3 inches (76 mm) high; cut grass may be left on the slope to protect
the soil if it lays down within 3 inches (76 mm) of the ground. Large native shrubs may be
retained no closer than an average of 18 feet (5.486 m) apart, provided the lower branches
have been trimmed a minimum of 3 feet (914 mm) above the ground, or at least thinned to
reduce the available fuel volume.
4908.3.7 Roads. Maintain trees and shrubs within 10 feet of that portion of any highway,
street, alley, or driveway which is improved or used for vehicle travel or other vehicular
purposes (except for designated fire roads), so that no leafy foliage, twigs, or branches are
within six (6) feet (1.828 m) of the ground (but no more than 1/3 of the crown).
4908.3.8 Combustible Fences. Maintain all hazardous grass, weeds and other vegetation
located within 10 feet (3.048 m) of any combustible fence at a height of not more than 3
inches (76 mm). This shall not require the removal of trees, ornamental shrubbery or plants
which are used as ground cover, provided such do not provide a ready fuel supply to
augment the spread or intensity of a fire.
4908.3.9 Building Clearance--100 Feet. Maintain all hazardous grass, weeds, shrubs and
trees within 100 feet (30.480 m) of any building or structure. Grass and small shrubs may be
retained on steep slopes to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion, but may not exceed a
height of 18 inches (457 mm). Large native specimen shrubs should be retained where
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 515/578
possible, but no closer than an average of 18 feet (5.486 m) apart. Remove all dead foliage,
twigs or branches, or live branches within 3 feet (914 mm) of the ground, from mature trees
and shrubs (but no more than 1/3 of the crown).
4908.3.10 Cut Vegetation And Refuse. Remove and/or safely dispose of all cut vegetation
and hazardous refuse.
4908.3.11 Soil Erosion Control. If the abatement of hazardous vegetation results in the
exposure of bare mineral soil, or the soil is exposed to such an extent that increased soil
erosion would be likely, or the chief or his designee determines that the abatement has
been excessive and poses a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, irrigation and
landscaping or a suitable erosion control structure must be provided to establish effective
soil erosion control.
4908.3.12 Minimum Requirements. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to
preclude the chief from requiring more than the minimum specific requirements set forth
above when the chief determines that conditions exist which necessitate greater fire
protection measures.
4908.4 Notice. The council finds that grass, weeds, shrubs, trees, or other vegetation prohibited
under sec. 4908.3 increase the danger of fire and thus constitute a public nuisance. If such
condition exists, the San Marino fire department shall give notice to the owner of record to abate
the nuisance within 30 days. The notice shall state that the owner is required to abate the
nuisance and that if the nuisance is not abated the city may take further action which can
include, (1) the city, or its contractor, may enter upon the parcel of land and remove or otherwise
eliminate or abate the nuisance, (2) that upon completion of such work the cost thereof,
including administrative costs, shall become a special assessment against that parcel, and (3)
that upon council confirmation of the assessment and recordation of that order, a lien shall
attach to the parcel to be collected on the next regular property tax bill levied against the parcel.

The City Council hereby declares that this Article is adopted to achieve the following, among others,
purposes and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:
A. To adopt a sales and use tax which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in part
1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
B. To adopt a sales and use tax which incorporates provisions identical to those of the sales and use
tax law of the State1 insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.
C. To adopt a sales and use tax which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be
administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as
fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and
administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and
collecting the California State sales and use taxes.
D. To adopt a sales and use tax which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree
possible consistent with the provisions of part 1.5 of division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code,
minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of
this Article. (1990 Revs.)

City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall
nevertheless so contract, and in such a case, the operative date shall be the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the initial adoption of this Article. (1990 Revs.)

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all

such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and use

delivering, use or enjoyment of "video programming" (including origination programming and
programming using internet protocol, e.g., IP-TV, IP-video, and over the top TV or OTT) by a "video
service supplier", regardless of the technology used to deliver, store or provide such services, and
regardless of the manner or basis on which such services are calculated or billed, and includes
ancillary video services, data services, "telecommunication services", or interactive communication
services that are functionally integrated with "video services". (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-

26.03.03: EXEMPTIONS:
A. The taxes imposed by this article shall not apply to:
1. Any person or service if imposition of such tax upon that person or service would be in violation
of a federal or state statute or the constitution of the state of California, or the constitution of the
United States; or
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

2. The city, and the state of California and its subdivisions.
3. Accredited schools and churches.
B. Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this article pursuant to subsection A of this
section shall file an application with the tax administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this
requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a
commonly recognized name for such service. Said application shall be made upon a form
approved by the tax administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury,
which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all service suppliers
serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the tax administrator, such service user shall give
the tax administrator timely written notice of any change in service suppliers so that the tax
administrator can properly notify the new service supplier of the service user's tax exempt status. A
service user that fails to apply and obtain an exemption pursuant to this section shall not be
entitled to a refund of a users tax collected and remitted to the tax administrator from such service
user as a result of such noncompliance.
C. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed pursuant to section 26.03.20 of this article.
Filing an application with the tax administrator and appeal to the city manager, or designee,
pursuant to section 26.03.20 of this article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
D. The city council may, by resolution, establish one or more classes of persons or one or more
classes of utility service otherwise subject to payment of a tax imposed by this article and provide
that such classes of persons or service shall be exempt, in whole or in part from such tax for a
specified period of time. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)

A. There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the city using telecommunication services. The
tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of the charges made for such
services and shall be collected from the service user by the telecommunication services supplier or
its billing agent, or as otherwise provided by law. There is a rebuttable presumption that
telecommunication services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in
whole or in part, within the city's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this
section. There is also a rebuttable presumption that prepaid telecommunication services sold
within the city are primarily used, in whole or in part, within the city and are therefore subject to
taxation under this section. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service
address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As
used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits,
property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange
for the telecommunication services.
B. "Mobile telecommunications service" shall be sourced in accordance with the sourcing rules set
forth in the mobile telecommunications sourcing act (4 USC section 124). The tax administrator
may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax
collection requirements of this section, sourcing rules for the taxation of other telecommunication
services, including, but not limited to, postpaid telecommunication services, prepaid
telecommunication services, and private telecommunication services, provided that such rules are
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 530/578
based upon custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize
multijurisdictional taxation.
C. The tax administrator may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which
are subject to the tax collection requirements of this section, an administrative ruling identifying
those telecommunication services, or charges therefor, that is subject to the tax of subsection A of
this section. This administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax
methodology as stated in this section, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California
Government Code section 53750(h)(2)(A).
D. As used in this section, the term "telecommunication services" shall include, but is not limited to,
charges for: connection, reconnection, termination or early termination charges; movement or
change of telecommunication services; late payment fees; detailed billing; central office and
custom calling features (including, but not limited to, call waiting, call forwarding, caller
identification and three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging services; directory

charges or surcharges, including charges or surcharges for programs imposed by state or federal
law (whether such charges or surcharges are imposed on the service supplier or the customer);
local number portability charges; and text and instant messaging. "Telecommunication services"
shall not include digital downloads that are not "ancillary telecommunication services", such as
music, ringtones, games, and similar digital products.
E. To prevent actual multijurisdictional taxation of telecommunication services subject to tax under this
section, any service user, upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user has previously
paid the same tax in another state or city on such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other
state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city
under this section.
F. The tax on telecommunication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service
user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax
administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twentieth day of the
following month.

service which originates within a combat zone from a member of the armed forces of the United
States performing service in such combat zone, as determined under such section, provided a
certificate, setting forth such facts as the tax administrator may by regulations prescribe, is
furnished to the person receiving such payment. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.05: VIDEO USER TAX:
A. There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the city using video services from a video
provider. The tax imposed by this subsection shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of the
charges made for such services, and shall be collected from the service user by the video service
supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that video services, which are billed
to a billing or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part, within the city's boundaries,
and such services are subject to taxation under this article. If the billing address of the service user
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 531/578

2. Initial installation of equipment necessary for provision and receipt of video services;
3. Late fees, collection fees, bad debt recoveries, and return check fees;
4. Activation fees, reactivation fees; termination or early termination charges; and reconnection
fees;

or common to the use or enjoyment of the video services);
7. Equipment leases (e.g., remote, set box, recording and/or search devices; converters); and
8. Service calls, service protection plans, name changes, changes of services, and special
services.
C. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits,
property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange
for the video services.

the tax collection requirements of this article, an administrative ruling identifying those video
services, or charges therefor, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection A of this
section.
E. The tax imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the video service
supplier, its billing agent, or a reseller of such services. In the case of video service, the service
user shall be deemed to be the purchaser of the bulk video service (e.g., an apartment owner),
unless such service is resold to individual users, in which case the service user shall be the
ultimate purchaser of the video service. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted
to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twentieth
day of the following month. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.06: ELECTRICITY USER TAX:
A. There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using electricity in the city. The tax imposed by
this section shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of the charges made for such electricity, and for
any supplemental services or other associated activities directly related to and/or necessary for the
provision of electricity to the service user, which are provided by a service supplier or nonutility

service supplier to a service user. The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service
supplier or nonutility service supplier, or its billing agent.
B. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items that
are: 1) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of electric service; or 2) currently,
or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local
distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges" shall include, but is not
limited to, the following charges:
1. Energy charges;

the customer.
C. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits,
property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange
for the electricity or services related to the provision of such electricity.
D. The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the electric service suppliers to identify the
various unbundled billing components of electric retail service that they commonly provide to

such electric service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric
service providers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: 1)
necessary or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or 2) currently, or
historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution
company to a class of retail customers. Unbundled charges for such components and items shall
be subject to the tax of subsection A of this section.

receiving of such electricity by an electric public utility or governmental agency at a point within the
city for resale, or the use of such energy in the production or distribution of water by a public utility
or a governmental agency.

from the service user by the electric service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax
collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax
administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month; or, at the option of the person
required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax
measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user,
which must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twentieth day of following month,
provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as
appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the
tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. (Ord. 0-15-
1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.07: GAS USER TAX:
A. There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using gas in the city, which is delivered through a
pipeline distribution system or by mobile transport. The tax imposed by this section shall be at the
rate of five percent (5%) of the charges made for such gas, including all services related to the
storage, transportation and delivery of such gas. The tax shall be collected from the service user
by the service supplier or nonutility service supplier, or its billing agent, and shall apply to all uses
of gas, including, but not limited to, heating, electric generation by a nonpublic utility, and the use

residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including
those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing

suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: 1) necessary
or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or 2) currently, or historically have
been, included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class
of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of
subsection A of this section.

applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-
2017)
26.03.08: SERVICE USERS RECEIVING DIRECT PURCHASE OF GAS OR
ELECTRICITY:
A. Any service user subject to the tax imposed by section 26.03.06 or 26.03.07 of this article, which
produces gas or electricity for self-use; which receives gas or electricity, including any related
supplemental services, directly from a nonutility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this
article; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service
supplier, a nonutility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the city,
including any related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the tax administrator and shall
remit the tax due directly to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of
paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the tax administrator within thirty
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 535/578
(30) days for such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous

request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit,
if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes
due.
B. The tax administrator may require said service user to identify its nonutility service supplier and
provide, subject to audit, invoices, books of account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting
the quantity of gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or
price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or, if the
administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the tax administrator is excessive, the tax
administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service
user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services,
had been provided by the service supplier that is the primary supplier of gas or electricity within the
city. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)

C. As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits,
property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange
for the water services.
D. The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the water service suppliers in the city to
identify the various unbundled billing components of water retail service that they commonly
provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor,
including those items that are mandated by a water district or a state or federal agency as a
condition of providing such water service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and
disseminate to such water service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components
and items which are: 1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service;
or 2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 536/578
a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and

26.03.10: EFFECT OF COMMINGLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NONTAXABLE
ITEMS:
If any nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable service charges
on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the
service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined
charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier's books and records kept in the
regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not
created and maintained for tax purposes. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and
nontaxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values
assigned the taxable and nontaxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the
regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not
created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper
valuation and apportionment of taxable and nontaxable charges. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-
2017)
26.03.11: SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS:
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this article,
"substantial nexus", "substantial economic presence", and "minimum contacts" shall be construed
broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility user tax to the fullest extent
permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or
by statutory enactment. Any telecommunication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a
service address in the city, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the
general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial
nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and
remit a tax, under this article. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the city
for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the
following: maintains or has within the city, directly or through an agent, affiliate or subsidiary, a place of
business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent contractors, resellers,
agents, affiliates or other representatives; solicits business in the city on a continuous, regular,
seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter
with the city or distributed from a location with the city; or advertises in newspapers or other
periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials distributed in the city by means
other than the United States mail; or if there are activities performed in the city on behalf of the service
supplier that are significantly associated with the service supplier's ability to establish and maintain a
market in the city for the provision of utility services that are subject to a tax under this article (e.g., an
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 537/578
affiliated person engaging in activities in the city that inure to the benefit of the service supplier in its
development or maintenance of a market for its services in the city). (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff.
4-1-2017)
26.03.12: DUTY TO COLLECT; PROCEDURES:
A. Collection By Service Suppliers: The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes
imposed by the provisions of this article shall be performed as follows:
1. The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as practicable at the same time as, and
along with, the collection of the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of
the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than
the full amount of the charge and tax that was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate
share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a
service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges,
section 26.03.15 of this article shall apply.
2. The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the
beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges
normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this article. Where a
person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the
duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

the tax administrator, on forms approved by the tax administrator, on or before the due date. The
full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the tax administrator.
The tax administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems
necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this
article. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to
Revenue And Taxation Code section 7284.6, the tax administrator, and its agents, shall maintain
such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the
public records act. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)

settles into the city's account on the following business day.
B. If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to
properly assess the tax on 1 or more services or charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit
the tax collected on or before the due date, or, in the case of a service user that fails to properly
self-collect and remit the tax under section 26.03.08 of this article on or before the due date, the

required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the tax administrator.

dates and/or penalty and interest provisions of this section to be consistent with any uniform
standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by UUT public agencies, or otherwise
legally established, to create a UUT central payment location or mechanism. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-
3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.14: DEFICIENCY DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT; TAX APPLICATION
ERRORS:
A. The tax administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person
required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this article has failed to pay, collect,
and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more
taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the tax administrator institute
proceedings under this section if, in the opinion of the tax administrator, the cost of collection or
enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.
B. The tax administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to
pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest
at the rate of seventy five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on
the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within
fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in
writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the matter.
C. If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the
deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and
owing to the city. If the person requests a hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to
be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written
request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the tax
administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the tax
administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may
designate the records requested to be produced.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 539/578
D. At the time fixed for the hearing, the tax administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and
evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the tax administrator,
the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the tax
administrator shall issue a final assessment (or nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming,
modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final
assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed
pursuant to section 26.03.20 of this article. Filing an application with the tax administrator and
appeal to the city manager, or designee, pursuant to section 26.03.20 of this article is a
prerequisite to a suit thereon.
E. Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the tax administrator
on or before the thirtieth day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The
penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment,
along with interest at the rate of seventy five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any
fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until
paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax
assessed under this article shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this
subsection.
F. All notices under this article may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed
received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of
mailing. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.15: ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY; NONPAYING SERVICE USERS:
A. Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the
amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to
collect the tax, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she
may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this section from certain
named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the
amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be
relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the
names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions
of this section. Nothing herein shall require that the tax administrator institute proceedings under
this section if, in the opinion of the tax administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely
outweighs the tax benefit.
B. In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen
percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-fourths of one
percent (3/4%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties,
from the due date, until paid.
C. The tax administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the tax administrator has
assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of
such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by
personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 540/578
to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the
tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.
D. If the service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days from the date
of the service of the notice upon him or her, the tax administrator may impose an additional penalty
of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff.
4-1-2017)
26.03.16: ACTIONS TO COLLECT:
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this article shall be deemed a
debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not
been remitted to the tax administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required
to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the
city under the provisions of this article shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for
the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this article, along with
any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person's noncompliance with this article,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees. In the event that a service user or service
supplier owing a tax under this article files bankruptcy, then such debt to the city shall be deemed an
unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 USCA section 507(a)(8)(C). Service suppliers who
seek to collect charges for service in bankruptcy proceedings shall also include in any such claim the
amount of taxes due the city for those services, unless the tax administrator determines that such duty
is in conflict with any federal or state law, rule, or regulation or that such action would be
administratively impractical. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.17: ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR:
A. The tax administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all
of the provisions of this article.
B. The tax administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of
this article for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment,
collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a
new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this article, or increase an existing tax,
except as allowed by California Government Code section 53750(h)(2). A copy of such
administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the tax administrator's office. To the extent
that the tax administrator determines that the tax imposed under this article shall not be collected
in full for any period of time from any particular service supplier or service user, that determination
shall be considered an exercise of the tax administrator's discretion to settle disputes and shall not
constitute a change in taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code section 53750 or
otherwise. The tax administrator is not authorized to amend the city's methodology for purposes of
Government Code section 53750 and the city does not waive or abrogate its ability to impose the
utility users tax in full as a result of promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.
C. Upon a proper showing of good cause, the tax administrator may make administrative agreements,
with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this article and thereby: 1)
conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier (or service user subject to section
26.03.08 of this article) so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 541/578
conformance with the general purpose and scope of this article; or 2) to avoid a hardship where
the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of
each such agreement shall be on file in the tax administrator's office, and are voidable by the tax
administrator or the city at any time.
D. The tax administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of
this article, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this article. The tax
administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud
or other intentional misconduct, the audit period or review shall not exceed a period of three (3)
years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the tax
administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the tax administrator may make a deficiency
determination pursuant to section 26.03.14 of this article for all taxes (and applicable penalties and
interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the tax
administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the tax
administrator to verify compliance with this article, the tax administrator is authorized to make a
reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to be a rebuttable
presumption of correctness.
E. Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the tax administrator may
extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this article for a period of not to
exceed forty five (45) days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already
passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of
such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of three-fourths of one
percent (3/4%) per month, prorated for any portion thereof.
F. The tax administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption
from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this article.
G. The tax administrator, with the written approval of the city manager, may compromise a claim
pursuant to this article where the portion of the claim proposed to be released is equal to or less
than four thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars ($4,999.00); and, with the approval of the city
attorney and the city council, may compromise such a claim where the portion proposed to be
released is greater than four thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars ($4,999.00).
H. Notwithstanding any provision in this article to the contrary, the tax administrator may waive any
penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the
tax imposed by this article if the noncollection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the
noncollection was in good faith, the tax administrator shall take into consideration the uniqueness
of the product or service, industry practice or other precedence, or whether the person offers to
voluntarily disclose its tax liability. The tax administrator may also participate with other utility users
tax public agencies in conducting coordinated compliance reviews with the goal of achieving
administrative efficiency and uniform tax application determinations, where possible. To encourage
voluntary full disclosure and ongoing cooperation on tax collection and remittance, the tax
administrator, and its agents, may enter into agreements with the tax collecting service providers
and grant prospective only effect on any changes regarding the taxation of services or charges that
were previously deemed by the service provider, in good faith and without gross negligence, to be
nontaxable. In determining whether the noncollection was in good faith and without gross
negligence, the tax administrator shall take into consideration the uniqueness of the product or
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 542/578
service, industry practice or other precedence, and whether the disclosure was voluntarily made by
the service provider or its agent. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)
26.03.18: RECORDS:
A. It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by
this article to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be
necessary to determine the amount of such tax that such person may have been liable for the
collection of and remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator shall have
the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
B. The tax administrator may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the
tax administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the tax administrator to establish
compliance with this article, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on
readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and
ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the tax
administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may
provide access to such records outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such
person shall reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect
those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the
normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to conduct the inspection.
C. The tax administrator is authorized to execute a nondisclosure agreement approved by the city
attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue And
Taxation Code sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. The tax administrator may request from a person
providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the city,
a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered, and
other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the city pursuant to section
6354(e) of the California Public Utilities Code.
D. If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the
service supplier shall: 1) provide to the tax administrator the name, address and telephone number
of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill,
collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and 2) upon request of the tax administrator, deliver, or
effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing
aggregator that, in the opinion of the tax administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application,
calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city.
E. If any person subject to recordkeeping under this article unreasonably denies the tax administrator,
or the tax administrator's designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the
information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the tax administrator
may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on such person for each day following: 1)
the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or 2) the due date for production of
records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
penalty imposed under this article. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-2015, eff. 4-1-2017)

thereto.
B. Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection A of this section, the tax administrator may, at
his or her discretion, give written permission to a service supplier, who has collected and remitted
any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this article, to claim credit for such
overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the city upon a subsequent monthly return(s)
to the tax administrator, provided that, prior to taking such credit by the service supplier: 1) such
credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one year from the date of overpayment or
erroneous collection of said tax; 2) the tax administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis and
amount of such credit has been reasonably established; and 3) in the case of an overpayment by a
service user to the service supplier that has been remitted to the city, the tax administrator has
received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the overpayment has been refunded by the service
supplier to the service user in an amount equal to the requested credit. (Ord. 0-15-1295, 11-3-
2015, eff. 4-1-2017)

1. To engage in the business of providing cable service and such other telecommunications
services as may be authorized by law and which grantee elects to provide to its subscribers
within the designated franchise service area.
2. To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain, and retain, cable lines,
related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances, and other property in
connection with the operation of the cable system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across

C. Term Of The Franchise:
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 554/578
1. A franchise granted under this division will be for the term specified in the franchise agreement,
commencing upon the effective date of this ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council
that authorizes the franchise.
2. A franchise granted under this division may be renewed upon application by the grantee in
accordance with the then applicable provisions of state and federal law and this division.
D. Franchise Territory: A franchise is effective within the territorial limits of the city, and within any area
added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or
resolution granting the franchise or in the franchise agreement.
E. Federal Or State Jurisdiction: This division will be construed in a manner consistent with all
applicable federal and state laws, and it applies to all franchises granted or renewed after the
effective date of this article, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
F. Franchise Nontransferable:
1. Grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation, or otherwise, the franchise
or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior written consent of the city
council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the city council,
which consent may not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease,
assign, or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the written consent of the city council is null
and void. The granting of a security interest in any assets of the grantee, or any mortgage or
other hypothecation, will not be deemed a transfer for the purposes of this subsection.
2. The requirements of subsection F1 of this section apply to any change in control of grantee. The
word "control" as used herein is not limited to the ownership of major stockholder or partnership
interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If grantee is a
partnership or a corporation, prior authorization of the city council is required where ownership or
control of twenty five percent (25%) or more of the partnership interests or of the voting stock of
grantee, or any company in the tier of companies controlling the grantee, whether directly or
indirectly, is acquired by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, none of whom,
singularly or collectively, owns or controls those partnership interests or that voting stock of the
grantee, or grantee's upper tier of controlling companies, as of the effective date of the
franchise.
3. Grantee must notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of the grantee's franchise property, or upon the termination of any lease or other interest
covering all or a substantial part of that franchise property. That notification will be considered by
the city as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place, and the
provisions of this subsection F3 that require the prior written consent of the city council to that
change in control of ownership will apply.
4. For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to an acquisition, transfer, or change in
control, the city may inquire as to the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling
party, and grantee must assist the city in that inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change
of ownership or control, grantee or the proposed transferee, or both, must complete federal
communications commission form 394 or its equivalent. This application must be submitted to
the city not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The
transferee must establish that it possesses the legal, financial, and technical capability to
operate and maintain the cable system and to comply with all franchise requirements during the
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 555/578
remaining term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the
proposed transferee are determined to be satisfactory, then the city will consent to the transfer of
the franchise.
5. Any financial institution holding a pledge of the grantee's assets to secure the advance of money
for the construction or operation of the franchise property has the right to notify the city that it, or
a designee satisfactory to the city, will take control of and operate the cable television system
upon grantee's default in its financial obligations. Further, that financial institution must also
submit a plan for such operation within ninety (90) days after assuming control. The plan must
ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the period that
the financial institution will exercise control over the system. The financial institution may not
exercise control over the system for a period exceeding eighteen (18) months unless authorized
by the city, in its sole discretion, and during that period of time it will have the right to petition the
city to transfer the franchise to another grantee.
6. Grantee must reimburse the city for the city's reasonable review and processing expenses
incurred in connection with any transfer or change in control of the franchise. These expenses
may include, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal, and technical
evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all
costs incurred by these experts), notice and publication costs, and document preparation
expenses. The total amount of these reimbursable expenses may be subject to maximum limits
that are specified in the franchise agreement between the city and the grantee. No
reimbursement may be offset against any franchise fee payable to the city during the term of the
franchise.
G. Geographical Coverage:
1. Unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee must design, construct, and
maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit and
commercial building in the franchise service area, subject to any service area line extension
requirements or territorial restrictions set forth in the franchise agreement.
2. After service has been established within all or any part of the franchise service area by
activating trunk or distribution cables, grantee must provide service to any requesting subscriber
within that activated part of the service area within seven (7) days from the date of request,
provided that the grantee is able to secure on reasonable terms and conditions all rights of way
necessary to extend service to that subscriber within that seven (7) day period.
H. Nonexclusive Franchise: Every franchise granted is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the
right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system that it deems
appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law. If an additional franchise is proposed to be
granted to a subsequent grantee, a noticed public hearing must first be held if required by the
provisions of Government Code section 53066.3.
I. Multiple Franchises:
1. The city may grant any number of franchises, subject to applicable state and federal law. The
city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the
requirements of applicable law and the following specific local considerations:
a. The capacity of the public rights of way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the
cables, conduits, and pipes of the existing utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone,
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 556/578
gas, and sewerage.
b. The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as
lower rates and improved service.
c. The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement
for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous
excavations within the public rights of way.
2. The city may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and
the associated costs if, in the city's opinion, the rights of way in any particular area cannot
reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)

2001)
27.03.12: AGREEMENT REQUIRED:
A. No video programming services may be provided in the city by an open video system operator
unless the operator and the city have executed a written agreement, which may be designated as
a franchise, setting forth the terms and conditions under which the operation of the proposed open
video system will be authorized by the city.
B. The agreement between the city and the open video system operator may contain provisions that
relate to the following subject matters, to the extent that such provisions and subject matters are
not preempted by federal law or regulations:
1. The nature, scope, and duration of the agreement, including provisions for its renewal or
extension.
2. The obligation of the open video system operator to pay to the city, at specified times and in lieu
of the franchise fees permitted under section 622 of the communications act, fees on the gross
revenue received by the operator, as authorized by 47 CFR 76.1511, in accordance with the
following standards and procedures:
a. The amount of the fees on the gross revenue will be the maximum amount authorized by
section 653(c)(2)(B) of the communications act, which is the rate imposed by the city on the

gross revenue received by an open video system operator or its affiliates, including all
revenue received from subscribers and all carriage revenue received from unaffiliated video
programming providers; and 2) all advertising revenue received by the operator or its affiliates
in connection with the provision of video programming, where such revenue is included in the
calculation of the cable franchise fee paid to the city by the franchised cable operator. The
term "gross revenue" does not include revenue, such as subscriber or advertising revenue,
collected by unaffiliated video programming providers.
3. The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with requirements relating to
information collection and record keeping, accounting procedures, reporting, periodic audits, and
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 565/578
inspection of records in order to ensure the accuracy of the fees on the gross revenue that are
required to be paid as specified in subsection B2 of this section.
4. The obligation of the open video system operator to meet the city's requirements with respect to
public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, services, facilities, and
equipment, as provided for in 47 CFR 76.1505. In this regard, the following standards and
procedures are applicable:
a. The open video system operator is subject to the same public, educational, and governmental
access requirements that apply within the cable television franchise service area with which its
system overlaps.
b. The open video system operator must ensure that all subscribers receive all public,
educational, and governmental access channels within the franchise service area in which the
city's subscribers are located.
c. The open video system operator may negotiate with the city to establish the operator's
obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity,
services, facilities, and equipment. These negotiations may include the city's franchised cable
operator if the city, the open video system operator, and the franchised cable operator so
desire.
d. If the open video system operator and the city are unable to reach an agreement regarding
the operator's obligations with respect to public, educational, and governmental access
channel capacity, services, facilities, and equipment within the city's jurisdiction, then the
following obligations will be imposed:
(1) The open video system operator must satisfy the same public, educational, and
governmental access obligations as the city's franchised cable operator by providing the
same amount of channel capacity for public, educational, and governmental access and by
matching the city's franchised cable operator's annual financial contributions in support of
public, educational, and governmental access services, facilities, and equipment that are
actually used by the city. For in kind contributions, such as cameras or production studios,
the open video system operator may satisfy its statutory obligation by negotiating mutually
agreeable terms with the city's franchised cable operator, so that public, educational, and
governmental access services to the city are improved or increased. If such terms cannot
be agreed upon, the open video system operator must pay to the city the monetary
equivalent of the franchised cable operator's depreciated in kind contribution, or, in the case
of facilities, the annual amortization value. Any matching contributions provided by the open
video system operator must be used to fund activities arising under section 611 of the
communications act.
(2) The city will impose upon the open video system operator the same rules and procedures
that it imposes upon the franchised cable operator with regard to the open video system
operator's use of channel capacity designated for public, educational, and governmental
access use when that capacity is not being used for such purposes.
e. The city's franchised cable operator is required under federal law to permit the open video
system operator to connect with its public, educational, and governmental access channel
feeds. The open video system operator and the franchised cable operator may decide how to
accomplish this connection, taking into consideration the physical and technical characteristics
of the cable and the open video systems involved. If the franchised cable operator and the
open video system operator cannot agree on how to accomplish the connection, the city has
the right to decide. The city may require that the connection occur on city owned property or
on public rights of way.
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 566/578
f. All costs of connection to the franchised cable operator's public, educational, and
governmental access channel feed must be borne by the open video system operator. These
costs will be counted towards the open video system operator's matching financial
contributions set forth in subsection B4d(1) of this section.
g. The city will not impose upon the open video system operator any public, educational, or
governmental access obligations that are greater than those imposed upon the franchised
cable operator.
h. If there is no existing franchised cable operator, the provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505(d)(6) will be
applicable in determining the obligations of the open video system operator.
(1) The open video system operator must adjust its system to comply with new public,
educational, and access obligations imposed on the city's franchised cable operator
following a renewal of the cable television franchise; provided, however, that the open video
system operator will not be required to displace other programmers using its open video
system to accommodate public, educational, and governmental access channels. The open
video system operator must comply with such new public, educational, and governmental
access obligations whenever additional capacity is or becomes available, whether it is due
to increased channel capacity or to decreased demand for channel capacity.
5. If the city and the open video system operator cannot agree on the application of the FCC's
rules regarding the open video system operator's obligations to provide public, educational, and
governmental access under the provisions of subsection B4 of this section, then either party may
file a complaint with the FCC in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in 47
CFR 76.1514. No agreement will be executed by the city until the dispute has been finally
resolved.
6. If the open video system operator intends to maintain an institutional network, as defined in
section 611(f) of the communications act, the city will require that educational and governmental
access channels be designated on that institutional network to the same extent that those
channels are designated on the institutional network of the city's franchised cable operator.
7. The authority of an open video system operator to exercise editorial control over any public,
educational, or governmental use of channel capacity will be restricted in accordance with the
provisions of 47 CFR 76.1505(f).
8. The obligation of the open video system operator to comply with all applicable federal, state, and
local statutes, ordinances, and regulations relating to customer service standards, including the
cable television and video customer service and information act (Government Code section
53054 et seq.), the video customer service act (Government Code section 53088 et seq.), and
section 27.03.08 of this article.
9. If new physical plant is proposed to be constructed within the city, the obligation of the open
video system operator to comply with the following rights of way use and management
responsibilities that are also imposed by the city upon other cable television and
telecommunications service providers in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner:
a. Compliance with all applicable city codes, including applications for excavation,
encroachment, and construction permits and the payment of all required permit and inspection
fees.
b. The coordination of construction activities.
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 567/578
c. Compliance with established standards and procedures for constructing lines across private
property.
d. Compliance with all applicable insurance and indemnification requirements.
e. The repair and resurfacing of construction damaged streets.
f. Compliance with all public safety requirements that are applicable to cable television and
telecommunications service providers using public property or public rights of way.
10. Acts or omissions constituting breaches or defaults of the agreement, and the applicable
penalties, liquidated damages, and other remedies, including fines or the suspension,
revocation, or termination of the agreement.
11. Requirements relating to the sale, assignment, or transfer of the open video system.
12. Requirements relating to the open video system operator's compliance with and
implementation of state and federal laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to the operation of the
open video system.
13. Such additional requirements, conditions, terms, policies, and procedures as may be mutually
agreed upon by the city and the open video system operator and that will, in the judgment of the
city council, best serve the public interest and protect the public health, welfare, and safety. (Ord.

Division 4. Other Video And Telecommunications
Services And Systems
27.03.13: OTHER MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS:
The term "cable system", as defined in federal law and as set forth in section 27.03.17 of this article,
does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using any public rights of way.
Consequently, the categories of multichannel video programming identified below are not deemed to
be "cable systems" and are therefore exempt from the city's franchise requirements and from certain
other local regulatory provisions authorized by federal law, provided that their distribution or
transmission facilities do not involve the use of the city's public rights of way.
A. Multichannel multipoint distribution service ("MMDS"), also known as "wireless cable", which
typically involves the transmission by an FCC licensed operator of numerous broadcast stations
from a central location using line of sight technology.
B. Local multipoint distribution service ("LMDS"), another form of over the air wireless video service for
which licenses are auctioned by the FCC, and which offers video programming, telephony, and
data networking services.
C. Direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), also referred to as "direct-to-home satellite services", which
involves the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the
subscribers' premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 568/578
subscriber's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Local regulation of direct to home
satellite services is further proscribed by the following federal statutory provisions:
1. 47 USC section 303(v) confers upon the FCC exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of
direct to home satellite services.
2. Section 602 of the telecommunications act of 1996 states that a provider of direct to home
satellite service is exempt from the collection or remittance, or both, of any tax or fee imposed by

27.03.15: TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDED BY TELEPHONE
CORPORATIONS:
A. The city council finds and determines as follows:
1. The federal telecommunications act of 1996 preempts and declares invalid all state rules that
restrict entry or limit competition in both local and long distance telephone service.
2. The California public utilities commission ("CPUC") is primarily responsible for the
implementation of local telephone competition, and it issues certificates of public convenience
and necessity to new entrants that are qualified to provide competitive local telephone exchange
services and related telecommunications service, whether using their own facilities or the
facilities or services provided by other authorized telephone corporations.
3. Section 234(a) of the California Public Utilities Code defines a "telephone corporation" as "every
corporation or person owning, controlling, operating, or managing any telephone line for
compensation within this state".
4. Section 616 of the California Public Utilities Code provides that a telephone corporation "may
condemn any property necessary for the construction and maintenance of its telephone line".
5. Section 2902 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes municipal corporations to retain
their powers of control to supervise and regulate the relationships between a public utility and
the general public in matters affecting the health, convenience, and safety of the general public,
including matters such as the use and repair of public streets by any public utility and the
location of the poles, wires, mains, or conduits of any public utility on, under, or above any public
streets.
6. Section 7901 of the California Public Utilities Code authorizes telephone and telegraph
corporations to construct telephone or telegraph lines along and upon any public road or
highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this state, and to erect poles, posts,
piers, or abutments for supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their
lines, in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or
highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters.
7. Section 7901.1 of the California Public Utilities Code confirms the right of municipalities to
exercise reasonable control as to the time, place, and manner in which roads, highways, and
waterways are accessed, which control must be applied to all entities in an equivalent manner.
Nothing in section 7901.1 adds to or subtracts from any existing authority that municipalities
have with respect to the imposition of fees.
8. Section 50030 of the California Government Code provides that any permit fee imposed by a
city for the placement, installation, repair, or upgrading of telecommunications facilities, such as
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 571/578
lines, poles, or antennas, by a telephone corporation that has obtained all required
authorizations from the CPUC and the FCC to provide telecommunications services, must not
exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service for which the fee is charged, and must not
be levied for general revenue purposes.
B. In recognition of and in compliance with the statutory authorizations and requirements set forth in
subsection A of this section, the following regulatory provisions are applicable to a telephone
corporation that desires to provide telecommunications service by means of facilities that are
proposed to be constructed within the city's public rights of way:
1. The telephone corporation must apply for and obtain, as may be applicable, an excavation
permit, an encroachment permit, or a building permit ("ministerial permit").
2. In addition to the information required by this code in connection with an application for a
ministerial permit, a telephone corporation must submit to the city the following supplemental
information:
a. A copy of the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the CPUC to the
applicant, and a copy of the CPUC decision that authorizes the applicant to provide the
telecommunications service for which the facilities are proposed to be constructed in the city's
public rights of way. Any applicant that, prior to 1996, provided telecommunications service
under administratively equivalent documentation issued by the CPUC may submit copies of
that documentation in lieu of a certificate of public convenience and necessity.
b. If the applicant has obtained from the CPUC a certificate of public convenience and necessity
to operate as a "competitive local carrier", the following additional requirements are applicable:
(1) As required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC, the applicant must establish that it
has timely filed with the city a quarterly report that describes the type of construction and the
location of each construction project proposed to be undertaken in the city during the
calendar quarter in which the application is filed, so that the city can coordinate multiple
projects, as may be necessary.
(2) If the applicant's proposed construction project will extend beyond the utility rights of way
into undisturbed areas or other rights of way, the applicant must establish that it has filed a
petition with the CPUC to amend its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that
the proposed construction project has been subjected to a full scale environmental analysis
by the CPUC, as required by decision no. 95-12-057 of the CPUC.
(3) The applicant must inform the city whether its proposed construction project will be subject
to any of the mitigation measures specified in the negative declaration ("Competitive Local
Carriers (CLCs) Projects for Local Exchange Communication Service throughout
California") or to the mitigation monitoring plan adopted in connection with decision no. 95-
12-057 of the CPUC. The city's issuance of a ministerial permit will be conditioned upon the
applicant's compliance with all applicable mitigation measures and monitoring requirements
imposed by the CPUC upon telephone corporations that are designated as "competitive
local carriers".
c. The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later acquire with respect to the
regulation of any cable or telecommunications service that is provided, or proposed to be
provided, by a telephone corporation. These reserved rights may relate, without limitation, to
the imposition of reasonable conditions in addition to or different from those set forth in this
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 572/578
section, the exaction of a fee or other form of consideration or compensation for use of public
rights of way, and related matters; provided, however, that such regulatory rights and authority
must be consistent with federal and state law that is applicable to cable or telecommunications
services provided by telephone corporations. (Ord. 0-01-1150, 5-9-2001)
Division 5. Use Of Public Rights Of Way
27.03.16: FINDINGS; POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:
A. The city council finds and determines that numerous and repetitive excavations in the public rights
of way diminish the useful life of the surface pavement and generally cause adverse negative
impacts for local residents, local businesses, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The city council
further finds and determines that the utility substructure in the public rights of way is subject to
potential adverse negative impacts as a consequence of new economic and regulatory policies
that foster increased competition between various utility service providers, including telephone
corporations, and between other service providers, such as cable system operators. In order to
mitigate these potential adverse negative impacts, the following policies are adopted:
1. The city manager is directed to develop and to implement public rights of way policies and
procedures that incorporate, to the extent reasonably feasible and consistent with all applicable
laws and regulations, the following requirements that are intended to encourage the shared use
by utility and other service providers of existing facilities in the public rights of way:
a. A requirement that utility and other service providers requesting permits review information
provided by the city that identifies the location of facilities, such as underground conduits, that
are available for shared use, and the owners of those facilities.
b. A requirement that utility and other service providers requesting permits submit a written
statement that describes in reasonable detail the efforts made to obtain from other utility
service providers the right to use excess capacity within existing facilities, and to thereby avoid
the construction of new facilities.
c. A requirement that utility and other service providers occupying the public rights of way submit
annually to the city a map, which may be in a uniform electronic data format to be specified by
the city, that shows the location of their respective facilities in the public rights of way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an updated annual map need not be provided unless there are
changes to the location of the service provider's facilities in the public rights of way.
d. Any additional requirements that will encourage utility and other service providers to share
excess capacity within previously constructed facilities and to coordinate the construction of
new facilities so as to minimize the number of excavations in the public rights of way.
2. The city manager is directed to ensure that all utility and other service providers, including
telephone corporations and cable system operators, comply with all local design, construction,
maintenance and safety standards that are consistent with state and federal laws and
regulations and that are contained within, or are related to, any permit that authorizes the
construction of facilities within the public rights of way, including all applicable insurance
provisions.
3. Based upon the city's projected plans for street construction or renovation projects, the city
manager is authorized to establish on a quarterly basis one or more construction time periods or
"windows" for the installation of facilities within the public rights of way. Cable system operators,
10/24/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=825 573/578
telephone corporations, and other utility service providers that submit applications for permits to
construct facilities after a predetermined date may be required to delay such construction until
the next quarterly "window" that is established by the city.
B. The city council finds and determines that the installation in the public rights of way of numerous
aboveground facilities by utility service providers, including telephone corporations, and other
service providers may create safety hazards and adverse visual impacts. Consequently, the public
works department is authorized to impose reasonable conditions in order to mitigate those
potential adverse impacts that may result, whether on an individual or a cumulative basis, from
permitted aboveground facilities. Those conditions may include or relate to, without limitation, the
following:
1. Prior to issuance of the requisite permits, all aboveground facilities proposed to be installed by a
utility or other service provider in the public rights of way must be clearly delineated on the plans
when they are submitted for the city's review.
2. The design and installation by qualified professionals of landscaping and barriers to minimize
public view of aboveground facilities whose location has been approved by the city.
3. The maintenance of all aboveground facilities in good condition, including compliance with the
city's ordinances regarding graffiti removal. In this regard, a utility or other service provider may
be required to affix to its aboveground facilities a coded label or marker that identifies the
specific facility and sets forth a telephone number that may be called to report any damage,
destruction, or graffiti vandalism involving that facility.
4. The placement of aboveground facilities, such as overhead drops, as close as possible to other
utility drops, consistent with all applicable electrical codes.
5. Reasonable limitations upon the number of aboveground facilities that may be installed within a
designated geographical area.
6. Reasonable limitations upon the dimensions or volume, or both, of aboveground facilities.
7. The specification of colors of aboveground facilities reasonably requested by the city to ensure
that these facilities blend with the surrounding environment to the maximum extent possible.
8. Such additional conditions regulating the time, place, and manner of installations of
aboveground facilities as will reasonably mitigate potential safety hazards and adverse visual
impacts attributable to these facilities.
C. The city reserves all rights that it now possesses or may later acquire to adopt and implement
citywide requirements for the undergrounding of aboveground facilities, or any portion thereof, in a
competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner. To the extent authorized by law, all utility and
other service providers will be required to comply with those requirements at their sole expense.
