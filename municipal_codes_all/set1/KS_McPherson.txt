PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of McPherson, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1995 Code, as supplemented through October 31, 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1995 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Gary L. Meagher, City Clerk/Administrator, and Mr. Philip C. Lacey, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-115. - Vacation leave bank. 
    As an amendment to the city employee handbook and as a supplement to existing leave policy, the following is hereby added to the employee handbook as a separate insert. 
(1)  Employee eligibility. 
a.  Overall participation. 
1.  Full time employees who have completed 12 months of service with the city are eligible to participate in the vacation leave bank. Specific participation guidelines for donors and requestors follow this section. Employees in classifications which do not accrue vacation are not eligible to participate in this program. 
(2)  Donor specific information. 
a.  Donors must meet the guidelines stated in the overall participation section of this policy. Employees on an approved leave of absence may not donate. 
(3)  Requestor specific information. 
a.  Requestors must meet the guidelines stated in the overall participation section of this policy. 
b.  Requestors must be on an approved leave of absence for their own illness or the illness of an FMLA eligible family member. Medical certification of the leave is required. 
c.  You must donate to the bank to request time from the vacation leave bank. 
(4)  Donation guidelines. 
a.  Donors can only donate accrued vacation leave hours. In any calendar year, an eligible employee must donate a minimum of eight hours and up to a maximum of 40 hours for regular full time employees or a minimum of 24 hours or up to a maximum of 112 hours for fire fighters. All donations must be in full hour increments. Unaccrued leave is not eligible for donation. If a donor is at the maximum accrual for vacation, only vacation leave currently accrued is eligible for donation. Donors cannot borrow future vacation leave accruals for donation. 
b.  Once hours are donated, the donor has given up all rights to the hours. The hours remain in the vacation leave bank until used by an eligible employee. Donations are voluntary, and irrevocable. If a donor leaves city employment, there is no right to receive compensation for hours donated to the leave bank. 
c.  Employees are encouraged to carefully consider the number of hours that they elect to donate to ensure they retain a leave balance which meets their personal needs. Typically employees are encouraged to retain at least 50 percent of their available vacation leave balance. 
d.  Donations are made to the vacation leave bank, not to specific employees. It is the responsibility of the human resource department to determine payout based on the program guidelines. 
(5)  Requestor guidelines. 
a.  Requestors must complete all required documentation and meet the eligibility requirements in order to be considered for leave hours from the vacation leave bank. 
b.  Requestors are eligible to apply for consideration for vacation leave bank hours when the following criteria have been met: 
1.  The requestor is on an approved leave of absence. 
2.  The requestor has exhausted all available leave time: sick leave, vacation time, OTAH, and accrued comp time. 
c.  The request meets the catastrophic definition and is covered by one of the following: 
1.  A serious health condition as defined by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). 
2.  A serious health condition of a covered member of the employees' family which meets the qualifications of a serious health condition as defined by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). 
d.  The maximum number of hours available for payout is dependent upon the number of hours in the vacation leave bank and may not exceed 80 hours per calendar year or 144 hours for fire fighters per calendar year. Requestors may request one additional allocation per calendar year. Consideration will be given based on needs, hours available, and will require the approval of the human resources department. 
e.  Payments end based on: the employee returning to work; the employee's separation from the city or a medical release from the employee family member's doctor. 
f.  For an employee's own illness, the employee must use all accrued sick leave, accrued vacation leave, OTAH time, and accrued comp time. Then the employee will use approved vacation leave bank hours up to 80 hours or 144 hours for fire fighters, and then will receive 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave. (The employee must qualify for FMLA leave which requires 12 months employment with the city.) 
g.  For an employee's family member, the employee must use all unused vacation time, OTAH time, and accrued comp time. Then the employee will be eligible to use approved vacation leave bank hours up to 80 hours or 144 hours for fire fighters, and then will receive 12 weeks unpaid FMLA leave. 
(6)  Tax treatments. 
a.  Donors. Donated time does not qualify as a charitable contribution for the donor's tax purposes. 
b.  Requestors. Requestors will be taxed on the value of the vacation leave bank time paid to them at their most recent rate of pay. The value of such payments is subject to all applicable tax deductions and withholding orders. 
(7)  Procedures. 
a.  Donations are based on hours, not pay rate. 
b.  Leave hours are paid at the requestor's most recent rate of pay. 
c.  Payment of the vacation leave bank hours is coordinated through the city clerk's office. Payment is coordinated in the same manner as the regular payroll process. 
d.  If there are not enough hours in the vacation leave bank, the request will be placed in pending status for 30 days. If there are no hours available at the end of the 30-day period, the request will be closed. The employee may reapply for further consideration. 
e.  If there are multiple requests in pending status and leave hours become available, payment will be based on the order of approval and the available leave hours. 
f.  Membership in the vacation leave bank will be a one-year term January 1 to December 31. The city may have a second donation period during the calendar year if the bank has a zero balance before December 31. 
g.  Should the requestor return to work prior to the leave payout being utilized, the remaining leave payout will be credited back to the vacation leave bank. 
h.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, there is no right to vacation leave bank hours and if the request is denied or there are no available hours in the leave bank, there is no means of appeal. 
(8)  Definitions. 
a.  Catastrophic. Catastrophic generally means the employee or employee's family member cannot work for an extended period of time and that the leave of absence from work creates a significant financial hardship. Further, the qualifying event meets one or more of the following: poses a threat to life; is a progressive debilitating illness from which recovery is prolonged or unlikely and which involves total medical incapacity for an extended period of time (generally in excess of 90 days); and/or requires extended inpatient or hospice health care. 
b.  Serious health condition. The health condition must meet qualifications of a serious health condition as defined by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and certified by a medical physician. 
c.  Vacation leave bank. All donated leave hours are maintained in a vacation leave bank pending approved payouts. This vacation leave bank is managed by the human resources department. 
(9)  Other provisions. 
a.  Decisions made under the vacation leave bank are not subject to the city grievance process. 
b.  Vacation leave bank payments do not extend or otherwise affect the amount of leave of absence time an employee may be granted. 
c.  The vacation leave bank program recognizes some situations which may be covered by this program are often of a very personal nature. As such, while participation is encouraged, active solicitation by employees either for donations or by requestors for specific situations, is not normally encouraged and should be discussed with human resources in advance. 
d.  If doctor approved, light duty may be given as an option for the employee to return to work as soon as possible (police department does not have a light duty policy). 
e.  The City of McPherson retains the right to modify, or change the program at any time.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 10-1. - Dangerous animals. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Dangerous animal includes any animal: 
(1)  With a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack unprovoked, cause injury or otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or domestic animals; 
(2)  Which attacks a human being or domestic animal without provocation; 
(3)  Owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of fighting; 
(4)  Trained for fighting; 
(5)  Which is urged by its owner or harborer to attack, or whose owner or harborer threatens to provoke such animal to attack, any law enforcement officer while such officer is engaged in the performance of official duty. 
(b)  Conditions of confinement. Any animal which could be determined to be a dangerous animal under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be kept or confined only under conditions and circumstances which minimize the danger to public health and safety. 
(c)  Possession restricted. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep, possess or harbor a dangerous animal within the city, except as provided in this section. Impoundment of animals causing a citation for violation of this section shall be at the discretion of the chief of police. If the animal presents a clear and present danger to the public health or safety, it shall be the duty of the animal control officer, any police officer of the city or any person appointed to act on behalf of such persons to impound such animal. If the animal cannot be impounded without unreasonably exposing the person attempting to impound such animal to an attack or bite, then the chief of police may order the animal immediately destroyed. 
(d)  Complaints. Whenever a sworn complaint is filed in the municipal court of the city alleging that an animal is dangerous and that it is being kept or harbored in violation of this section, the municipal judge shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not the animal is dangerous within the meaning of this section, and is being kept or harbored in violation of this section. The owner or harborer of the animal shall be notified in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least one week prior to the hearing. In making a determination, the municipal judge shall consider the following: 
(1)  Seriousness of any attack or bite; 
(2)  Past history of attacks or bites; 
(3)  Likelihood of future attacks or bites; 
(4)  Conditions and circumstances under which the animal is kept or confined; 
(5)  Any other factors which may reasonably relate to the determination of whether or not the animal is dangerous. 
(e)  Impounding, muzzling, confinement or destruction prior to hearing. Pending the hearing, if the subject animal has not already been impounded, the municipal judge may order the impoundment, muzzling and/or confinement of the subject animal in a manner and location that will minimize danger to other persons or animals pending the outcome of the hearing. If such impoundment, muzzling or other safe confinement is not reasonably feasible, or if prior municipal court orders to restrain such animal have gone unheeded, the judge may order the animal immediately destroyed without a hearing. 
(f)  Determination. If after the hearing, the municipal judge determines that the subject animal is dangerous within the meaning of this section, and is being kept or harbored in violation of this section, then the municipal judge shall find the owner, keeper or harborer guilty of a violation of this section, and shall order the owner or harborer to immediately destroy such animal or permanently remove the animal from the city (other than by abandonment), and to furnish proof of such destruction or removal within a period of time set by the municipal judge; provided, however, if the animal has been determined to be dangerous under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the municipal judge may establish conditions under which the animal may be kept or harbored and order the return of such animal. Before the animal is returned to its owner or harborer, the municipal judge shall require the animal to be properly licensed by the city, if not already licensed, and shall require the person taking custody of the animal to pay all accrued impoundment charges and post a cash bond in the amount as set by resolution of the governing body to ensure compliance with the court's orders. If such orders are not complied with and proof of such compliance filed with the municipal court, the animal control officer or a police officer, or any combination thereof, shall impound such animal and have the animal destroyed, or if such animal cannot be impounded without danger to such officers, such officers shall destroy the animal immediately. Upon such impoundment or destruction of the animal, the municipal judge shall order the cash bond forfeited.

(c)  The chief of police and police officers shall take up and impound any animal found running at large in violation of this section. Any animal impounded pursuant to this section may be redeemed by paying the impoundment fee and boarding fee. If any person owning or claiming any impounded animal neglects or refuses to redeem any such animal after three days, the poundmaster is hereby authorized to release the animal for the redemption fee or have the animal destroyed.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 18-752. - Purposes. 
    The purposes of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect the public water supply of the city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating potential contamination or pollution within a customer's internal distribution system or private water system; 
(2)  Promote the elimination or control of existing cross connections, actual or potential, between a customer's in-plant potable water system and nonpotable water system, plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and 
(3)  Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
(Code 1995, § 4-5B01) 
Sec. 18-753. - Responsibility for system protection. 
    The BPU shall be responsible for the protection of the system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through water service connections. If, in the judgment of the BPU, an approved backflow preventer is required at the customer's water service connection or within the customer's private water system for the safety of the system, the BPU shall give notice in writing to the customer to install an approved backflow preventer at specific locations on the customer's premises. The customer shall install such backflow preventer at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain the backflow preventer shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service from the system to the customer's premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Code 1995, § 4-5B02) 
Sec. 18-754. - Connection requirements. 
    The following are required for water service connections to the system: 
(1)  No water service connection to any customer's premises shall be installed or maintained by the BPU unless the water supply is protected as required by this article. Service of water shall be discontinued if a backflow preventer required by this article is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow preventer has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(2)  The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the BPU to determine whether cross connections, or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this article, exist. After the inspection of the customer's system, the BPU shall notify the customer in writing of the backflow preventer that must be installed, if any. The customer shall have 90 days after the date of the notification to install the required assembly. Service to the customer will be discontinued if the required assembly is not installed within the 90-day period. 
(3)  It shall be the duty of the customer at any premises where a backflow preventer is installed to have operational tests made upon each installed backflow preventer at least once per year. In the instances where the BPU deems the hazard to be greater, operational tests may be required at more frequent intervals. If the installed backflow preventer fails its operational test, it shall be repaired. If the unit cannot pass the test it shall be replaced. A repaired, replaced or new device shall pass an operational test before being placed in service. The inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the customer and shall be performed by a certified tester. BPU may notify the customer when the annual inspection is to be performed, but the lack of notice shall not be a defense. The certified tester must use and BPU will provide backflow prevention assembly test report forms which shall be signed by the certified tester and returned to the BPU. If the legible and complete test report form is not received by BPU within 14 days of its due date, BPU may charge the customer an administration fee equal to $25.00 per device for each day beginning on the 15th day after the test report is due and ending on the date of receipt or termination of service. Failure to perform the annual test or supply the BPU with the completed test report form by the test due date will constitute cause for termination of service. The BPU shall set from time to time a fee for termination and reconnection of service under this section and any other policies, procedures and standards reasonably necessary to efficiently or effectively implement the testing required herein. 
(4)  All portable equipment used for fertilizer and pesticide application shall be free of any cross connection or be separated from the system by a backflow preventer as determined by the BPU. 
(Code 1995, § 4-5B04; Ord. No. 2535, § 1, 11-12-1996; Ord. No. 3049, § 1, 3-12-2012)

    Any over size load shall also comply with all federal and state rules and regulations. Any over size load traveling upon or across Kansas Ave (US Hwy 56) or South Main St (US Business Hwy 81) shall also obtain a Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) Oversize/Overweight Permit.

Such application shall specify the day and hour the move is to commence and the route through the city's streets over which the over size load shall be moved and other details of the over size load as required. The application shall be accompanied by a permit fee as set by resolution of the governing body, which shall be deposited to the credit of the general fund.

Registration of the power unit must be the larger of the combined vehicle weight and load, or the maximum amount of registration available. 
(1)  If the load is for a house, mobile home, or building, the permit shall be designated over size load (house); 
(2)  If the over size load is anything other than a house, mobile home, or building, the permit shall be designated over size load (other). 
(d)  In addition to the cost of the permit fee, the applicant shall prepay an impact fee equal to the costs of extra city services attributable to the over size load, including but not limited to: police escort and traffic control; labor, materials, equipment, and vehicle costs for placing and removal of barricades; adjustment and removal of lighting, signage, traffic signals, and related supporting structures; and, any required engineering work as determined by the public works director or designee.

The fees shall be calculated based upon the then current charges and based upon the level of service determined necessary by relevant city staff. If the actual impact fee is less than the estimate, the difference shall be refunded to the applicant within ten business days. If the estimated fees are less than the actual impact fee, the applicant shall pay to the city within ten business days the difference. No permit may be issued unless and until the estimated impact fee has been received by the city. The impact fee is not in lieu of payment for property damage caused by the over size load or a defense to any claim for such damage.

The governing body shall hold the hearing within 30 days after the filing of the request, and the city shall give the prospective occupant reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing. Following the public hearing, if the city governing body denies a potential occupant's request to use or occupy a specific portion of the public right-of-way, such determination may be appealed to district court.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 3105, § 1, adopted June 24, 2013, repealed the former Art. VI, §§ 70-201-70-207, and enacted a new Art. VI as set out herein. The former Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2943, adopted Dec. 17, 2007 and Ord. No. 2959 adopted May 19, 2008. 

Sec. 70-201. - Application. 
    Any person or legal entity desiring to construct any street improvements within the boundaries of the city shall preliminarily apply to the city's department of public works for approval pursuant to the then existing policy and procedures for such improvements. The final application, to consist of construction plans and specifications, a construction cost estimate and a soils testing report, all prepared and stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Kansas, shall be submitted to the city's department of public works for approval. Simultaneously with the filing of the final application, a petition for the improvements prepared in accordance with K.S.A. 12-6a01 et seq. shall be filed with the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 3105, § 1, 6-24-2013) 
Sec. 70-202. - Types of streets affected. 
    The provisions of this article shall govern all of the city's streets, which are defined as follows: 
    Local residential streets. The primary function of which is to provide access to abutting property and movement of local traffic. 
    Collector streets. Streets which provide land access service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas. These streets differ from arterial streets in that collector streets may penetrate residential neighborhoods, distributing trips from arterial streets through the area to their ultimate destination. Collector streets also collect traffic from local streets and residential neighborhoods and channel it into the arterial system. 
    Minor arterial streets. Streets which interconnect with the principal arterial street system. They accommodate trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of travel mobility than that of principal arterial streets. 
    Principal arterial streets. Streets on which the nature and composition of travel is unusually significant. They primarily provide through travel service to rural-oriented traffic, but also provide service for major circulation movements within the city's immediate urban area.

The fee shall be charged for all property wholly or partially outside of an established sewer district, for the privilege of connecting the unit to the sewer system. The fee shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio that the area of the property which is within an established sewer district bears to the entire area of the property, and if such property shall, within three years immediately following the making of such connection, be taken into a sewer district and be assessed for the construction of sanitary sewers, laterals and mains, the connection fee shall be returned to the owner of the property at the time the assessment for such sewer district is made. 
(b)  Such sewer connections as provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be permitted only upon receiving a permit from the director of public works and upon payment in full of the connection fee. 
(Code 1995, §§ 15-102, 15-103; Ord. No. 2551, § 1(15-102), 3-31-1997) 
Sec. 86-96. - Sewer connections outside city limits. 
(a)  The owner of any property situated outside of, but adjacent to, the city, upon proving himself to the satisfaction of the city attorney to be the owner of such property, and upon compliance with the provisions, restrictions and limitations of this article and all other ordinances of the city pertaining to building construction, plumbing and electrical installation, and public health, safety and sanitation, may make application, as a concession, but not as a matter of right, for a license to connect such property to the city's sewer system and to discharge usual and ordinary wastewater into the city's sewer system. If such property shall, within three years immediately following the making of such connection, be taken into a city sewer district and be assessed for the construction of sanitary sewers, laterals and mains, the connection fee shall be returned to the owner of the property at the time the assessment for such sewer district is made. 
(b)  Any such owner desiring to make such a sewer connection shall apply in writing to the city clerk for a permit to do so. The application shall be signed by all of the owners of the premises and will constitute a contract by such owners to comply with applicable city ordinances and to submit to any penalties for a violation thereof. Such application shall state the: 
(1)  Legal description of the premises; 
(2)  Names and addresses of the legal, equitable and beneficial owners of the premises and the source of their title; 
(3)  Number and kind of sewer intake openings to be connected; 
(4)  Exact point of the proposed connection; and 
(5)  Applicants will comply with this article and all other present and future ordinances of the city the same as though such premises were within the city. 
(c)  The city clerk, upon receiving such application, shall present it to the governing body at its next regular meeting. Such governing body, if it finds that all requirements of this article have been complied with and that the sewer to which the applicant desires to connect is not, and will not become, overloaded and that wastewater from such premises can be disposed of without expense to the city in excess of the amount of the license fee as set forth in subsection (d) of this section, may direct the city clerk to issue the license applied for. The licensee shall pay all costs of lines, pipes, connections, fixtures and other charges for making the sewer connection. 
(d)  There is hereby established and imposed a fee as set by resolution of the governing body for the connection of any property outside the corporate limits of the city to the city sewer system. The sewer connection fee shall be paid in full at the time a license is granted. 
(e)  This section shall apply equally to all persons and property connected to the city sewer system beyond the city limits. The property shall be subject to the same inspections as are provided for within the city. 
(Code 1995, §§ 15-104-15-108; Ord. No. 2551, § 1(15-105, 15-107), 3-31-1997) 
Sec. 86-97. - Sewer connection surcharge. 
(a)  There is hereby imposed on each new sanitary sewer connection made after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, to provide sanitary sewer service to any lot or tract of land, or part thereof, which has not previously been assessed, a sewer connection surcharge (i.e., a charge in addition to other charges imposed by this article for connection to, or use of, the city's sanitary sewer system) in such amounts and determined in such methods as are set forth in this section. 
(b)  Except as noted, each residential unit making a separate connection to the city's sanitary sewer system shall be assessed a sewer connection surcharge (referred to in this section as the "connection surcharge"). Notwithstanding the above, for any multi-family residential structures that have common legal ownership of such residential units, the connection surcharge shall be assessed the connection surcharge per tap plus a unit fee multiplied by the number of units. The connection surcharge and the unit fee shall be set from time to time by resolution of the governing body. For purposes of determining the connection surcharge, the term "multi-family residential unit" means a duplex, triplex, fourplex, apartment, apartment buildings or mobile home dwelling units, but does not include a condominium or detached single family residence. The connection surcharge and unit fee, if any, shall be due and payable at the time the residential unit is connected to the city's sanitary sewer system. The connection surcharge shall be in addition to any other fees or charges payable upon connection to the city's sanitary sewer system. 
(c)  Each nonresidential unit making a separate connection to the city's sanitary sewer system shall be assessed a nonresidential connection surcharge. For purposes of this section, the term "nonresidential use" includes manufacturing, industrial, commercial, school or nonprofit organization users, other than a residential use owned or operated by a commercial business or nonprofit organization. For each nonresidential use, the initial nonresidential connection surcharge shall be 75 percent of the base connection surcharge for a residential unit. A second nonresidential connection surcharge shall be made 18 months after assessment of the initial connection surcharge. The second nonresidential connection surcharge shall be an amount equal to $550.00 for each 6,700 gallons of water actually used on the premises on an average monthly basis during the 18-month prove-up period. Water use on the premises shall be determined by the records of the water department of the city's board of public utilities. Credit shall be given against the second surcharge for the amount previously paid as an initial connection surcharge. Any nonresidential user may install a sewer meter on the premises to measure the amount of water discharged into the city's sanitary sewer system. If such a meter is installed and measures a discharge of water over at least 12 of the 18 months of the prove-up period, then the second connection surcharge shall be based on actual average monthly gallons of wastewater actually discharged into the city's sanitary sewer system during the prove-up period. 
(d)  With respect to any nonresidential user, the governing body may, from time to time, by resolution, modify the connection surcharge set forth in an ordinance for any particular nonresidential user, taking into account such matters as the quantity or quality of industrial waste discharged into the city's sanitary sewer system, water consumed in a user's industrial or manufacturing process or evaporated for cooling purposes and any other factor which may reasonably be determined to affect the quantity or quality of water discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Upon the enactment of such a resolution the connection surcharge for such industrial users shall be assessed as set forth in this section. 
(e)  For each separate new sewer connection to the city's sanitary sewer system for a user located outside the corporate limits of the city where the lot or tract of land, or part thereof, has not previously been assessed a connection surcharge, the connection surcharge shall be 150 percent of the connection surcharge determined as otherwise set forth in this section. 
(f)  If the use of an installation previously connected to the city's sanitary sewer system changes so as to increase the rate of discharge of water into the city's sanitary sewer system, the city may reclassify the user and assess an additional connection surcharge based upon the new classification. An 18-month prove-up period shall be allowed after the reclassification, during which period, water use data shall be assembled as in the case of a new nonresidential user. At the end of the prove-up period, the additional connection surcharge, if any, shall be due and payable. Credit shall be given against the amount calculated for the connection surcharge previously paid. If a use is changed so that a smaller amount of water is discharged into the city's sanitary sewer system than under the previous use, no refund of the previously paid connection surcharge shall be made. A change in the volume or characteristics of wastewater discharged by any user may be determined to be a change in use. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the ability of the city to enter into special contractual arrangements with new users for the payment of such connection surcharges, or waive connection surcharges, as the governing body may deem to be in the best interests of the city's sewer utility or the community at large. 
(h)  The final cost for connection surcharge shall be calculated and verified by the city's director of public works or by his/her designee after a request is made for a new sewer connection. The director of public works may require a written application for sewer service, identifying the name of the owner and legal description of the lot or tract of land to which sewer service is to be extended, a description of the intended use of the property after the sewer connection is made, the estimated volume of wastewater discharge to be made pursuant to such use, any unusual characteristics of such wastewater and any other information deemed necessary in order to make a determination of the amount of the connection surcharge. At such time as the director of public works has made a determination of the amount of the connection surcharge, the owner of the property to be served will be rendered a bill for the amount of the connection surcharge, or the initial payment, if the proposed use is a nonresidential use. If any owner or lessee of a lot or tract of land believes that the use of the property has been improperly characterized by the director of public works, such owner or lessee may appeal such determination to the governing body. The governing body's action on any such appeal shall be final. If a determination of the amount of the surcharge has not been made at the time of connection to the sanitary sewer system, the owner shall pay the minimum connection surcharge for a residential or nonresidential use, as the case may be, and shall pay the balance upon receipt of a bill for such amount. Billings will be made only to the record owners of the properties to be served, and if a connection is made before the entire connection surcharge is made, then the city shall have a lien on the property served for the amount of the unpaid surcharge. The city may perfect its lien by filing a notice of lien with the county register of deeds, which notice must contain a legal description of the property subject to the lien, the names of the record owners of the property, the amount of the unpaid connection surcharge, the date on which the billing for the connection surcharge was made and a reference to this section or the corresponding section of this Code. If it becomes necessary for the city to foreclose its lien, the lien must be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mechanic's and materialman's liens, other than the statute of limitations for the filing of such actions, which shall not apply to actions to foreclose the city's lien. 
(i)  Payment of the connection surcharges imposed by this section shall ordinarily be due not later than the time of issuance of a building permit by the city. The city inspector may withhold issuance of a building permit until all connection fees due have been paid. In the case of a nonresidential user, payment due at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be the initial connection surcharge. 
(j)  All connection surcharge payments received by the city shall be deposited in the city's sewer utility system surplus fund, as such fund exists or may be modified in the discretion of the governing body. Application of such moneys shall be for the benefit of the city's sanitary sewer system as determined in the discretion of the governing body. 
(k)  If a billing for a connection surcharge remains unpaid for more than 30 days past the mailing of the statement to the owner of the property at such owner's last known address, then the amount owing shall be considered delinquent, and there shall be added to the amount owing a penalty in the amount of ten percent of the amount past due, but not to exceed $500.00. In addition, interest at the maximum statutory rate shall begin to accrue on the unpaid amounts from the 30th day after mailing of the statement. In addition, the city may, upon ten days' written notice to the owner of the property, discontinue water service or sewer service, or both, to the owner or occupant of the subject property. If the property is being used for a residential use, then the notice of termination shall state the date, time and place of a hearing to be held upon the termination, at which time, the owner or occupant shall be permitted to show good cause why water service or sewer service, or both, should not be disconnected. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a waiver or estoppel affecting the city's rights to bring a civil action for the collection of unpaid service charges, connection surcharges, penalties or interest, or for foreclosure of its lien. 
(l)  With respect to any property newly annexed into the corporate limits of the city, which property is connected to the city's sanitary sewer system, the owner of such property shall be assessed connection surcharges in accordance with this section if the property has not previously been assessed a connection surcharge and paid such surcharge. 
(m)  Any person or tenant occupying land or representing the owner or occupant of land upon, or to, which a sanitary sewer connection has been knowingly made in violation of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(n)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a new tap installed to replace an existing tap that presently has sewer service will be $200.00 for a new tap. This fee may be changed from time to time by resolution of the governing body.

Sec. 86-163. - Transitioning multiple properties on a common sewer service line to separate service lines. 
    The governing body hereby declares that the common use of one sewer service line by multiple residential properties ("common sewers") or properties that do not have direct access or formal easements to a city sewer main ("informal sewers") are injurious to the health and safety of the citizens of the city due to increased likelihood of failure, multiple properties subject to sewer back- up by any one failure and the difficulty of repair and maintenance of such service lines. The city acknowledges that there are multiple residential properties in the city with common sewers or informal sewers and that as the opportunity arises, such residences should be switched in an orderly way to separate service lines with direct formal access so that each property meets the requirements for new residential construction. 
(a)  Common sewers. After an affected property owner reports two or more sewer problems with a common sewer to the city public works department or at the discretion of the director of public works, the city will notify the owners of each property with service connected to the common sewer of the issue. Thereafter, the city shall extend the main sewer line, if necessary, and take sure further steps so that property owners on common sewers have direct access to attach service lines to the city main sewer line. The city shall pay the cost of the installation of the main sewer line and notify all involved property owners. At the time the main sewer line is installed, all property owners must connect directly to the city sewer main at their expense and the use of the common sewer must cease. Failure to connect shall be declared a public nuisance pursuant to Code section 50-31 and failure to abate such nuisance shall carry the penalties provided by Code section 50-37. 
(b)  Informal sewers. After an affected property owner reports two or more sewer problems with an informal sewer, the city public works department may send written notice to all affect property owners indicating the presence of the informal sewer. The city may maintain a listing of informal sewers and provide access to property owners, realtors, lenders, potential buyers and other interested parties, but will not warrant the completeness or accuracy of such index. Property owners may have their residence removed from such index by demonstrating to the satisfaction of the public works department that direct access or acceptable easements have been obtained for any service line. The city reserves the right to declare a particular informal service as a public nuisance and take such further acts as authorized by law. 
(c)  Discretion of work on common and informal sewers. The timing and priority of such improvement work shall be at the discretion of the city, trying to balance the risk of harm, the number of residences affected and the availability of city resources. The city retains the sole discretion to determine which properties with common sewers will be addressed in any given year.

(a)  Any person, firm or corporation having a premises connected to the City sewer system and found by analytical testing to be discharging a waste concentration in excess of 300 mg/l 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and/or 350 mg/l Total Suspended Solids (TSS) shall be required to pay a high-strength waste surcharge. 
(b)  All sewer users wishing to discharge waste in excess of 300 mg/l five-day BOD and/or 350 mg/l TSS shall make application for a permit on such form or forms as may be provided by the wastewater superintendent. The wastewater superintendent will review said application and determine whether the wastewater treatment facility can effectively handle the proposed high-strength waste load, considering without limitation such things as strength of the waste, volume of the waste, current wastewater treatment plant biological and hydraulic capacity, impact on the wastewater treatment plant's ability to provide for other existing and potential uses, and similar considerations. If approved by the wastewater superintendent, the city commission may issue a high-strength waste discharge permit. If disapproved by the wastewater superintendent, the applicant may appeal such disapproval to the city commission. 
(c)  If the city commission approves a high-strength waste discharge permit, the applicant may then discharge high-strength waste into the public sewer within the limits set forth in the permit, subject to payment of a monthly surcharge to defray the city's expenses for additional treatment, calculated initially at $0.42 per pound of BOD and $0.34 per pound of TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer. The surcharge amount per pound of BOD and/or TSS shall be re-computed in March of each year, based on a three-year running average of treatment expenses per pound of BOD and TSS at the wastewater treatment plant. 
(d)  The amount of any sewer user's surcharge shall be determined upon initial approval and thereafter semiannually. The strength of waste discharged by any permitted sewer user shall be determined by random sampling. The sampling shall be conducted by wastewater treatment plant staff. Applicant shall fully comply with city staff in obtaining the samples. The city shall conduct the tests for BOD and TSS either in the wastewater treatment plant laboratory or by utilizing a commercial contract laboratory. Applicant shall reimburse the city for actual costs of labor, materials, and/or contract services incurred in obtaining samples, running tests, analyzing test results, and preparing reports. These charges shall be in addition to the sewer service rates charged under sections 86-215 and 86-217 of the Code, as amended from time to time and the high-strength surcharge imposed under this section. If a sewer user makes a significant change to reduce the strength of its wastewater discharge, a written request may be submitted to have the wastewater retested temporary changes in waste load reduction will not be considered. 
(e)  If the wastewater superintendent determines that the holder of a high-strength waste discharge permit is discharging waste in excess of the permitted amount, or if the treatment capacity of the wastewater treatment plant is no longer able to treat the waste being discharged in the quantities or strength allowed in the permit, the wastewater superintendent may revoke the permit. Any sewer user aggrieved by the revocation of the permit may appeal the wastewater superintendent's decision to the city commission, the decision of which shall be final.

Sec. 86-214. - Basis for rates. 
    The monthly sewer use rates required to be charged and collected through officers and agents of the sewer system of the city for the use of, and services rendered by, the sewer system of the city, shall be as follows: 
(1)  For each service unit using the city's water and sewer system and having a sewer connection, directly or indirectly, with the sewer system of the city, a monthly charge on the average water use during the initial base period, or such subsequent base period according to a schedule as adopted from time to time by the governing body and filed with the city clerk. 
(2)  If, on any property, except a single-family dwelling, connected with the sewer system of the city, water is obtained from a source in addition to the city's water system, then the user shall, at his own expense, install and maintain on the premises a water meter or sewer meter satisfactory to the director of public works, which meter shall measure all water received on the premises from all sources or such water obtained from sources other than the city's water system may be measured and determined by other records kept and maintained by such user and open to inspection by, and acceptable to, the city's representative. In such cases, the sewer use charges shall be made on the aggregate quantity of water received on the premises from the city's water system and all other sources. 
(3)  For trailer parks, mobile home parks, manufactured home courts or camps, apartment buildings and apartment houses accommodating three or more families, each having separate kitchen facilities, which are served by a single water meter, using the city's water and sewer system and having a direct or indirect sewer connection, a monthly sewer use charge shall be charged to the person to whom water service is furnished by the board of public utilities of the city, based on the schedule of rates and charges adopted from time to time by the governing body. For the purposes of establishing base sewer rates, individual living units having a separate kitchen facility shall be charged a separate base rate. 
(4)  For recreational vehicle ("RV") parks, a monthly sewer charge shall be charged to the owner or operator of the recreational vehicle park to whom water service is furnished by the board of public utilities of the city, based on the schedule of rates and charges adopted from time to time by the governing body. For purposes of establishing base sewer rates, individual RV pad sites shall be considered separate units. In addition to the base rate, the RV park owner or operator shall also be charged a user fee in equal monthly installments based upon the previous years total water usage for the RV park divided by 12 and multiplied by the rates as set by the governing body from time to time. In the first year of operation, the city will produce a good faith estimate of usage and bill from such estimate and then adjust the rate in the first year in which actual information is available. RV parks whose premises connected to the city sewer system are outside the corporate limits of the city shall be 150 percent of the foregoing rates and charges charged. For purposes of this section, a recreational vehicle shall be defined in the same manner as a recreational vehicle is defined in the zoning regulations of the City of McPherson, Kansas.

c.  When the interceptor is not retaining or capturing oils and greases. 
(4)  Pumping variance. Any facility which holds a current GCP may apply for a variance from the pumping frequency requirement. If the Director determines the proposed variance maintains compliance with subsections (e)(3)a., b., and c. above, the director may grant a variance or modified schedule. Any variance or modified pumping schedule shall thereafter become a requirement under this Code, applicable to that permit holder, and shall be subject to further revision or revocation as necessary for the public health and the proper maintenance of the POTW. 
(5)  Disposal. Wastes removed from each interceptor shall be disposed of in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Grease, solid materials, and gray water removed from interceptors shall not be returned to the POTW except for food service facilities that use a two compartment pump truck where the compartments are fully separate with their own valve system so there is no cross contamination between the gray water and the grease/solids material. Subsequently, gray water may be re-introduced to the POTW provided the wastewater grease concentration does not exceed 100 mg/L. 
(f)  Alternative grease removal devices or technologies. Alternative devices and technologies such as automatic grease removal systems shall be subject to written permission by the director prior to installation. Permission to use the device shall be based on demonstrated and proven removal efficiencies and reliability of operation. The city may permit these types of devices on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 86-266. - Accidental discharges. 
    Each user subject to the requirements of this article shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans, showing facilities and operating procedures to provide such protection, shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facilities. All existing users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1984. No users that commence contribution to the wastewater collection system after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the facilities, as necessary, to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the wastewater treatment plant of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(1)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the authorized representative of the user shall submit to the director of public works a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater collection system, fish kills or other damage to persons or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the users' bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

The BMP's could appear in the drainage criteria manual, stormwater management plan, or other commission-approved document. 
    The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of structural or non-structural BMP's. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural or non-structural BMP's to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMP's shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
    Where BMP requirements are promulgated by the city or any federal, state, or regional agency for any activity, operation, or facility which would otherwise cause the discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system or waters of the United States, every person undertaking such activity or operation, or owning or operating such facility, shall comply with such requirements. 
(b)  Duty to report. The public works director, or delegated appointee, shall report to the city commission annually on the status of implementation of BMP's in the stormwater management plan. Such report will contain the pollutants of concern to be addressed the next year, and any new BMP's to be developed. 
(c)  New development and redevelopment. The city may adopt requirements identifying BMP's to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation, transport, and discharge of pollutants. The city shall incorporate such requirements in any land use entitlement and construction or building-related permit to be issued relative to such development or redevelopment. The owner and developer shall comply with the terms, provisions, and conditions of such land use entitlements and building permits as required in this article. 
(Ord. No. 2912, § 1, 2-12-2007) 
Sec. 86-320. - Requirement to eliminate illegal discharges. 
    The public works director or designated appointee may require by written notice that a person responsible for an illegal discharge immediately, or by a specified date, discontinue the discharge and, if necessary, take measures to eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of future illegal discharges. 
(Ord. No. 2912, § 1, 2-12-2007)

ARTICLE VI. - STORM WATER UTILITY 

Sec. 86-350. - Creation of storm water utility. 
    The City of McPherson does hereby establish a storm water utility, the purpose of which is to assist the city in its responsibility for the operation, construction, maintenance and repair of storm water drainage system facilities to provide adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of storm water and the reduction of potential hazards to property and life resulting from storm water runoff, improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable storm water conditions and improvements to the water quality in the storm and surface water system and its receiving waters. The storm water utility shall have all the powers granted to it under the city's Charter Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 9-6-2016) 
Sec. 86-351. - Program responsibility. 
    The City shall be empowered to administer the storm water utility and may delegate such duty and responsibility as is necessary to carry out the provisions of this article within the limits of the relevant Charter Ordinance, budget, directives and storm drainage regulations adopted by the governing body of the city for this utility. 
(Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 9-6-2016) 
Sec. 86-352. - Operating budget. 
    The city shall adopt an operating budget for each fiscal year. The operating budget shall set forth, for each fiscal year, the estimated revenues and the estimated costs for the storm water utility. The initial operating budget shall be for the fiscal year commencing January 1, 2017. 
(Ord. No. 3223, § 1, 9-6-2016) 
Sec. 86-353. - Fee schedule established. 
(a)  There is hereby assessed against all property within the City that is connected to either water or sanitary sewer or electric systems ("applicable city services") of the city or its board of public utilities, a monthly storm water utility fee. Such fee is based upon a determination of a comparable amount of impervious area for uses within each rate category, as set forth hereinafter. The owner, occupant and any person who is responsible for the payment of applicable city services, shall all be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of said fee. The fee shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  All property devoted to a residential use shall be assessed the sum of $7.00 per month per living unit and such amount may be changed from time to time by a resolution adopted by the governing body. The term "residential" shall include single-family homes, mobile homes and mobile home parks, duplexes and apartment units. Common areas, parking, on-site offices and similar improvements of apartment buildings and apartment complexes shall not be separately assessed. The term "residential" shall not include rooming or boarding houses, dormitories or similar facilities. A recreational vehicle (RV) pad that is available for lease to third parties shall be assessed as one-half of a residential unit. The term "living unit" shall mean one or more rooms in a residential building which are arranged, designed, used or intended for use by one family, and which includes cooking space and lawful sanitary facilities reserved for the occupants thereof. In the event a property that is part residential and part nonresidential, the public works director shall determine the predominate use of the property based on square footage and the entire property shall be assessed as if it were all devoted to the predominate use. 
(2)  Property devoted to any use other than residential, as set forth above, and further described as nonresidential, shall be assessed a monthly fee based upon the number of square feet developed for that particular use and the associated charge as follows: impermeable area of the property divided by the determined ERU (as defined below) equals the NERU (number of equivalent residential units). The NERU is multiplied by the adopted ERU rate to calculate the monthly fee. The ERU rate shall be assessed at the sum of $7.00 per month. The ERU rate will be modified from time to time by Resolution of the governing body. The determined NERU (number of equivalent residential units) is an average square footage of impermeable areas as determined in subparagraph (b) below. The determined ERU is 3,318 square feet of impermeable area and in all cases, the minimum NERU shall be at least one unit for a nonresidential property. For illustration purposes only, a commercial property with 10,000 square feet of impermeable area shall pay a month fee as follows: 
10,000 sq. ft. (impermeable area)/3,318 (determined ERU)= 3.01 (NERU) x 7.00(ERU rate) = $21.09 (monthly fee) 
(b)  In determining the area of property developed for a particular use, the area measured shall include all property contiguous to the particular use, and under the same ownership, except that portion of said property that is both unimproved and legally subject to being subdivided from that portion actually devoted to the primary use. Most nonresidential customers shall be placed in the proper fee category from reviewing billing records, aerial photos and/or tax assessor records. In situations involving extremely large, unusual or questionable properties, and properties with multiple building and multiple utility connections, actual measurements, including impervious areas, may be required and specially determined charges may be assessed for the total monthly fee. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, property owned or leased by the city, the board of public utilities of the city, any county, state or federal agency, any unified school district or any accredited college or university shall not be assessed a storm water utility fee. 
(d)  The monthly storm water utility fees set forth above shall be included as part of the monthly bill for utility services of the city, but shall be identified separately on said billing. Said fees shall be due at the same time as utility services of the city charges are due and the failure to pay said fees shall be considered a failure to pay utility services of the city charges and enforceable pursuant to this Code. In addition, any time utility services of the city are established, or re-established to a property, all fees hereunder shall be paid current, as of the date such service is established or re-established. The storm water utility fee is intended to be exempt from or not subject to the retailers' sales tax and should be interpreted accordingly. In the event that it is determined that retailers' sales tax applies to the storm water utility fee or state law is amended, sales tax and any arrearages owed by the city shall be added to the fee after adoption of a resolution of the governing body authorizing the same. 
(e)  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of their storm drainage fee or who believes that a reduction is justified based on the criteria in this section may appeal the determination of their fee to the director of public works or designee ("director"). The appeal shall be in writing and state the full basis of the challenge. The director or designee shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The director or designee, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing the dwelling units, total property area and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the director or designee. Based upon information provided, the director or designee shall make a determination of the storm drainage fee for such property. The property owner shall have the burden of proof in any challenge of the calculation of the storm water utility fee and any successful challenge shall be prospective for any fee due after the date the written appeal is received. Failure to timely object or notify the director of a removal of impermeable surfaces shall be deemed a waiver. No refunds shall be issued. The director or designee shall notify parties in writing of the decision within 20 working days. 
(f)  A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the director or designee to the governing body. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days of the date of the written decision of the director or designee to the governing body. Such appeal shall be in writing specifying any and all legal and factual basis for such appeal and filed with the director. Any basis not stated shall be deemed waived. A hearing on such appeal shall be held within 30 days from the date of filing and the applicant shall be given seven days advance notice of the time and date of such hearing. The governing body may establish such rules for any hearing that it deems necessary. Within ten days after the conclusion of such hearing, the governing body shall render a decision in writing that sets forth findings that support its decision. The decision of the governing body shall be final and any further appeal of such decision shall be to the district court pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d).

Sec. 86-354. - Storm water utility fund. 
    The revenue generated by this storm water utility fee shall be held in a special fund, which is hereby created to be known as the storm water utility fund. Such funds shall be used only for the uses, functions and expenses as authorized for the city's storm water utility in its Charter Ordinance or otherwise in this Code. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to limit or restrict the city's ability to use and obtain other sources of funds for the same or similar purposes.

The city clerk will notify the owners of such trees in writing. Such pruning, maintaining or removal shall be done by the owners, at their own expense, within 30 days after the date of service of such notice. In the event of failure of abutting property owners to comply with such provisions, the city shall have the authority to remove such trees and report the cost of such pruning, maintaining or removal to the city clerk. The costs of such pruning, maintaining or removal shall be paid by the owner of the abutting property or shall be assessed and charged against the abutting property on which the tree is located. The city clerk shall, at the time of certifying other city taxes to the county clerk, certify the unpaid costs and the county clerk shall extend the costs on the tax rolls of the county against the abutting property.

(b)  All of the provisions of this article for the removal of infected or infested trees shall also apply and extend to any and all dead trees located upon private property and upon streets, alleys and avenues, which are a hazard and which may or may not be infested or infected, and the owners and abutting property owners shall be required to remove the dead trees, and for default thereof, the city shall then proceed to remove the dead trees and tax the costs thereof against the owner of the abutting property as provided in section 90-111.

Section 10. - Assessment ordinance; installments; pay-in period. 
    Assessments for sidewalks constructed pursuant to this ordinance shall be made by ordinance, which shall provide for certification of the assessments to the county clerk and payment of such assessments in not more than five annual installments.

Section 12. - Severability. 
    If any phrase, clause, paragraph or section of this ordinance is declared unconstitutional or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, it is hereby declared that the governing body would have enacted the remaining portions of this ordinance without the phrase, clause, paragraph or section so held unconstitutional or invalid.

ACCESSORY APARTMENT: An accessory use dwelling unit that may be constructed
wholly within, or may be detached from, a principal single-family dwelling unit
which shall be subject to the following standards:
1) A maximum of one accessory apartment may be allowed on the same zoning lot
as a single-family dwelling unit.
2) The appearance of an accessory apartment shall be compatible with the
principal dwelling and the character of the neighborhood.
3) The lot on which the accessory apartment is to be located must meet the
minimum lot area as required for the lot size in the relevant zoning
district.
4) The off-street parking space and standards required for Section 5-101A1
must be met.
5) Separate or shared utility connections may be utilized subject to meeting
all requirements of the current building codes for the City.
6) An accessory apartment shall remain accessory to and under the same
ownership as the principal single-family dwelling unit and not be
subdivided or sold as a condominium. A suitable deed restriction stating
this restriction must be filed with the McPherson County Register of Deeds
prior to issuance of any occupancy certificate for the accessory
apartment.
ADULT CARE HOME: A residential facility operated as a home occupation for not
more than four adults wherein care and activities are provided on an hourly or
daily basis or limited nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis. Such homes
may also be referred to as "home plus" and are licensed under regulations
established and administered by the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment. Standards for such definitions may be periodically amended by
changes in state regulations. Care for numbers greater than four may be
approved as a Special Use by the Planning Commission.
AGRICULTURE: (Inside the City) The use of land for growing crops in the open,
horticulture, nurseries, truck farms and accessory uses, including the
structures not in a designated floodplain for carrying out agricultural
operations; provided, however, such agricultural use shall not include the
following uses: (See Section 3-100E4 for Exemptions.)
a. The maintenance and operation of commercial greenhouses or hydroponic
farms, except in zoning districts where permitted.
b. Retail sales as an accessory use, unless the same are otherwise permitted
by these regulations.
c. The feeding of garbage to animals.
d. The feeding, grazing or sheltering of domestic animals or fowl, e.g.,
horses, cows, swine, goats, chickens, pigeons, rabbits or fur bearing
animals, but not including cats and dogs and other pets; unless such
animals or fowl are otherwise permitted by City laws or regulations.
e. The operation or maintenance of a stockyard or commercial feedlot.
2-5
Farmhouses are considered to be single-family dwellings.
AGRICULTURE: (Outside the City) The use of a tract of land in excess of three
acres under one ownership where the principle activity is to produce income
from the growing of crops, horticulture, nurseries, truck farms or the raising
of fish, poultry and cattle or other livestock, but not including feedlots.
Such definition includes the structures which are not in a designated
floodplain that are necessary for carrying on farming operations and, as an
accessory use, the dwelling of the owner or operator of the premises including
modular and residential design manufactured homes used as the principal farm
dwelling. Application may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
conditional use for locating a manufactured/mobile home with such an existing
dwelling for additional assistance on the farm or ranch. (See Section 3-103N6.)
The retail sale of items produced as part of the farming operation is permitted
including the operation of commercial greenhouses and hydroponic farming. Such
definition shall not include lands used for recreational purposes or rural home
sites whose primary purpose is for residential use and not the production of
income from a farming operation. Privately owned natural wildlife habitats and
reserves are also considered an agricultural use. So long as such land,
related structures and accessory dwelling(s) are used for such bona fide
agricultural purposes, these regulations do not require a zoning permit or an
occupancy certificate, nor do they establish any other rule or regulation
contrary to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-715b. To assist the Zoning
Administrator in determining if a proposed building, structure or use meets the
definition of agriculture, any applicant seeking agricultural exempt status
must complete and file a certificate of compliance. Any person aggrieved by a
decision of the Zoning Administrator in interpreting the definition of
agriculture may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination.
Surrounding nonagricultural landowners should be aware that Kansas is a "rightto-
farm" state under K.S.A. 2-3201, et seq. which limits nuisance suits and
injunctions if an agricultural activity is being conducted in conformity with
federal, state, and local laws. (See FEEDLOT, Section 3-100E4 for Exemptions
and Section 3-103N6 for accessory dwelling(s) to agricultural land.)

LOT: See Lot, Zoning.
LOT AREA: The area of a horizontal plane bounded by the front, side and rear
lot lines.
LOT, CORNER: A lot abutting upon two or more streets at their intersection.
(See LOT LINE, REAR and YARD, FRONT.)
LOT COVERAGE: That percentage of a lot which, when viewed directly from above,
would be covered by a principal or accessory building or any part thereof,
excluding projecting roof eaves.
LOT DEPTH: The distance between the midpoints of the front lot line and the
midpoint of the rear lot line.
LOT, INTERIOR: A lot other than a corner lot.

(See LOT, CORNER.)
LOT LINE, REAR: The lot line that is most distant from and is or is most
nearly, parallel to the front lot line. If a rear lot line is less than 10
feet long or if the lot comes to a point at the rear, the rear lot line shall
be a line at least 10 feet long, lying wholly within the lot, parallel to the
front line. If a zoning lot has two or more front lot lines, the owner or
developer shall designate the yard which is to be the rear yard and/or side
yard.
LOT LINE, SIDE: A lot line which is neither a front lot line nor a rear lot
line. (See LOT LINE, REAR.)
LOT OF RECORD: A lot which is part of a subdivision, the plat of which has
been recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds or a parcel of land
described by metes and bounds of which the deed was recorded prior to adoption
of these regulations.
LOT, REVERSE FRONTAGE: A lot whose rear lot line also serves as the street line
for a limited access highway or street. With complete access control on the
rear lot line, the abutting yard is considered to be a rear yard. (See LOT,
THROUGH and YARD, REAR.)
LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS: Restrictions on the dimensions of lots including (1)
minimum lot area, width and depth; and (2) maximum density. Lot area, width
and depth establish the minimum size of the zoning lot on which a structure or
use or two or more structures or uses, may be constructed or established.
2-14
LOT, THROUGH: A lot which has a pair of opposite lot lines along two substantially
parallel streets and which is not a corner lot. On a through lot,
both street lines shall be deemed front lot lines, but in the case of two or
more contiguous through lots, there shall be a common front lot line.
Sometimes referred to as a double frontage lot. (See LOT, REVERSE FRONTAGE.)
LOT WIDTH: The distance on a horizontal plane between the side lot lines
measured at right angles to the lot depth at the established front yard setback
line.
LOT, ZONING: A parcel of land that is designated by its owner or developer at
the time of applying for a zoning permit as a tract all of which is to be used,
developed or built upon as a unit under single ownership. As long as it
satisfies the above requirements, such lot may consist of: (1) a single lot of
record, or (2) a portion of a lot of record, or (3) a combination of complete
lots of record, complete lots and portions of lots of record, or portions of
lots of record.
MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME: A factory-built structure or structures equipped
with the necessary service connections and made so as to be transportable as a
unit or units on its own running gear and designed to be used as a dwelling
unit with or without a permanent foundation. The transportation system is
designed so that the home may be moved from time to time at the convenience of
the owner. The term shall include two or more separately towed units which are
designed to be bolted or otherwise fastened together to form a complete living
unit. Such homes are built on a chassis consisting of drawbar and coupling
mechanism, frame (e.g., steel I-beams), running gear assembly and lights.
Removal of any or all of these component parts does not change the definition.
All such homes shall be either skirted according to the manufacturer's design
and construction standards or placed on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter
foundation and, according to standards of the State of Kansas under K.S.A.
75-1226, et seq., as amended, shall be anchored to the ground or secured to a
permanent-type foundation. All manufactured homes must meet the standards of
the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards of 1976. When
such homes do not meet the standards, the industry refers to them as "mobile
homes." It is the intent of this definition to distinguish between references
made in these regulations to "manufactured" and "mobile" homes as well as to
"residential-design manufactured" homes also defined in this section. Additions
may be made to such homes for patios, porches, carports, garages, storage
structures and living space provided such additions are designed and
constructed by a manufactured home factory or meet applicable City building
codes when constructed on the site. Overhead structures which cover or enclose
a home are not permitted; however, a protective roof covering which is used to
remedy a deteriorating roof condition is permitted. Under no circumstances
shall two or more single-wide manufactured homes be permitted to connect
together in any manner on the same zoning lot, nor shall such homes be attached
to or integrated with the design of a site-built dwelling unit. (See
RESIDENTIAL-DESIGN MANUFACTURED HOME.)
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK: Any area, piece, parcel, tract, or plot of ground
equipped as required for support of manufactured/mobile homes and used or intended
to be used by one or more occupied home. Such parks shall be under one
ownership and control, but under no circumstances shall the home spaces be sold
or offered for sale individually. The definition of a park does not include a
sales area on which unoccupied homes, whether new or used, are parked for the
2-15
purposes of storage, inspection or sale, unless approved as a conditional use
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A manufactured/mobile home may, however,
remain on a space for purposes of sale by the resident owner.
MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A subdivision which is platted for development
as individually owned lots for manufactured homes which meet the National
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and are placed on
permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundations. Whereas such homes can be used

more full-time professional persons engaged in the diagnosis, care and
treatment of physical or mental diseases or ailments of human beings;
including, but not limited to doctors of medicine, dentists, chiropractors,
osteopaths, optometrists, podiatrists and naturopaths, and in which no patients
are lodged overnight, but which may include an apothecary.
MINI-STORAGE FACILITY: A building or group of buildings that contain varying
sizes of individual, compartmentalized and controlled-access stalls and/or

of vehicles is part of such a business.
MODULAR HOME: A single-family dwelling or duplex building located on a
permanent foundation and connected to public utilities, consisting of preselected,
prefabricated units or modules, and transported to and/or assembled
on the site of its foundation; in contrast to a residential building which is
custom built on the site of its permanent location; and also in contrast to a
manufactured home, of any width located on its permanent foundation. In
general, such modular homes shall have exterior building materials and somewhat
similar appearance to custom built residential buildings and meet the standards
of the City building codes.
MOTOR VEHICLE IMPOUND LOT: A lot, land or structure, or any part thereof, used
for the storing of operable or inoperable motor vehicles that are held on the
property for the purpose of impound and/or routine and periodic sales occurring
at least three times a year. Materials not meeting the definition of motor
vehicle, such as appliances, bulky waste, junk, or other kinds of machinery or
equipment not defined as a motor vehicle are prohibited from being parked,
stored, or placed on property approved for use as a motor vehicle impound lot.
A motor vehicle impound lot is further subject to the following use
regulations:
a. Only a towing company or auto insurance pool operator or similar business
properly licensed under applicable law may operate a motor vehicle
impound lot;
b. Motor vehicles stored on a motor vehicle impound lot shall not be
dismantled, parted out or salvaged;
c. The site must be enclosed by a fence not less than eight feet in height

OCCUPANCY CERTIFICATE: A certificate by which the Zoning Administrator
certifies that upon completion of an applicant's proposed structure and/or use
or a change in use that it complies with these regulations and, therefore, may
be occupied and/or used. When applicable, such a certificate may be combined
with the issuance of a certificate of occupancy as required by a building code.
(See Section 8-103H for Change in Use and Section 9-101B for Occupancy
Certificates.)
OUTDOOR STORAGE: The storage of goods and materials outside of any building or
structure when specifically permitted by these regulations, but not including

recreational vehicles or utility trailers for sale at any location in any
residential district. (See Section 5-100A1 for utilization of parking
facilities exemption and 6-100B13 for outdoor storage.)
PATIO OR TERRACE: An unroofed, paved area immediately adjacent to a dwelling
unit and overlooking a lawn or garden.
PERMITTED USE: A use of a structure or land which is permitted outright within
a zoning district because of its suitability to the purpose of the other uses
so designated. When a use may appear to be classified under more than one
permitted use as well as a special or conditional use, the most specific
description or narrowly defined wording is applicable. The Zoning
Administrator is authorized to issue zoning permits and occupancy certificates
for such permitted uses when all other requirements of the regulations have
been met.
PORTABLE STORAGE UNIT: A former metal international shipping container
repainted a neutral color which is used for general storage purposes. Such a
unit requires location on the ground, but is not permanently attached to the

porch or entry based on the percentages determined by the Zoning Administrator.
On a corner lot, the street shall mean that street on which the
frontage of the facade has been designated for the household address
number. External roofing and siding material of such garage, porch or
entry shall be similar in appearance to the materials on the roofing and
siding of the residential-design manufactured home.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "manufactured home", when used by
itself, shall not include a "residential-design manufactured home" as herein
defined. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to preempt or
supersede valid restrictive covenants running with the land as to the placement

SPECIAL USE: A use of a structure or land which is not permitted outright
within a zoning district because of characteristics that might have an adverse
affect upon nearby properties or the future development of the district unless
certain conditions can be placed on the use which would make it suitable to the
purpose of the district and compatible to the other uses so designated. Such
uses are "special" in that they are often large, one-of-a-kind, private or
public uses serving as community facilities and/or whose location would have
planning implications for a neighborhood or the entire City. Designated
special uses are processed in the same manner as zoning amendments, except that
a particular use is applied for within a district and conditions may be
recommended by the Planning Commission and attached to their approval by the
Governing Body. (See Section 11-101 for Special Uses.)

commercial uses are the main permitted uses. References to "industrial
districts" shall mean those districts in which industrial uses are the main
permitted use. The "planned unit development district" and the "floodplain
regulated areas" are considered as overlay zones to be used in conjunction
with the other districts.
B. Zoning Maps.
1. The boundaries of the districts described in Article 4 are as indicated
on the Official Zoning Map(s) which is on file with the Zoning
Administrator and identified on its face as part of these regulations.
The zoning map(s) with all notations, references and other matters shown
thereon is as much a part of these regulations as if specifically set
forth herein. (See Section 9-100A9 for zoning map(s) certificate and
revisions.)
2. It is the intent of these regulations that the entire area of the zoning
jurisdiction, including all the land and water areas, rivers, streets,
alleys and railroads and other rights-of-way, be included in the
districts established in these regulations. Any area not shown on the
zoning map(s) as being included in any district shall be deemed to be in
the most restrictive district.
C. Boundaries. In the event that uncertainties exist with respect to the
intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Official Zoning
Map(s), the following rules shall apply:
1. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following roads,
streets, alleys, easements, railroads, rivers, streams or lakes, such
boundaries shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof,
unless otherwise indicated.
2. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines;
or section, half-section or quarter-section lines; such lines shall be
construed to be said boundaries.
3. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
3-3
boundaries as stated in Sections 3-101C1 or 2 above, the district boundaries
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning
map, unless an exact distance is shown.
D. Zoning of Rights-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and
railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be
deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting them.
Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or railroad
right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of
the abutting property up to such centerline.
102 General Requirements for All Zoning Districts.
A. Permitted Uses. No structure shall hereafter be built, moved or structurally
altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied or
designed for use or occupancy except for a use that is permitted within the
zoning district in which the structure or land is located or provided for
otherwise in these regulations.
B. Special Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a special
use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established, and no existing
special use shall hereafter be changed to another special use in such
district, unless a special use is approved in the same manner as for an
amendment to a zoning district. The latter procedure is set forth in Section
11-101 with the additional requirement that all conditions further imposed
upon the special use be made a part of the effectuating ordinance.
C. Conditional Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a
conditional use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established, and no
existing conditional use shall hereafter be changed to another conditional
use in such district, unless a conditional use as an exception is approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in Section 10-108.
D. Lot Sizes.
1. No structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be built, moved or
structurally altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used,
occupied, arranged or designed for use of occupancy on a zoning lot,
unless otherwise provided for in these regulations, which in its district
is:
a. Smaller area than the minimum area or minimum lot area per dwelling
unit required;
b. Narrower than the minimum lot width required; or
c. Shallower than the minimum lot depth required.
2. Where independent dwelling units are to be sold as condominiums, minimum
lot size requirements shall not apply to each individual ownership, but
shall be applied collectively to the common open space surrounding the
structure(s) such that the total open space is an aggregate of the
3-4
minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit; however, the minimum
lot width and depth for the district shall be applied to the entire
zoning lot.
E. Bulk Regulations. In these regulations, bulk requirements are expressed in
terms of maximum structure height, maximum lot coverage, minimum setbacks and
minimum front, side and rear yards.
1. No structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be built, moved or
structurally altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used,
occupied or designed for use or occupancy:
a. That would exceed the maximum lot coverage percentage or the maximum
structure height specified for the zoning district in which the
structure is located, unless exempted by the definition of maximum
height, or
b. That would provide any minimum setback of a front, side or rear yard
that is less than that specified for the zoning district in which
such structure or use of land is located or maintained, except as
front yard setbacks may be applied in Sections 3-103B and C and
front and side yard setbacks for nonconforming structures and uses
in Article 8.
2. Where independent dwelling units are to be sold as condominiums, bulk
regulations shall not apply to each individual ownership, but shall be
applied to the entire zoning lot.
F. Use Limitations. No permitted, special or conditional use hereafter
established, altered, extended, enlarged or moved shall be operated or
designed so as to conflict with the use limitations for the zoning district
in which such use is or will be located. No permitted, special or
conditional use already established on the effective date of these
regulations shall be altered, extended or enlarged so as to conflict, or
further conflict with, the use limitations for the zoning district in which
such use is located. (See Sections 8-102, 103 and 106.)
G. Off-Street Parking and Loading. No structure shall hereafter be built or
moved and no structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied or designed
for use or occupancy, unless the minimum off-street parking and off-street
loading space required by Article 5 are provided. No structure or use
already established on the effective date of these regulations shall be
enlarged, unless the minimum off-street parking and loading space which would
be required by Article 5 are provided.
H. Accessory Structures or Uses. No accessory structures or use, as defined in
Article 6, shall hereafter be built, altered, extended, enlarged or moved,
unless such accessory structure or use is permitted by Article 6.
3-5
I. Temporary Structures or Uses. No temporary structure or use shall hereafter
be built, altered, extended, enlarged or moved, unless such temporary
structure or use is permitted by Article 6 of these regulations.
J. Home Occupations. No home occupation, as defined by Article 6, shall
hereafter be established, altered, extended, enlarged or moved in any
residential district, unless such home occupation complies with the permitted
uses, conditions and use limitations as provided for in Article 6.
K. Signs. No signs shall hereafter be built, and no existing signs shall be
altered, enlarged or moved, unless such sign complies, or will thereafter
comply, with the restrictions imposed by Article 7.
103 Miscellaneous Requirements.
A. Number of Structures and Uses on a Zoning Lot.
1. Whenever a zoning lot is used for a single-family detached or attached
dwelling, two-family dwelling or any type of manufactured or mobile home,
only one principal structure and use may be located on the lot, but only
when the structure and use conform to all requirements of the district in
which the lot is located.
2. Whenever a zoning lot is used for other than a residential unit as
described in Section 3-103A1 above, more than one principal structure and
use may be located on the lot in common ownership, but only when the
structures and uses conform to all requirements of the district in which
the lot is located.
3. Whenever any structures are developed as condominiums, more than one
principal structure may be located on the lot; provided, the definition
of a condominium in Section 2-102 is met as well as the requirements of
Sections 3-102D2 and E2.
B. Platted Building Setback Lines. If a recorded subdivision plat imposes a
building setback line or a front yard for a lot which is different from the
minimum setback or yard required by the applicable section of these
regulations, then, notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations,
the minimum building setback or front yard shall be the same as that shown on
such subdivision plat; provided, that it has been recorded and not otherwise
been officially vacated.
C. Average Setback in Existing Residential Districts.
1. On streets where a front yard more than that required by these
regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a
frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion
of the street line between two intersecting streets, there shall be
maintained a front yard setback of not less than the average setback of
3-6
the existing structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be
interpreted to require a front yard setback of more than 50 feet.
2. On streets where a front yard less than that required by these
regulations has been maintained for existing structures on lots having a
frontage of 50% or more of the total frontage on one side of that portion
of the street line between two intersecting streets, the front yard
setback need not be greater than the average setback of the existing
structures; provided, that these regulations shall not be interpreted to
permit a front yard setback of less than 15 feet, however, in the case of
the entrance side of a garage, the setback shall not be less than 18
feet.
D. Yard Requirements for Open Land. If a zoning lot is, or will be, occupied by
a permitted use without structures, then the minimum front, side and rear
yards that would otherwise be required for the zoning lot shall be provided
and maintained, unless some other provision of these regulations requires or
permits a different minimum front, side or rear yard. Such yards shall not
be required on zoning lots used for open public recreation areas.
E. Restrictions on Allocation and Disposition of Required Yards or Open Space.
1. No part of the lot area, or of a yard, or other open space, or off-street
parking or loading space provided in connection with any structure or use
in order to comply with these regulations shall, by reason of change of
ownership or otherwise, be included as part of the minimum lot area, or
of a yard, or open space, or off-street parking or loading space required
for any other structure or use, except as specifically provided herein.
2. All of the lot area and all yards and other open spaces provided in
connection with any structure or use in order to comply with these
regulations shall be located on the same zoning lot as such structure or
use.
3. No part of the lot area, or of the yard, other open space, or off-street
parking or loading space provided in connection with any structure or
use, including but not limited to any structure or use existing on the
effective date of these regulations or of any amendment thereof, shall be
subsequently reduced below, or further reduced if already less than, the
minimum requirements of these regulations for the equivalent new
construction.
F. Permitted Obstructions in Required Yards. The following shall not be
considered to be obstructions when located in a required yard:
1. In all yards: Open terraces or patios not over four feet above the
average level of the adjoining ground, but not including a permanent roof
over a terrace or patio; awnings; canopies including underlying islands
for petroleum pumps; steps four feet or less above grade which are
necessary for access to a permanent structure or for access to a lot or
to a lot from a street or alley including access to conform to the
standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as
3-7
incorporated into state statutes; one story bay windows and overhanging
eaves and gutters projecting 36 inches or less into the yard; chimneys,
window wells, wing walls, and daylight windows projecting 36 inches or
less into the yard; arbors and trellises; flagpoles* and basketball
goals; ornamental light or gas fixtures; parking, when permitted by
Article 5; accessory and temporary uses, when permitted by Article 6;
signs, when permitted by Article 7; and when otherwise specifically
permitted by the district regulations. Private garages, carports, patio
covers, porches, and decks are not permitted obstructions.
2. In any yard except a front yard: Accessory uses; children's recreational
and laundry drying equipment; and open and closed fences not exceeding
six feet in height.
3. Fences in a front yard: In any agricultural district, no limitation or
permit required. In all residential districts, application may be made
for a conditional use to the Board of Zoning Appeals for all types of
fences consistent with proper safety and aesthetic concerns. In any
business district, application may be made for a conditional use to the
Board of Zoning Appeals for all types of fences. In any industrial
district, open and closed fences are permitted which do not exceed eight
feet in height. Additional security design measures may be placed above
the allowed eight feet.
4. Construction standard for all fences: No fence shall be constructed
which will constitute a hazard to traffic or a danger to persons or
animals.
5. Conditional use for fences: The Board of Zoning Appeals may as a
conditional use approve the construction of higher fences in all yards
and in any district if the Board finds that the public welfare is
preserved.
G. Lot Size Requirements and Bulk Regulations for Utility Facilities.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these regulations, none of the
following utility or communications facilities shall be required to comply
fully with the lot size requirements and bulk regulations of the zoning
district in which they are located, except as may be determined by the Board
of Zoning Appeals where a conditional use is required in certain districts
and by subsection three of the definition for height, maximum in Section
2-102:
1. Communications structures
2. Electric and telephone substations.
3. Gas regulator stations.
4. Pumping stations.
5. Water towers or standpipes.
Flags, when flown, shall be subject to the requirements of Public Law 94-344, 94th Congress. S.J. Res. 49.
Flagpoles are subject to the applicable zoning district height restrictions and may not be located within vision
triangles. Flag size shall be such that no obstruction to sight lines is created for any vehicle entering,
exiting, or driving upon any public thoroughfare.
3-8
H. Access to Business and Industrial Districts. No land which is located in a
residential district shall be used for a driveway, walkway or access purpose
to any land which is located in any business or industrial district.
I. Annexed Land. All land which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall
remain in its current county zoning classification until such time as the
property owner, Planning Commission or Governing Body may file an application
for rezoning to a City zoning classification. The Planning Commission may
initiate an application(s) to determine the proper zoning. Rezoning may also
be considered during the process of annexation. While the Planning
Commission may hold their required public hearing on a rezoning amendment or
a special use prior to annexation, the zoning ordinance approving the
amendment or special use cannot be effectuated until the land is first
officially annexed by a separate annexation ordinance. While both ordinances
may be published on the same day, the annexation ordinance must be published
first if they are published on separate days. (See Appendix for Table of
Comparability of Zoning Districts.)
J. Sewer and Water Facilities. All principal structures built hereafter within
the City limits and on adjacent zoning lots shall be served by and connected
to the City's sewer and water system, if such facilities can be feasibly
provided as may be determined by the Governing Body.
K. Dedication of Rights-of-Way and Easements. As a condition related to a
rezoning amendment or a special use, the dedication of additional street
rights-of-way; easements for utilities, drainage, access control, fire lanes,
building setback lines and other purposes; and the construction, removal or
replacement of public improvements necessary to the proper development of the
property, may be required either by platting or replatting the land according
to the City Subdivision Regulations or, in lieu of platting, by a legal
document effectuating such dedications and improvements. Such condition may
be required whether the property is being divided or held in single
ownership. A stated time limit not exceeding one year may be established to
ensure compliance with the above conditions during which time the effectuation
of the zoning amendment or special use having been approved with such
conditions by the Governing Body shall be withheld from publication by the
Clerk. Failure to comply with the conditions during the stated period shall
result in making the zoning amendment or special use null and void. No
extension of the time period may be granted without reapplication.
L. Floodplain Requirements. Within any floodplain area as delineated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, no use of land shall commence or no
structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended,
enlarged or moved under these regulations, unless it also complies with the
Floodplain Regulations. (See pages A-25 to A-45 for Floodplain Regulations.)
M. Moving Structures. No structure shall be moved into the Zoning Jurisdiction,
nor from one location to another location within the Jurisdiction, unless
such structure shall, when relocated, be made to conform fully with these
regulations and other applicable codes of the City including any building
3-9
codes. No zoning permit shall be issued, unless in the opinion of the Zoning
Administrator the height, age, architectural style and texture of the materials
pertaining to the outward appearance of such structure reasonably
conform to other buildings in the block or surrounding area to which it is to
be moved and in the block or area opposite, to such an extent that its
relocation shall not be detrimental to the appearance or have no substantial
adverse effect on property values to the adjacent properties. (See City Code
on moving structures.)
N. Replacement or Location of Manufactured/Mobile Homes. Notwithstanding other
provisions of these regulations, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to
issue a zoning permit for a manufactured/mobile home under the following
provisions; except, that all such homes must meet the floodplain regulation
requirements and none may be replaced in a floodway overlay boundary:
1. Wherever a manufactured/mobile home is moved from a zoning lot within a
district in which it is a permitted use, another manufactured/mobile home
meeting the requirements of the district may be moved onto the lot at any
time; provided, such home is skirted or placed on a permanent-type,
enclosed perimeter foundation.
2. In the case of a lawful, nonconforming manufactured/mobile home use, such
a move must take place within 180 days from the date that the previous
manufactured/mobile home was moved off the lot, otherwise such use shall
not thereafter be reestablished and, when so moved in, shall be skirted
or placed on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundation. In
reestablishing such a home use, any existing nonconforming lot size
requirements or bulk regulations shall not be increased in nonconformity
and no newly acquired land can be used for placement of such a home.
3. No manufactured/mobile home, or portion thereof, shall be moved onto any
lot or parcel for storage purposes in any district and no such home shall
be temporarily located in any district not otherwise permitting such
homes. These provisions do not preclude the use of prefabricated mobile
structures for offices in business or industrial districts, but not
manufactured/mobile homes unless specifically permitted.
4. In the event of disasters, such as fires, tornados or floods, whereby
expediency is an important factor, a manufactured/mobile home may be
located temporarily in an agricultural district only at the discretion of
the Zoning Administrator with appropriate conditions attached and for a
stated period of time.
5. Where an unusual hardship is shown, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
approve a conditional use in the agricultural district only for a
manufactured/mobile home as an accessory use to be located on a lot or
tract with an existing dwelling for a stated period of time. A time
period may be extended upon request to the Board of Zoning Appeals
without further notice or fee.
6. As an accessory use to a principal residential building under construction
or reconstruction for not more than 18 months in any
agricultural district only. Such manufactured/mobile home must be
removed from the premises at the end of the permitted period or at the
3-10
end of the construction period, whichever occurs first, unless a renewal
of the permit is approved.
7. As an accessory use to a principal farm dwelling on agricultural land as
defined herein for outside the City, application may be made to the Board
of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use for locating a
manufactured/mobile home with such an existing dwelling for additional
assistance on the farm or ranch. No zoning permit is required; however,
a certificate of compliance is necessary to determine the status of the
land for the agricultural exemption. (See Section 2-102 for definition
of AGRICULTURE (Outside the City).)
O. Vision Triangle. On all corner lots in all districts, no use of land shall
commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally
altered, extended, enlarged or moved after the effective date of these
regulations unless it also conforms to the requirements of the vision
triangle as defined by Section 2-102.
104 Screening and Landscaping. Screening and/or landscaping shall be provided when a
zoning permit is issued on all properties developed for multiple-family,
manufactured home park and all nonresidential uses when such uses are established
on property within or adjacent to any residential districts in accordance with
standards and procedures as listed below. In anticipation of a need for screening,
such matters are proper subjects to be discussed and, if deemed desirable,
decided at any hearing for a zoning district amendment or a special use. In
addition to the requirement for screening as stated above, screening may further
be required at such a hearing to preserve the value of an existing use or the
potential for future development of any adjacent land or land across a
right-of-way.
A. Screening shall be provided along all side or rear lot lines adjacent to such
residential districts.
B. Landscaping shall be provided along a front lot line to the depth of at least
10 feet whenever such front lot line is adjacent to or across from such
residential districts. No other uses except driveways and signs as permitted
by Article 7 shall be allowed in such a landscaped area.
C. Screening shall be provided on all required development sufficient to
reasonably hide from ground level view all loading docks, trash receptacles,
outdoor storage, outdoor display, outdoor working areas, parking spaces and
similar uses from such residential districts.
D. Screening on the side or rear lot line may be reduced in height and intensity
in the front yard area extending to the front lot line, i.e., the street
right-of-way; however, screening shall not be required along such lot lines
in that portion of the front yard which may be landscaped.
E. Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley, screening may be
omitted at driveways deemed essential for ingress and egress to uses
established on the property.
3-11
F. Screening may consist of fencing and/or landscaping provided that such
screening will serve to adequately reduce:
1. The visual effects on the environment caused by adjacent nonresidential
or higher density residential uses;
2. Noise;
3. Lighting;
4. Glare; and
5. Blowing trash.
G. All screening and landscaping shall meet the requirements of the vision
triangle in Section 3-103 O.
H. Landscaping along the front lot line shall involve bringing the soil surface
to a smooth finished grade and installing sufficient trees, shrubs, ground
cover and grass to soften building lines, provide shade and generally produce
a pleasing visual effect of the premises.
I. The location of plantings shall reasonably avoid future conflicts at mature
growth with public utilities, signage and lighting.
J. Irrigation shall be provided to aid in establishment and maintenance of
plantings in plant beds. When using timed or automatic irrigation systems,
it is recommended to include a rain sensor device. (NOTE: This paragraph excluded
by Ordinance 3016, included in the appendix.)
K. The selection of landscape materials shall consider the "mature" growth and
habit of such plants so that vegetation will not overhang or obstruct the
public street or a sidewalk area in such a manner as to conflict with
pedestrian and vehicular access.
L. The type of fencing should be compatible with the kind and intensity of the
land use and the architectural style of the development and adjacent
properties.
M. Whenever such screening is required, a screening plan for the area shall
accompany the application for a zoning permit. Such plan shall be
transmitted to the Planning Commission for their review and approval prior to
the issuance of the zoning permit.
N. The screening plan shall be in such detail as to provide enough information
to determine if the plan meets the above criteria. Such plan shall contain
the location, type and height of any fence and the location, mature size and
the type of any plant materials along with their common and botanical names.
The sizing, grading and condition of the plant materials shall be specified
according to the American Association of Nurserymen Standards.
O. The Planning Commission may, in its discretion, temporarily or permanently
waive the requirements for screening and/or landscaping if:
1. The adjacent land use in the residential district may not necessitate nor
benefit from such a requirement; or
2. The adjacent land use may already have provided adequate screening for
which additional screening may be a duplication; or
3-12
3. The future land use for the adjacent area can not readily be determined
at this time and that upon mutual agreement of the Planning Commission
and the applicant, that the requirements may be waived and the matter
reviewed at a specified date in the future. In the meanwhile, the
Planning Commission shall require that either a letter of assurance or a
covenant be submitted to run with the land; or a guarantee in the form of
a corporate security bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other
security be submitted to ensure that such requirements will be met when a
determination is made. The Planning Commission may determine the
sufficiency of the assurance based on the length of time anticipated
before a decision, the size and cost of the potential work involved, and
the need to ensure that the requirement is met regardless of any change
in ownership.
4. Section 3-104M3 above shall not prevent the Planning Commission from
requiring temporary screening on all or a portion of a side or rear yard
wherein a nonresidential use is proposed for development adjacent to an
existing single-family dwelling and thereby a potential nuisance or
hazard may be created for the homeowner.
P. All plant materials shall be healthy and/or fencing in place prior to
issuance of an occupancy certificate. A temporary certificate may be issued
as provided for in Section 9-101B2 without the landscaping installation;
provided, written assurances are given which are satisfactory to the Zoning
Administrator that the planting will take place when the proper season
arrives.
Q. Maintenance.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in good
condition all of the required screening and landscaping improvements on
his property. When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that
improvements required by Section 3-104 are not being maintained, it is
his duty to give notice in writing to the property owner. Such notice
shall specify in what manner the improvements are in need of maintenance
and a date for compliance. The owner shall have not less than 30 days to
comply with the notice; provided, however, that any person aggrieved by
any such order and disagreeing with any of the requirements of the
notice, may file an appeal under Section 10-106 within the 30-day filing
period with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. If the owner of the land has failed, refused or neglected to make the
necessary maintenance repairs within the time of the notice or time
designated by the Board, then the Zoning Administrator shall cause such
maintenance to be done to the property. The cost of maintenance shall be
certified by the Administrator to the Clerk, who shall cause the costs to
be assessed against the property on which the maintenance repairs were
made.
R. To assist in reviewing screening and landscape plans, the Planning Commission
may, from time to time, adopt design criteria in the form of policy
statements which may include illustrations.
3-13
105 Site Plan Approval. The purpose and intent of requiring site plan approval before
the start of construction is to encourage the compatible arrangement of buildings,
off-street parking and loading, outdoor display and/or storage, trash disposal,
lighting, signage, landscaping, screening, vehicular and pedestrian access and
drainage on and from the site, any or all of these in a manner that will promote
safety and convenience for the public and will preserve property values of
surrounding properties.
A. Applicability. All principle land uses shall submit site plans for approval
by the Planning Commission except single-family dwellings and duplexes,
unless the latter are arranged in courtyard or grouped settings. Such plans
are applicable to all new developments, as well as major alterations to an
existing site which intensify factors that affect the overall design
relationships as may be determined by the Planning Commission. Minor
revisions to the plans due to unforeseeable circumstances discovered by the
applicant during the implementation of a plan may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator after the initial plan approval by the Planning Commission.
Site plans may be considered concurrently with applications for rezoning
amendments and special uses.
B. Enforcement and Appeal. No zoning permit shall be issued by the Zoning
Administrator until the related site plan is approved by the Planning
Commission. Anyone aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Commission may
appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals within 30 days after the issuance of
the zoning permit for a determination based on the reasonableness of the
conditions attached to the permit. Notification shall be given in the same
manner as required for an appeal case to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See
Section 10-103.)
C. Fee. Processing fee is included in the fee schedule.
D. Submittal Time and Review Comments. Site plans shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator 15 days before a regular Planning Commission meeting so
that they can be distributed to interested parties for review and the
resulting comments summarized by the Zoning Administrator for a report to the
Planning Commission.
E. Number of Plan Copies. A minimum of 15 copies are needed for proper review.
F. Site Plan Requirements: Depict the following information where relevant to
the particular site plan and label accordingly:
1. Oriented to north with north arrow and scale plus dimensions and boundary
lines for the zoning lot.
2. A drainage study pursuant to the adopted Stormwater Management Policies
and Design Criteria for the City of McPherson, Kansas shall be submitted
along with, and as part of, this site plan.
3-14
3. Show the location and dimensions of all rights-of-way, access control,
easements and setback lines either required by these regulations or by
platting or separate instruments.
4. Locate existing and proposed structures by bulk dimensions plus number of
stories, gross floor area and entrances.
5. Show existing and proposed curb cuts, aisles, off-street parking, loading
spaces and walkways, including type of surfacing and number of parking
spaces.
6. Indicate location, height and materials for screening walls or fences and
landscaped areas, including grass, trees and shrubs, according to the
standards described for screening and landscaping in Section 3-104.
7. Show location, direction and intensity of proposed lighting.
8. Locate all major signs by type, height and approximate size.
9. All outdoor trash disposal areas are screened and outdoor storage areas
screened where necessary. Display areas are arranged in a neat and
orderly manner and located appropriately.
10. Certificates as may be designated by the Planning Commission.
11. Landscaping Plan Contents: (see also currently adopted guidelines)

or the applicant for such review, nor shall membership in McPherson
Main Street be a requirement for design review or permit approval.

has had the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
project. The DRC shall either recommend approval or disapproval of the
permit. If the DRC does not recommend the issuance of the permit, the
basis for such negative recommendation shall be stated in writing. The
result of the DRC review shall be included in the project record. If
DRC comments are not received by the Zoning Administrator within the
10-day period following notification, the submittal shall be deemed to
have been recommended by the DRC. However the DRC may request that the
Zoning Administrator extend the time allowed for review if additional
submittal information is required from the applicant or for other
reasons which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, are
reasonable requests. The Zoning Administrator may base the decision to
approve or disapprove the request for a Zoning Permit in part on the
DRC comments. Applicants aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning
Administrator shall have the right to appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals as established in these regulations.

116 PUD Planned Unit Development District. The purpose of the Planned Unit
Development District, herein referred to as a PUD District is: to encourage
innovation in residential, commercial and/or industrial development by
permitting greater variety and flexibility in type, design and layout of
buildings; (2) to encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in
the technology of land development; (3) to encourage development which
incorporates the best features of modern design, while conserving the value of
land; and (4) to provide a procedure which relates the type, design and layout
of residential, commercial and/or industrial development to the particular site
and the particular demand for housing at the time of development in a manner
consistent with the preservation of property values. The PUD District operates
as an overlay zone in conjunction with all of the other districts in that it is
necessary for an area to concurrently be zoned for one or more of the other
districts in addition to the PUD District designation.
A. General Provisions.
1. The Governing Body may by ordinance approve the establishment of a PUD
District on any parcel or tract of land which is suitable for and of
sufficient size to be planned and developed, or redeveloped, as a unit
and in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of these
regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan.
2. A PUD District may be established for a residential development or for
a general development. A development shall be deemed to be a
residential development when it is limited to dwelling units in
detached, attached or clustered, or multiple-storied structures, or
any combination thereof; and nonresidential uses of a religious,
cultural, recreational and business character that are primarily
designed and intended to serve the residents of the residential
development. A development shall be deemed to be a general development
when it contains major business and/or industrial structures and uses
exclusively, or when it blends residential structures or dwelling
units in a unified plan with business and/or industrial structures and
uses.
3. As a convenience for all references and filing purposes, the specific
name of the proposed development shall precede all references to is
being a planned unit development district, a preliminary planned
unit development plan, or a final planned unit development plan.
All amendments thereto shall be denoted by adding the word amended
following the name of the development and before any reference to its
status as a district or plan. The letters PUD shall serve as an
acceptable abbreviation for the words planned unit development.
4. Any development that is proposing any of the following criteria shall
be required to be established by approval of a PUD District:
a. To use multiple zoning classifications;
b. Land uses or standards that would not otherwise be allowed in an
existing zoning district;
c. Innovation in a development, but which will preserve property
values in the area;
4-54
d. A development of such a large size and/or intensity of land uses
that, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, the design and
processing of such a development would be facilitated by the
establishment of a PUD District; or
e. Any combination of the above.
This does not preclude a developer from applying for a PUD District
even though these regulations do not require it.
B. Standards and Criteria for Planned Unit Developments.
1. For all planned developments:
a. A development plan of the site that is not inconsistent with the
standards set out in this section or with such general policies or
specific rules and regulations for PUD Districts as may be adopted
from time to time by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body
and placed on public record in the office of the City Clerk shall
prima facie be deemed to have qualified for preliminary approval.
No such policies, rules or regulations shall be revised or added to
which would be applicable to a specific proposal for a PUD District
after an application for preliminary approval of a specific PUD plan
has been filed. A PUD plan shall not be inconsistent with the
following general standards for use of land, and the use, type,
bulk, design and location of buildings, the density or intensity of
use, the common open space, the public facilities and the
development by geographic division of the site:
(1) The PUD District will not substantially injure or damage the
use, value and enjoyment of surrounding property nor hinder
or prevent the development of surrounding property in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) The site will be accessible from public roads that are
adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them
by the proposed development and the streets and driveways on
the site of the proposed development will be adequate to
serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development.
Traffic control signals will be provided without expense to
the City when it is determined that such signals are required
to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets.
(3) The PUD District will not impose an undue burden on public
services and facilities such as fire and police protection.
(4) The entire parcel of land to be occupied by the PUD District
shall be held by a single landowner, or if there are two or
more landowners, the application for such district shall be
filed jointly by all such landowners; however, the holder of
a contract to purchase or other person having an enforceable
4-55
proprietary interest in such land shall also be deemed a
landowner for purposes of these regulations.
(5) The PUD plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements
and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and
density of residential buildings, nonresidential uses and
structures, and public facilities as are necessary for the
welfare of the PUD District and are not inconsistent with the
best interests of the area. Such covenants, easements and
other provisions, if part of the PUD plan as finally
approved, may be modified, removed or released only with the
consent of the Governing Body after a public hearing before
and recommendations by the Planning Commission as provided in
Section 4-107C. All such covenants shall specifically
provide for enforcement by the City in addition to the
landowners within the development.
(6) The Planning Commission may designate divisible geographic
units of the entire parcel of land to be developed as a
unified plan. In the case of residential PUD plans and
general PUD plans which contain residential buildings, the
Planning Commission may permit in each unit deviations from
the number of dwelling units per acre established for the
entire plan; provided that, such deviation shall be adjusted
for in other units of the plan so that the number of dwelling
units per acre authorized for the entire PUD plan is not
affected.
(7) For all business and industrial uses proposed for development
within the plan, the standards and extent of uses shall not
exceed the least restrictive requirements for the specific
use as provided for in the business and industrial districts
of these zoning regulations unless they meet the provisions
of Sections 4-107B 1a(12) and 4-107C9.
(8) The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas,
walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities shall be
compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a
PUD plan not used for structures, parking and loading areas,
or access ways, shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
(9) When business or industrial structures or uses in a PUD
District abut a residential district or residential buildings
in the same development, screening shall be provided. In no
event shall a business or industrial structure in a PUD
District be located nearer than 100 feet to a residential
building.
(10) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of these
regulations, when a shopping center is developed as a PUD
District, such shopping center shall have 300 square feet of
space devoted to off-street parking for each 100 square feet
of floor area in the structures located in the planned
4-56
shopping center development. Such off-street parking
facilities shall otherwise comply with the provisions of
Section 5-100A of these regulations.
(11) The specifications for the width and surfacing of streets,
alleys, ways for public utilities, for curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, public parks and playgrounds, school grounds,
reserves, storm water drainage, water supply and
distribution, sanitary sewers and sewage collection and
treatment adopted in the City Subdivision Regulations as
amended from time to time, may, within the limits hereinafter
specified, be waived or modified by the Planning Commission
where the Commission finds that such specifications are not
required in the interests of the residents or occupants of
the planned development and that the waiver or modification
of such specifications for PUD plans would not be
inconsistent with the interests of the City. The Commission
shall require guarantees for required public improvements and
the filing of comparable engineering and survey data on final
development plans.
(12) Any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that
would otherwise be applicable to the site shall be warranted
by the design of the PUD plan, and the amenities incorporated
in it, and shall not be inconsistent with the interest of the
public generally.
2. Standards for Residential Planned Developments and General Planned
Developments Containing Residential Buildings:
a. Any PUD plan that does not propose to increase the number of
dwelling units per acre that would otherwise be permitted on the
property under the maximum zoning regulations otherwise applicable
thereto in the underlying districts which permit residences shall be
prima facie qualified for preliminary approval insofar as
residential density is concerned. A PUD plan may provide for a
greater number of dwelling units per acre than would be permitted by
these district regulations otherwise applicable to the site, but if
the number of dwelling units per acre exceeds by more than 10% of
that permitted by the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the
site, the developer has the burden to show that such excess will not
have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and
on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning
Commission, in determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase
in the number of dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that
increased density may be compensated for by additional private
amenities and by increased efficiency in public services to be
achieved by: (1) the amount, location and proposed use of common
open spaces; and (2) the location, design and type of dwelling
units. The Planning Commission shall also consider that the
physical characteristics of the site may make increased densities
appropriate in the particular location. In addition to establishing
a maximum density, the plan shall specify either the minimum number
4-57
of dwelling units and commercial or industrial uses or the minimum
acreage allowances for each specific PUD District
b. When common open space is provided in a PUD plan, the amount and
location of such common open space shall be consistent with the
declared type of development as described in Section 4-116A2 for a
PUD District. The PUD plan shall include such provisions for the
ownership and maintenance of the common open space as are reasonably
necessary to ensure its continuity, care, conservation and
maintenance, and to ensure that remedial measures will be available
to the City if the common open space is permitted to deteriorate or
is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest
of the PUD plan or of the City. If the City finds it necessary to
carry out the obligations required to maintain the open space in
order to avoid having it become a public nuisance, the costs shall
be assessed against the properties within the development and shall
become a tax lien on said properties. (See Section 2-102 for
definition of COMMON OPEN SPACE.)
c. When a PUD plan includes common open space, such common open space
shall never be used for the construction of any structure, nor shall
such open space ever be computed as a part of the required minimum
lot area, or any required yard, of any other structure. Adequate
safeguards, including recorded covenants, shall be provided to
prevent subsequent development of, and the future construction of
structures on, such open space. (See Section 2-102 for definition
of COMMON OPEN SPACE.)
d. The total ground area occupied by buildings and structures shall not
exceed 35% of the total ground area of the PUD plan unless previous
development in the neighborhood has a greater lot coverage, in which
case the PUD plan may increase the lot coverage of buildings and
structures to correspond with the bulk of the other structures in
the neighborhood.
e. Nonresidential uses of a religious, educational or recreational
nature shall be designed or intended primarily for the use of the
residents of the PUD plan.
C. Preliminary PUD Plan Contents. An application to establish a PUD District
shall be processed in the same manner prescribed for amending these Zoning
Regulations. The same requirements for notice to property owners,
advertisement of public hearing, conduct of hearing and recommendation of the
Planning Commission, protest petitions and adoption by the Governing Body
shall be required as in conventional zoning. (See Article 11.) The applicant
shall also concurrently prepare and submit a preliminary PUD plan for review
and recommendation by the Planning Commission to the Governing Body which
shall contain the following information and documents:
1. A development plan of the site showing the location, arrangement, bulk,
type and use of all existing and proposed structures, the proposed
traffic circulation pattern within and surrounding the development, the
areas to be developed for parking, the points of ingress and egress,
4-58
access streets where required, the relationship of abutting land uses and
zoning districts, proposed lots and blocks, if any, and proposed public
or common open space, if any, including reserves, parks, playgrounds,
school sites and recreational facilities.
2. Applicable information as required for a preliminary plat pursuant to
provisions in the City Subdivision Regulations.
3. A statement of the anticipated residential density (when applicable), the
proposed total gross floor area of nonresidential uses, and the
percentage of the development which is to be occupied by structures,
i.e., total area of all such zoning lots.
4. Preliminary sketches and/or description of the proposed screening and
landscaping features.
5. When a PUD plan is to be constructed in units, the phasing of development
for each unit in sequence shall be indicated. No such unit shall have a
residential density that exceeds by more than 20% the proposed
residential density of the entire PUD plan. When a PUD plan provides for
common open space, the total area of common open space provided at any
stage of development shall, at minimum, bear the same relationship to the
total open space to be provided in the entire plan as the units completed
or under development bear to the entire plan.
6. Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the parcel of
land to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the
ownership and beneficial interests in the land and the proposed
development.
7. When it deems necessary, the Planning Commission may require a traffic
survey setting out and analyzing the effect that the PUD plan will have
upon traffic in the streets and thoroughfare adjacent to and in the
vicinity of the proposed development.
8. A statement of objectives showing the relationship of the PUD plan to the
Comprehensive Plan with respect to land use for various purposes, density
of population, direction of growth, location and function of streets and
other public facilities, and common open space for recreation or visual
benefit or both, and such other factors as the City may find relevant in
making a finding whether a PUD plan shall be authorized as being in
general conformity to the Comprehensive Plan.
9. In the case of general planned developments, a statement identifying the
principal types of business and/or industrial uses that are to be
included in the proposed development.
10. When a PUD plan includes provisions for common open space, or recreational
facilities, a statement describing the provision that is to be
made for the care and maintenance of such open space or recreational
facilities. If it is proposed that such open space be owned and/or
maintained by any entity other than a governmental authority, copies of
4-59
the proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws of such entity shall be
submitted.
11. Copies of any restrictive covenants that are to be recorded with respect
to property included in the PUD plan.
D. Action on Preliminary PUD Plan.
1. Hearing, Findings and Recommendation of Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall, within 60 days after a preliminary PUD plan is filed
with it, hold a public hearing on the plan after giving the notice
required by Section 11-100D for hearings on amendments. Such public
hearing shall consider all aspects of the preliminary PUD plan including
all proposed units of development. Within 14 days after the last public
hearing on such plan, the Commission shall prepare and transmit to the
Governing Body and to the applicant specific findings of fact with
respect to the extent to which the preliminary PUD plan complies with the
standards set out in Sections 4-116B and C, together with its
recommendations to the Governing Body with respect to the action to be
taken on the PUD plan. The Commission may recommend approval,
disapproval or approval with modifications, conditions or restrictions.
Copies of the findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission
shall be made available to any other interested persons.
2. Action by the Governing Body. After a 14-day period following the public
hearing in which to receive protest petitions as provided by Section 11-
103, the Governing Body shall under the adoption procedures of Section
11-104 consider the approval or disapproval of the preliminary PUD plan
after it receives the findings and recommendations of the Planning
Commission thereon. If the preliminary PUD is disapproved, the applicant
shall be furnished with a written statement of the reasons for
disapproval of the plan. If the preliminary PUD is to be approved, the
Governing Body shall, after receiving from the applicant any acceptance
required by Section 4-116D3, adopt an ordinance establishing a PUD
District and approving the preliminary PUD plan for the parcel of land
included in the plan.
3. Restrictions and Conditions. The Governing Body may alter the
preliminary PUD plan according to the procedures of Section 11-104 and
impose such conditions and restrictions on the PUD plan as it may deem
necessary to insure that the development will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of these regulations and with the
Comprehensive Plan. When the Governing Body alters the preliminary PUD
plan, the applicant shall have 30 days within which to file an acceptance
of such alterations, conditions or restrictions.
4. Form of Ordinance. An ordinance establishing a PUD District and
approving a PUD plan shall specify the Zoning Regulations and restrictions
that will, pursuant to the PUD plan, apply in the PUD District and
shall describe the boundaries of such district or set such boundaries out
on a map that is incorporated and published as a part of such ordinance.
Such ordinance shall also specify the conditions and restrictions that
have been imposed by the Governing Body on the PUD plan, and the extent
4-60
to which the otherwise applicable district regulations have been
modified.
E. Status of Preliminary PUD Plan After Approval.
1. Within 15 days after the adoption of an ordinance establishing a PUD
District and approving a preliminary PUD plan, a copy of such ordinance
shall be filed by the City Clerk with the Zoning Administrator and a
similar copy mailed to the applicant. When approval of such a
preliminary plan has been granted, the establishment of the PUD District
by name shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
2. After being notified of the approval of a preliminary PUD plan by the
Governing Body, the applicant shall within 15 days file with the County
Register of Deeds a statement that such a plan has been filed with the
City and has been approved and is applicable to certain specified legally
described land and that copies of said plan are on file in the office of
the Zoning Administrator. Such statement recorded with the Register of
Deeds shall also specify the nature of the plan, the proposed density or
intensity of land uses and other pertinent information sufficient to
notify any prospective purchasers or users of land of the existence of
such a plan. The recorded statement shall specify that the preliminary
PUD plan shall become binding upon all successors and assigns unless
amended in conformance with these regulations.
3. Preliminary approval of a PUD plan shall not qualify such a plan for
recording. A PUD plan which has been given preliminary approval as
submitted or which has been given preliminary approval with alterations,
conditions and restrictions which have been accepted by the applicant and
provided that the applicant has not defaulted nor violated any of the
conditions of the preliminary approval, shall not be modified or revoked
nor otherwise impaired by action of the City pending an application or
applications for approval of a final PUD plan without the consent of the
applicant; provided that, an application for a final PUD plan approval is
filed within one year of the date of approval of the preliminary PUD
plan, or in the case of unit developments, that a final plan of at least
one unit shall be filed within one year from the date of approval of such
preliminary plan and final plans of all such units shall be filed within
five years from the date that such preliminary plan was approved. The
Planning Commission on application of the applicant, may from time to
time, recommend extensions of time to the Governing Body for their
decision within which an applicant may submit such final PUD plans. Each
such extension shall not be for more than one year.
4. In the event that a PUD plan is given preliminary approval and
thereafter, but prior to approval of a final PUD plan, the applicant
shall: (1) choose to abandon said plan and shall so notify the Planning
Commission in writing; or (2) shall fail to timely file an application,
or applications, for approval of a final plan, it shall be deemed to be
revoked. When a preliminary plan is revoked, all that portion of the
preliminary plan for which final approval has not been given shall be
subject to those provisions of the Zoning Regulations and other local
ordinances that were applicable thereto immediately prior to the approval
of the preliminary plan and as they may have been amended from time to
4-61
time. The Governing Body shall forthwith adopt an ordinance repealing
the PUD District and the preliminary PUD plan for that portion of the
development that has not received final PUD plan approval and
reestablishing the zoning and other regulatory provisions that would
otherwise be applicable. When a PUD District is revoked, such revocation
shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
F. Final PUD Plan Contents and Approval.
1. An application for approval of a final PUD plan may be filed for all the
land included in a planned development or for a unit thereof. Such
application shall be filed by the applicant with the Zoning Administrator
within the specified time in Section 4-116E3, and shall be in substantial
compliance with the preliminary PUD plan as approved. The application
shall include:
a. A development plan of the site showing the physical layout and design
of all streets, easements, rights of way, reserves, lots, blocks and
common open space including statements, where applicable, on the
residential densities, the types and uses of structures, the maximum
gross floor area, the percentage of the development by total area of
such zoning lots to be occupied by structures, the height of
structures, the height and size of signs, the building setback lines,
and the boundary of units within which the phasing of construction
would be scheduled.
b. Applicable information and certificates as required for a final plat
pursuant to the provisions in the City Subdivision Regulations
including such waivers and modifications as may have been agreed to
in the preliminary PUD plan.
c. Plans for landscaping and screening.
d. All certifications of approval required by the City Subdivision
Regulations for a final plat with the modification that the words
final PUD plan and plat shall be utilized wherever the word plat
appears in the wording.
e. Proof of the establishment and activation of any entity that is to be
responsible for the management and maintenance of any common open
space and copy of any restrictive covenants.
f. No lots, parcel or dwelling unit in such development shall be
conveyed or leased prior to the recording of the final PUD plan.
g. Such guarantees and agreements that are required by the provisions
and procedures of the City Subdivision Regulations regarding final
plats.
2. A PUD plan submitted for final approval shall be deemed to be in
substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan, as approved;
provided that, any modification by the developer of the preliminary
plan, as approved, does not: (1) vary the proposed gross residential
4-62
density or intensity of use by more than 5%; or (2) involve a
reduction of the area set aside for common open space; nor (3) increase
by more than 10% the gross floor area proposed for nonresidential use;
nor (4) increase by more than 5% the total area of zoning lots used for
buildings or a substantial change in their height. A public hearing
shall not be held to consider modifications in the location and design
of streets or facilities for water and for disposal of sanitary sewerage
and storm water.
3. Although a public hearing shall not be required on an application for
approval of a final PUD plan to determine if it is in substantial
compliance with the preliminary PUD plan, as approved, the Planning
Commission may receive public input related to the final plan if deemed
desirable. The burden shall be upon the applicant to show the Planning
Commission good cause for any variation between the preliminary plan, as
approved, and the final plan as submitted. When the application for
final approval has been filed, together with all drawings,
specifications and other documents required in support thereof, the
Commission shall make a recommendation on such final plan; provided,
however, that in the event the final plan as submitted contains
variations from the preliminary plan as approved, but remains in
substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the
Commission may, after a meeting with the applicant, refuse to recommend
approval of the final plan and shall so advise the applicant in writing
of such refusal, setting out the reasons why one or more of said
variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such
refusal, the applicant may refile his application for final approval
without the variations objected to by the Commission at any time within
which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval. If the time for
applying for final approval shall have expired at the time when the
Commission advised the applicant that the variations were not in the
public interest, then the applicant shall have 60 additional days within
which to refile an application for final approval without the said
variation. If the applicant shall fail to refile within said period, he
or she shall be deemed to have refused to accept such requirements and
final approval shall be deemed to have not been approved.
4. In the event the final PUD plan, as submitted for approval, is not in
substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan as approved, the
Planning Commission shall so notify the applicant in writing, setting
out the particular ways in which the final plan is not in substantial
compliance with the preliminary plan as approved. The applicant may
make such changes in the final plan as are necessary to bring it into
compliance with the preliminary plan as provided for variations in
Section 4-116F3, or may file an application for an amended PUD District
and/or a preliminary PUD plan in order to bring the proposed final plan
into substantial compliance with such an amended District or plan. The
time limit within which to file such amendments shall be the same as for
a variation in Section 1167F3. Notice thereof shall be given and the
public hearing shall be held and conducted in the manner prescribed in
Sections 4-116 D and E of these regulations including the provisions for
protest petitions, Governing Body approval and filing a revised
statement of the plan with the County Register of Deeds. In the event
the applicant shall fail to take either of these alternate actions
4-63
within said time, the applicant shall be deemed to have abandoned the
plan.
5. After a final PUD plan, or any unit thereof, has been submitted for
consideration by either the procedures prescribed in Sections 4-116F 3
or 4, the plan shall be considered for final approval by the Governing
Body within 30 days. A final PUD plan, or any part thereof, which has
been given final approval by the Governing Body, shall be filed of
record with the County Register of Deeds within 60 days following the
satisfying of all conditions precedent and conditioned upon such
approval as well as signatures for all certificates required for a final
plat before recording. A copy of the recorded final plan shall also be
filed with the Zoning Administrator before any building and/or zoning
permits are issued or development takes place in accordance therewith.
In the event the Governing Body fails to act, either by approval or by
disapproval within the time prescribed, the final plan shall be deemed
to be approved. Pending completion within a reasonable time of said PUD
plan, or of any unit thereof, that has been finally approved, no
modification of the provisions of said plan, or unit thereof, as finally
approved, shall be made except with the consent of the applicant.
6. In the event that a final PUD plan or unit thereof is given final
approval and thereafter the applicant shall abandon said plan or the
unit thereof and shall so notify the City in writing, or in the event
the applicant shall fail to commence the plan within 18 months after
final approval, it shall terminate and shall be deemed null and void
unless such time period is extended by the Governing Body upon written
application by the applicant.
G. Enforcement and Modification. To further the mutual interest of the residents
and owners of the final PUD plan and of the public in the preservation of the
integrity of the plan, as finally approved and to insure that modifications,
if any, in the plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the residents
and owners upon the provisions of the plan, nor result in changes that would
adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the
provisions of the plan as finally approved, whether recorded by plan,
covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following provisions:
1. Enforcement by the City. The provisions of the final plan relating to:
a. The use of land and the use, bulk (height, yards and maximum
coverage) and location of buildings and structures;
b. The quality and location of common open space; and
c. The intensity of use or the density of residential units shall
run in favor of the City and shall be enforceable in law or in
equity by the City without limitation on any powers or
regulation otherwise granted the City by law.
2. Enforcement by the residents and owners. All provisions of the final
PUD plan shall run in favor of the residents and owners of the planned
development, but only to the extent expressly provided in the plan and
in accordance with the terms of the plan and to that extent such
4-64
provisions, whether recorded by plan, covenant, easement or otherwise,
may be enforced at law or equity by residents and owners, acting
individually, jointly, or through an organization designated in the plan
to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no provisions of the
plan shall be implied to exist in favor of residents and owners of the
development except as to those portions of the plan which have been
finally approved and have been recorded.
3. Modification of the final PUD plan by the City. All those provisions of
the plan authorized to be enforced by the City under Section 4-116G1 may
be modified, removed or released by the City (except grants or easements
relating to the service or equipment of a public utility unless
expressly consented to by the public utility), subject to the following
conditions:
a. No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of
the plan by the City shall affect the rights of the residents
and owners of the planned development to maintain and enforce
those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in Section
4-116G2.
b. No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the
plan by the City shall be permitted as an amendment except upon
notice and a public hearing by Sections 11-100D, E and F,
recommendation of the Planning Commission, 14-day protest
petition period and adoption by the Governing Body. An
additional finding must be made that (1) the amendment is
consistent with the efficient development and preservation of
the entire final PUD plan; (2) does not adversely affect
either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across a street
from the plan or the public interest; and (3) is not granted
solely to confer a special benefit upon any person. Such
amendments may serve the purpose achieved by otherwise
processing a vacation, variance or a conditional use as an
exception.
4. Modification by the residents and owners. Residents and owners of the
planned development may, to the extent and in the manner expressly
authorized by the provision of the final PUD plan, modify, remove or
release their rights to enforce the provisions of the plan, but no such
action shall affect the right of the City to enforce the provisions of
the plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-116G1. If it is
determined by the Zoning Administrator that such modifications would
result in changes to the PUD District and/or the preliminary PUD plan,
then application must be made for such amendment or amendments to be
considered for reapproval of the district or plan in the same manner as
the original. If it is determined that modifications resulting in
changes to the final PUD plan are necessary and cannot be satisfied
under Sections 4-116F 2, 3, 4 and 5, then application must be made for
such amendment or amendments to the original PUD District and/or
preliminary PUD plan as may be necessary to consider such amendment(s).

117 P-O, Protective Overlay District
This district may be applied as an overlay district in combination with any
underlying zoning district except the PUD Planned Unit Development district.
By limiting specific uses or requiring more restrictive development standards
to individual projects or specific properties, this district is intended to:
1) ensure compatibility among incompatible or potentially incompatible
land uses;
2) ease the transition from one zoning district to another;
3) address sites or land uses with special requirements; and
4) guide development in unusual situations or unique circumstances.
Development standards include, but are not limited to, lot sizes, bulk
requirements, use limitations, off-street parking and loading provisions,
accessory structures and uses, sign standards, miscellaneous requirements of
Section 3-103 and screening and landscape requirements of Section 3-104.
A. Use and Development Standards. This district can be used to modify and
restrict the use and development standards of an underlying zoning
district. All requirements of this district are in addition to and
supplement all other applicable standards and requirements of these
regulations. Restrictions and conditions imposed by this district shall
be limited to the following:
1. Prohibiting otherwise permitted or special or conditional uses and
accessory uses; or making an otherwise permitted use a special or
conditional use;
2. Decreasing the number or average density of dwelling units that may
be constructed on the site;
3. Increasing minimum lot size or lot width;
4. Increasing minimum setback requirements in any yard;
5. Restrictions on access to abutting properties and streets, including
specific design features; and
4-66
6. Any other development standards required or authorized by these
regulations.
B. Method of adoption. Modifications and restrictions imposed through this
district are considered part of this zoning text and accompanying map.
All property included in the district shall be identified on the Official
Zoning Maps by adding the letters P-O and a number to the base zoning
district symbol. The number shall be assigned when the application is
filed and numbers shall run consecutively beginning with the number 1.
The effectuating ordinance for zoning or rezoning property to the P-O
district shall specifically state the modifications or restrictions
imposed pursuant to Sec. 4-118A. Such modifications and restrictions
imposed shall be considered part of the text of these regulations, and a
violation of them shall be a violation of these regulations. The
modifications and restrictions shall continue in full force and effect
until revised in accordance with the same amendment procedures as for the
approval of the original P-O District.
C. Effect of P-O Designation. When the P-O District zoning designation is
applied in combination with an underlying zoning district, it shall
always be considered to result in a more restrictive designation than if
the base district did not have the P-O classification. In the event that
the P-O designation was not originally requested as part of the rezoning
application, but is added instead during the public hearing process,
renotification and re-advertisement of the requested zoning change shall
not be required.
5-1
ARTICLE 5. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
100 Off-Street Parking. In any applicable zoning district, all structures built
and all uses established hereafter shall provide accessory off-street parking
in accordance with the following regulations. When an existing structure or
use is expanded, accessory off-street parking shall be provided in accordance
with the following regulations for the area or capacity of such expansion.
Plans showing the layout and design of all off-street parking spaces and
loading areas must be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator before
a zoning permit is issued for such spaces or areas.
A. General Provisions.
1. Utilization: Accessory off-street parking facilities provided for the
uses hereinafter listed shall be solely for the parking of motor
vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants or employees of
such uses. Such parking facilities or any vacant lot shall not be
used to display or store motor vehicles including recreational
vehicles and utility trailers for sale other than where permitted
specifically in a district. Such provision shall not prevent the
display of a small temporary "for sale" sign not exceeding two square
feet in size on a personal vehicle when parked periodically on a
driveway or an identifiable parking area on a zoning lot of a
residence or a business location. (See Section 2-102 for definition
of OUTDOOR STORAGE.)
2. Parking space dimension: An off-street parking space shall be at
least eight feet six inches in width and at least 19 feet in length,
exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps or columns, unless special
parking is designated for variable sizes of vehicles.
3. Access: Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an
aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. No parking
space shall be designed to exit or back directly onto a public street
or use the public right-of-way for parking space, unless specifically
approved by the Governing Body. Such arrangements are to be
discouraged, except in unusual circumstances wherein the traffic
safety of the public can still be protected.
4. Open and enclosed parking: Off-street parking spaces open to the sky
may be located in any yard, except that in residential districts no
such spaces shall be located in a front yard setback other than for
multiple-family dwellings. Principal buildings with private garages,
carports and canopies integrated into or attached to the buildings
which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to
the yard setback requirements applicable in the district wherein the
buildings are located. Detached garages and carports which contain or
shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the provisions
of the accessory uses contained in Section 6-100 and, in particular,
the bulk regulations of Section 6-100C.
5-2
5. Design and Maintenance:
a. Design: Off-street parking spaces shall comply with such design
standards relating to curb cuts and curb length, stall depth,
driveway width, island width, barriers, and the location of
ingress and egress as may be established from time to time
by the City. Off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or
enclosed in a building or structure. Parking on driveways for
single and two-family dwellings and all types of manufactured and
mobile homes is considered to be permitted temporary parking and
required parking spaces on such lots are not to be in the front
yard setback. All parking spaces must be in an identifiable area
where all spaces are contained thereon. (See Sections 5-100A5b
for Surfacing and 5-100A5c for Screening.)
b. Surfacing: All open off-street parking spaces, whether required
spaces or not, and driveways shall be graded and paved with an
asphalt, asphaltic concrete, concrete or other comparable
hard-surfaced, all weather, dustless material according to
specifications of the City Engineer and shall be maintained in
good condition, provided, however, graveled parking areas are
permitted in the industrial districts. Driveways, parking spaces
and display areas for all open sales or rental lots for motor
vehicles, trailers, recreational vehicles and manufactured and
mobile homes shall be paved or graveled.
c. Screening: Screening for parking spaces and loading areas is
incorporated into the general screening and landscaping provisions
of Section 3-104.
d. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
spaces shall be shaded so that direct light is not cast upon
property located in a residential district and so that glare is
not a problem to traffic on any public street.
e. Repair and service: No motor vehicle repair work or service of
any kind shall be permitted in association with any off-street
parking spaces or structures, except as incidental repairs to a
personal vehicle. (See Section 2-102 for SALVAGE YARD.)
f. Computation: When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by these regulations results in a
requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or
less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half
shall be counted as one parking space.
g. Collective provisions: Off-street parking facilities for separate
uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so
furnished is not less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each such use; provided, that wherever there is a common plan
of parking for land in single ownership that the amount of
required parking shall consider the joint use of such space
whenever large places of assembly are present which vary in their
5-3
times of use and season of the year to the end that all parking is
contained on the site or on accessory parking lots except for
infrequent periods of peak use. The off-street parking spaces
required by Section 5-101 may be increased; however, where it is
anticipated that peak parking periods will be a consistently
reoccurring problem. All regulations must be adhered to which
cover the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the
use served.
h. Location: All parking spaces required to serve structures or uses
shall be located on the same zoning lot as the structure or use
served unless a conditional use permit is obtained under Section
5-102 for off-premises parking areas. Existing shared garages may
continue as legal, conforming structures and, notwithstanding the
provisions in these regulations for a required side yard setback,
may be replaced in a similar location by mutual agreement of the
adjacent owners.
i. Employee parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis
shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or
residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
j. Handicapped parking: Parking spaces according to the number of
spaces and their designated signage shall be provided for persons
with a disability in conformance to the standards of the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as incorporated into state
statutes. (See K.S.A. 58-1311 and 42 USCA 12101 et seq.)
6. Plans and approval required: Plans showing the layout and design of
all off-street parking spaces whether required spaces or not,
including driveways and loading areas, shall be submitted to and
approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a zoning
permit for the parking layout itself or as part of an application for
a larger related project. Before approving any parking layout, the
Administrator shall determine that the spaces provided are usable and
meet City design standards as well as all parking requirements of
these regulations. Parking spaces shall be clearly indicated or
otherwise marked to designate the individual spaces. (See Section 5-
100A 1-5 for design standards.)
101 Required Parking Spaces. Off-street parking spaces accessory to the uses
hereinafter designated shall be provided as follows, except no such spaces
shall be required in the B-3 Central Business District unless for multiplefamily

or when issuing the zoning permit.
5-6
102 Conditional Use for Parking. In order to provide off-premises required or
additional off-street parking areas nearby, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
grant a conditional use for the establishment of such parking areas in any
zoning district under the following provisions: (See Section 2-102 for
PREMISES.)
A. Location. The nearest access to the parking area provided under this
section must be within 300 feet (along lines of public access) from the
boundary of the nearest entrance to the structure for which the parking is
provided.
B. Use. The parking area shall be used for passenger vehicles only, and in
no case shall it be used for sales, repair work, storage, dismantling or
servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. Only such
signs as are necessary for the proper operation of the parking lot shall
be permitted.
C. Improvements.
1. Parking spaces and driveways on private property providing ingress and
egress to parking areas shall be surfaced with concrete, asphaltic
concrete, asphalt or any other comparable surfacing which meets the
approval of the Board and shall be maintained in good condition and
free of weeds, dust, trash and other debris.
2. Parking areas shall have adequate guards to prevent extension or the
overhanging of vehicles beyond property lines or parking spaces. Such
areas shall have adequate markings for channelization and movement of
vehicles.
3. If lighting facilities are provided, they shall be so arranged as to
deflect or direct light away from any adjacent dwelling or residential
district.
4. A fence (such as solid-wall masonry, wood, louvered/wood, metal or
other similar materials) not less than six feet high, may be required
to be erected along any property line adjacent to or adjoining any
residential district to reduce noise, eliminate the passage of light
from vehicles and prevent the blowing of debris. Whenever a fence
shall be required along a front yard which includes a driveway area,
such fence shall not be higher than four feet.
5. When located in a residential district, parking shall not be located
within a front yard and the front yard shall remain unpaved and shall
be landscaped unless a waiver by the Board is warranted due to the
nature and arrangement of the adjacent land use.
6. The Board shall determine the necessity of additional improvements in
order to protect adjacent property owners and the public interest.
Such improvements shall include, but not be limited to proper
drainage, setbacks, screening, grass, shrubs, trees and the

streets and alleys.
5-7
103 Off-Street Loading and Unloading. In all zoning districts except the B-3
Central Business District, loading and unloading space shall be provided
off-street and on the same premises with every building, structure or part
thereof, hereafter erected, established, or enlarged and occupied which
requires the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by motor
vehicle. The loading and unloading space shall be so located as to avoid undue
interference with public use of streets, alleys and walkways. Such vehicular
access shall be maintained in good condition and surfaced in such manner as
required in Section 5-100A5b for parking spaces. When off-street parking space
is used to fulfill this loading and unloading requirement, the latter shall be
scheduled so as not to interfere with meeting the parking needs.
5-8
(Intentionally left blank)
6-1
ARTICLE 6. ACCESSORY USES, TEMPORARY USES AND HOME OCCUPATIONS
100 Accessory Uses Authorization. Accessory uses are permitted in any zoning
district in connection with any principal use which is permitted.
A. Definitions. An accessory use is a structure or use which:
1. Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or use;
2. Is subordinate in area, extent or purpose to the principal building or
use served; however, this does not preclude recreational areas for
tennis, swimming, racquetball, basketball and similar activities;
3. Contributes to the comfort, recreation, convenience or necessity of
occupants, business or industry in the principal building or use
served; and
4. Is located on the same zoning lot as the principal building or use
served. (See Section 6-100D1 regarding beginning any accessory
structure or use prior to the principal building or use.)
B. Permitted Accessory Uses. Any structure or use that complies with the
terms of Section 6-100A may be allowed as an accessory use or structure
and may be included, but is not limited to the following list of
examples:*
1. Off-street parking and loading space as regulated by Article 5 of
these regulations, including detached garages and carports. On lots
for single and two-family dwelling units and all types of manufactured
and mobile homes, such structures may contain incidental space for
storage and other uses and are limited to one each per zoning lot not
over 720 square feet in gross floor area for a garage and 400 square
feet for a carport, unless a conditional use is approved by the Board
of Zoning Appeals for a larger structure.
2. Signs, when permitted by Article 7 of these regulations.
3. Buildings for storage and other enclosed purposes; provided, that no
such building accessory to single and two-family dwelling units and
all types of manufactured and mobile homes shall exceed 400 square
feet in gross floor area, unless a conditional use is approved by the
Board of Zoning appeals for a larger building. No motorized vehicle
of any type or any portion thereof such as a truck trailer may be used
on a residential lot for storage or any purpose other than for
periodic vehicular parking according to provisions of Article 5.
Similarly, a railroad box car, construction trailer, dumpster,
shipping container or portable storage unit is not permitted for a
period exceeding 30-days on a residential lot. (NOTE: One extension,
not to exceed 30-days, may be granted by the Zoning Administrator upon
written proof of extenuating circumstances.) Motorized vehicles and
portions thereof, construction trailers, dumpsters, shipping
containers or portable storage units; however, may be used only
temporarily for refuse disposal or storage during a period of
construction, reconstruction or moving including location on a
6-2
driveway. (See Section 2-102 for definition of PORTABLE STORAGE
UNIT.)
4. Metal accessory buildings over 100 square feet in size shall
be prohibited in all residential zoning districts unless approved
as a Conditional Use by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any such approval
shall be appropriately conditioned to ensure that the metal building be
visually compatible with the principal dwelling unit and surrounding
residential neighborhood. Such conditions may include the requirement
for roofing and/or siding materials and color choices customarily used
on site-built structures.
5. Storage of recreational vehicles,(RV's); provided, such parking or
storage does not create a traffic hazard or adversely affect the
public health, safety, or aesthetics, that they shall not be used for
living purposes except for the convenience of temporary lodging only
for not more than 15 days at any one time, and when stored on a
residential lot by the occupant who is the vehicle owner, shall not be
located in any front yard and not less than five feet from any side
lot line nor five feet from any rear lot line and in accordance with
the following exceptions and requirements. (See Section 2-102 for
definition of RECREATIONAL VEHICLE, (RV))
a. If the physical layout of the lot along with the observance of the
above criteria would result in a side and/or rear yard unusable
for RV storage, and the RV in question was stored on the owner's
property at the effective date of these regulations, and the RV
was purchased prior to the effective date of these regulations,
the RV owner may apply to the Zoning Administrator for a legal,
nonconforming use certificate. The possession of a legal
nonconforming use certificate will act to "grandfather" the
existing storage location for the present owner, however, the RV
must be located a minimum of 5 feet back from the property line.
The RV owner must apply for a certificate on or before December
31, 1995 in order to be considered eligible for such a
certificate.
b. If the foregoing process does not result in an acceptable RV
storage location as determined by the Zoning Administrator, the
owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional
use.
c. Current owners will have until December 31, 1995 to achieve
compliance. The current owners' legal, non-conforming use
certificate, or conditional use may not be transferred to
subsequent owners.
Zoning permits are required only for accessory structures which exceed 100 square feet of ground
area; however, permits are required for fences in the front yard setback (For other accessory
zoning permits, see Section 6-101 for temporary uses, Section 6-102 for home occupations,
Section 5-100 for parking spaces and loading areas and Article 7 for signs.)
6-3
d. A recreational vehicle may be parked on the adjacent public street
for the purposes of servicing, loading and unloading, but not for
a period exceeding 48 hours. (See City Traffic Code.)

district which would permit a broader range of home occupations
and less restrictions than otherwise required, so long as in the opinion
of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas
is minimized to the extent feasible and the public interest served. The
intent of such a provision is to provide for a wider range of home
occupational activities while at the same time protecting adjacent
properties from the intrusion of incompatible uses and uses of too great
an intensity. In addition to the procedures and standards for
establishing conditional uses as provided for in Section 10-108, the Board
may, using the use limitation restrictions of Section 6-102B as

102 General Standards.
A. Gross Surface Area of Sign. The entire area within a single continuous
perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of such sign, and in no case
passing through or between any adjacent elements of same. Such perimeter
shall not include any structural elements lying outside the limits of such
sign and which do not form an integral part of the display. When two or
more signs are located on a zoning lot, the gross surface area of all
signs on the lot shall not exceed the maximum gross surface per street
frontage set by the applicable district regulations, except as is provided
by Section 7-102B. For signs on interior lots which might be viewed from
both sides, the area shall be calculated only for the larger of the two
sides.

interfere with the view of, or be confused with; any traffic control
sign, signal or device; or where it may interfere with, mislead or
confuse traffic.
2. No sign shall be located in any vision triangle as defined in Section
2-102, except official traffic signs and signs mounted eight feet or
more above the ground whose supports, not exceeding two, do not exceed

obstruction.
K. Location. No sign or structure thereof shall be permitted on a public
right-of-way or public easement, except temporary off-site real estate and
garage sale signs may be placed on the public right-of-way with the
approval of the adjacent land owner to provide direction to the property
during a showing or sale provided such signs do not obstruct traffic
visibility. Such signs may only be displayed during an open house or a
7-4
garage sale and must be removed at the conclusion of such open house or
sale. No sign shall be permitted to project over a public right-of-way or
public easement, except with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals
as a conditional use, or as a permitted use in the B-3 Central Business
District when the lowest part of such sign is at least seven feet above

Nonmetal signs, Section 7-102L2 for portable signs, Section 7-103A5 for
garage sale signs and Section 7-103B5 for real estate signs.)
L. Portable Signs. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations
and, in particular, Article 7, the following provisions apply to the use

the premises, such as A-frames, trailer signs, signs placed on
vehicles, beacon lights and other similar signs. Any such sign shall
not exceed a height of 10 feet above grade level nor 60 square feet in
gross surface area.
2. All the general standards of Sections 7-102A through K are applicable
to portable signs, except that in Section 7-102K such signs may
project over or be located on public easements, but not the public
street right-of-way.
3. Whereas portable signs are not required to set back any minimum
distance from lot lines in any zoning district, the Zoning Administrator
shall, in his discretion, strictly enforce the traffic safety
provisions of Section 7-102J1, especially at corner intersections and
driveway entrances and exits.
4. In all zoning districts, except residential districts, portable signs
are permitted; however, any such sign shall not be located closer than
50 feet to another such sign when measured along the frontage whether
the latter is located on the same or another zoning lot, except that
each business firm shall be permitted at least one such sign
notwithstanding the 50 foot minimum spacing standard.
5. In all residential districts only portable signs are permitted which
limit their messages to the following subjects:
a. Announcements of special occasions or activities of nonprofit
organizations such as churches and fraternal and service clubs.
b. Announcements related to personal or family events such as "Happy
Birthday" and the like.
The above signs are limited to a display period of not more than 72
hours for any one announcement with the gross surface area not to
exceed 24 square feet and only one sign at a time permitted on the
premises of the party making the announcement.
6. In addition to the provisions of Sections 7-102D and E, strobe light
sources or flashing bulbs or signs which create the illusion of
movement shall not be permitted on portable signs in any district.
7-5

power source except during the hours when the business, office or
institution is open. Electrical lines shall not be permitted to lay
on the ground where vehicular traffic or pedestrian passage is allowed
and the use of extension cords for portable signs is prohibited.
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (G.F.C.I.) are required on all
electrified signs.
7. A zoning permit for each portable sign shall be obtained for each 30
day period or part thereof when the sign remains on the zoning lot.
Annual permits may be obtained for the use of such signs at one or
more locations during the year. All portable signs shall bear an
identification marker to indicate the owner's name and some system of
identifying the individual sign, e.g., by number.
8. Any unauthorized portable sign placed on public property, including
the public street right-of-way, is declared to be a public nuisance
and be the cause of its removal and impoundment without notice. If
not redeemed within 30 days by the owner paying a service charge, the
City may dispose of the sign in any manner deemed appropriate. The
Zoning Administrator may revoke the permit for any sign deemed to be
in violation of this Section, i.e., 7-102L, or of any condition on
which the permit was based and order its removal within a reasonable
period consistent with public safety.
M. Damaged or Unsafe Signs. The Zoning Administrator shall require the
immediate repair or removal of any conforming or nonconforming sign or
sign structure which has been damaged or deteriorated so as to become a
public hazard or an unsightly nuisance which may be deemed to affect
nearby property values. Such a sign or sign structure may be restored to
its original condition without obtaining a zoning permit, unless the sign
is replaced and, thus, must conform to the current regulations.
N. Signs for Non-existent Businesses. The Zoning Administrator shall require
the removal or covering of a sign advertising a business on the premises
if the business has been closed for a period of not less than 90 days.
O. Electronic Message Signs: Applications for electronic message signs shall

message signs that have a maximum brightness and/or light intensity
rating of 3,000 nits (or equivalent) or less.
No electronic message sign shall be erected or installed without dimming
controls to ensure the sign is appropriately dimmed at night. Acceptable
dimming controls include automated light sensing devices (photocells)
7-6
and/or programmable controls that are set by the user to automatically dim
the sign at night. Generally, the maximum nighttime brightness and/or
light intensity shall not exceed 3,000 nits (or equivalent.) For
electronic message signs that have a maximum brightness and/or light
intensity of 3,000 nits (or equivalent) or less, dimming controls shall
not be required.

ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
100 Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to (1) provide for the regulation of
nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses; and (2) specify those
circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be
permitted to continue. The right to continue a nonconforming lot, building,
structure or use shall not be affected by a change in ownership or operator of
the structure or use unless such ownership or operator is a condition attached
to an approval for a special or conditional use. A definition of such
nonconformities are as follow:
A. Nonconforming Lot of Record. A zoning lot which is shown by a recorded
plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining
tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width
at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations
and such lot now neither complies with the lot area requirements or the
width for any permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is
located.
B. Nonconforming Structure. An existing building or structure which does not
comply with the maximum lot coverage and height or the minimum yard
requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district
in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Use. An existing use of a structure or land which does not
comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning
district in which it is located.
101 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
A. In Any Residential District.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of
these regulations, a single-family detached dwelling or any type of
manufactured home which is a permitted use and complies with the
restrictions in Section 8-101A2 may be located on a lot or lots in the
same ownership within the City that is not less than 50 feet in width
and that consists entirely of a tract of land that:
a. Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or depth, or
all three; and
b. Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately
and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the
creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would
not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101A1 shall comply with all of the
regulations except lot area, width and depth applicable to
single-family detached dwellings or any type of manufactured home in
the zoning district in which the lot in question is located;
provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall
apply in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
8-2
a. The structure shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard
on each side of the dwelling.
b. The sum of the widths of the two side yards on each lot shall be
not less than the smaller of:
(1) 20% of the width of the lot, or
(2) the minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk
regulations for the zoning district.
c. In any case, neither side yard resulting from the methods
permitted in Section 8-101A2b shall be less than five feet wide.
d. When a yard is also considered to be a front yard on a corner lot,
one of the front yards comprising part of the lot width may be
reduced to 15 feet, however, in the case of the entrance side of a
garage, the setback shall not be less than 18 feet.
B. In Districts Other than Residential Districts.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of
these regulations, a structure designed for any permitted use within
the City may be erected on a lot of the type described in Section
8-101A1.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101B1 shall comply with all of the
regulations except minimum lot area, width and depth applicable in the
zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided,
that the width of any side yard must not be less than that derived by
applying the following formula (wherein the width of any side yard
required = w):
Minimum side yard required
Actual lot width X by district regulations
w =
Minimum lot width required by district regulations
102 Nonconforming Structures.
A. Authority to Continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is
located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size
requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued, so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in
Section 8-102B through 8-102D.
B. Enlargement, Repair or Alterations. Any such structure described in
Section 8-102A may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally
altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair
or alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase
8-3
the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure,
except that as to structures located on a lot that does not comply with
the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements shall be
determined by Section 8-101A2 or 8-101B2, whichever is applicable.
C. Damage. In the event that any structure described in Section 8-102A is
damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of
its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in
which it is located; provided, that structures located on a lot that does
not comply with the applicable lot size requirements shall not in any
event be required to provide a side yard that exceeds the yard
requirements in Sections 8-101A2 or B2, whichever is applicable. When a
structure is damaged to the extent of 50% or less of its fair market
value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is
obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date
of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. If
the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in
approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on
data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming
Nonresidential Structures and Uses and Page A-44 for Substantial
Improvement in the Floodplain Regulations.)
D. Moving. No structure described in Section 8-102A shall be moved in whole
or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or
any other lot, unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being
moved. (See Section 3-103M for Moving Structures and City code.)
103 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Authority to Continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or
all of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land, not
involving a structure or only involving a structure which is accessory to
such use of land, may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject
to the regulations contained in Sections 8-103B through 8-103J.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, installation
or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that
this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of
Sections 8-103C through I of these regulations.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in
accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with
protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be
unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided that
such restoration will not be in violation of Section 8-103F of these
regulations.
8-4
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part
to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the entire
structure and use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Extension.
1. Extension of a nonconforming use is permitted within a nonconforming
structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or
on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a
subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become
nonconforming; provided, however, that no structural alterations shall
be made unless such changes, and the use thereof, conform to the
regulations of the district in which the structure is located.
2. Extension of a nonconforming use of a part of a structure is not
permitted if all or substantially all of the structure is designed or
intended for a use which is permitted in the district in which the
structure is located, nor shall the use be changed to any other
nonconforming use.
3. Extension of a nonconforming use is not permitted to any structure or
land area other than the one actually occupied or used by such
nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the
effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent
amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming.
E. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
F. Damage. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in
part to a nonconforming use is damaged, by any means except flooding, to
the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall
not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
When such damage is 50% or less of the fair market value, no repairs or
restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained, and
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such
partial damage and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant
is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the
percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by
the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming Nonresidential
Structures and Uses and A-44 for Substantial Improvement in the Floodplain
Regulations.)
8-5
G. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance
whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so
moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part
for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other
lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See Section
3-103M for Moving Structures and City code.)
H. Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made other than those
necessary to repair or maintain the structure as described in Section
8-103B1, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a similar type of use or more restrictive
use. Similarly, a nonconforming use of land not involving a
structure or involving only an accessory structure may also be changed.
When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive use or to
any permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a less
restrictive use or to a nonconforming use. In determining whether a
change in use is the same, similar or more restrictive, the Zoning
Administrator shall consider the changes in environmental factors such as
outdoor storage, loading, traffic, parking, noise, lighting, air
pollution, hours of operation, screening and other factors, as well as the
provisions available in Section 8-105. (See Section 9-101A for Zoning
Permits and Section 9-101B for Occupancy Certificates.)
I. Abandonment.
1. When a nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure, or
involving only a structure which is accessory to the nonconforming use
of land, is abandoned for a period of six consecutive months
regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon or to resume
such use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed,
and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall comply with the
regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.
2. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was
designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning
district in which such structure is located is abandoned for a period
of 12 consecutive months regardless of any reservation of an intent
not to abandon or to resume such use, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such
structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in
which such structure is located.
3. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was not
designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning
district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period
of 12 consecutive months regardless of any reservation of an intent
not to abandon or to resume such use, such use shall not thereafter be
reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such
8-6
structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in
which such structure is located.
J. Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal
nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or
terminate.
104 Nonconforming Residential Structures. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
8-103C, D and E, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and
which is located in a business or industrial district, may be structurally
altered, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided, that after any such
alteration, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be
used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such
structure accommodated prior to any such work unless specifically permitted by
the district.
105 Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Sections 8-102 B and C and
8-103C, D, E and F, nonconforming nonresidential structures and uses that
existed on the day prior to the effective date of these regulations, may apply
on a one time basis only to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use
to structurally alter, enlarge or reconstruct after damage, or make extensions
to structures or uses including the use of additional land when properly zoned
for the use, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions
that the effect upon adjacent areas is protected to the extent feasible and the
public interest served. (See Section 10-107C6 for Authorized Variances.)
106 Status of Existing Special and Conditional Uses.
A. The following procedures are to be followed to determine the status of
existing special and conditional uses after their reclassification as
lawful, permitted, special or conditional uses in these regulations to
avoid nonconformities and to provide equitable conversions of such uses:
1. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations
and any prior regulations was previously permitted only as a special
use, i.e., an exemption, in that particular district as approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals, such uses shall not be deemed to be
nonconforming, but shall, without further action, be deemed to be a
lawful special use or conditional use as now classified with the same
conditions applicable as originally established unless reclassified
now as a permitted use.
2. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations
and any prior regulations and was or is now classified as a special
use or an exemption, i.e., a conditional use, it shall be considered
to be a lawful conforming special or conditional use. Additions or
alterations to existing structures or land improvements for expansion
of such lawful uses may be made within the area of the lot included in
the ownership existing at the time of adoption of these regulations,
and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these
regulations as a permitted use.
8-7
3. Whenever land has been previously zoned by McPherson County as a
special or conditional use, it shall be considered to be a lawful,
conforming special or conditional use in any district; provided that
the same conditions attached to its approval as a special or
conditional use under the County Zoning Regulations remain in effect
and enforceable by the City, unless now classified as a permitted use
or an application is made to change the zoning status.

loading space and signs, see Articles 5, 6 and 7. Such permits shall
not be issued by any other official, employee, department, board or
agency of the City, except as provided for as a temporary permit in
Section 6-101. Any zoning permit issued in conflict with the
provisions of these regulations shall be null and void.
2. Except for a continuation of an existing use or occupancy, accessory
structures or uses, or additions to existing structures or uses,
permits must also meet the requirements of the City Subdivision
Regulations and, thus, shall not be issued on land which is not shown
on a recorded plat or replat, or a lot split or exempted from the
platting requirements. If platting is not required, all of the public
improvements necessary to carry out the requested permit nevertheless
may be required, including dedications in lieu of platting for
easements and to widen rights-of-way.
* The City may issue zoning permits and occupancy certificates concurrently with
the process of issuing building and occupancy permits under City building codes.
9-3
3. No principal or accessory building or structure or use shall be
permitted to locate on or project over any platted or recorded public
easement or over any known utility installation, unless (1) as a sign
permitted by Section 7-102K or (2) as an accessory structure or use
which is moveable, relocatable or poses no significant problem to the
maintenance of existing public improvement installations or to such
future installations. Ground level extensions such as concrete slabs
or other permanent-type materials are not permitted in or on a public
easement except as extensions of parking spaces, driveways or
sidewalks for which a zoning permit has been or is being issued. In
any event, when such structures or uses are permitted to be located on
or project over such easements, the property owner assumes the risk
and liability for any reconstruction or replacement necessary
including fences if any maintenance or other improvements are required
by a governmental agency or a utility provider.
4. A zoning permit is not initially required for grading and/or excavating
a proposed construction site, unless the site is located in the
1% chance Floodplain and would result in an increase in flood levels.
Prior to issuing a zoning permit such grading or excavation does not
allow excavation for building construction, i.e., basements, footings,
foundation walls, etc. (See Pages A-25 to A-45 for Floodplain
Regulations.)
5. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be
accompanied by the following:
a. A drawing or copy of the recorded plat, of the piece or parcel of
land, lot(s), block(s), parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale
showing the actual dimensions of the zoning lot(s), including any
easements thereon.
b. A drawing, drawn to scale and in such form as may, from time to
time, be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, showing the
location, ground area, height and bulk of (1) all present and
proposed structures, (2) drives, parking spaces and loading areas,
(3) building setback lines in relation to lot lines, (4) waste
disposal areas, (5) use to be made of such present and proposed
structures on the land, and (6) such other information as may be
required for the proper enforcement of these regulations.
One copy of such drawings shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator
as a public record.
6. Issuance. A zoning permit shall be either issued or disapproved by
the Zoning Administrator within 10 days after the receipt of an
application thereof or within such further period as may be agreed to
by the applicant. When the Zoning Administrator refuses to issue a
zoning permit, he shall advise the applicant in writing of the reasons
for the disapproval.
7. Period of Validity. A zoning permit shall become null and void 180
days after the date on which it is issued, unless within said period
construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of a
structure is commenced or a use is commenced. If the construction or
work is abandoned or suspended for any 180-day period after such a
permit is issued, then application must be made to the Zoning
9-4
Administrator for an extension of time to continue the project. The
Zoning Administrator may grant reasonable extensions of time provided
no changes have been made in any applicable regulations. If such
changes have occurred, application must be made for a new permit based
on the provisions of the new or amended regulations in order to
continue the project, unless Section 2-100G applies pertaining to
vesting of single-family residential developments. (See Section
2-100F for Effect of Existing Permits.)
B. Occupancy Certificates. No structure or addition thereto constructed,
reconstructed, moved or altered after the effective date of these regulations
shall be occupied or used for any purpose; and no land vacant on
the effective date of these regulations shall be used for any purpose; and
no use of any land or structure shall be changed to any other use, unless
an occupancy certificate shall first have been obtained from the Zoning
Administrator certifying that the proposed use or occupancy complies with
all the provisions of these regulations. (See Section 8-103H for Change
in Use.)
1. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be deemed to
be an application for an occupancy certificate. Every application for
an occupancy certificate for a new or changed use of land or
structures where no zoning permit is required shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator and be in such form and contain such information
as the Administrator shall provide by general rule.
2. Issuance.
a. No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition thereto
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered or for
the new or changed use of any structure or land shall be issued
after the effective date of these regulations until such work has
been completed and the premises inspected and certified by the
Zoning Administrator to be in full and complete compliance with
the plans and specifications upon which the zoning permit was
issued including the requirements for utilities, streets and
other public improvements in the City Subdivision Regulations
which must either be installed or guaranteed. Direct access must
be available from the frontage of each zoning lot to an opened
public street or otherwise the improvement of the street must be
guaranteed by such methods as stated in the Subdivision
Regulations.
b. An occupancy certificate shall be issued or written notice shall
be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate
cannot be issued within 10 days after the receipt of an
application therefore or after the Zoning Administrator is
notified in writing that the structures or premises are ready for
occupancy or use. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy
certificate, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued to be
valid for a period not to exceed six months from its date pending
the completion of any addition or improvement(s) or during partial
occupancy of the premises; provided, satisfactory guarantees are
submitted including the possible use of performance bonds or
escrow accounts.
9-5
102 Enforcement and Liability.
A. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator or any deputies working
under his direction to enforce the provisions of these regulations in
consultation with the City Attorney in the following manner:
1. To refuse to issue any zoning permit or occupancy certificate for any
building or structure or use of any premises which would violate any
of the provisions herein.
2. To revoke a zoning permit and issue a stop order at any time for a
building or structure or use for which the same was issued when it
shall appear (1) that there is a departure from the plans, specifications
or conditions as required under terms of the permit; (2) that
the same was procured by false representation; (3) that it was issued
by mistake, or (4) that it violates any provisions of the zoning
regulations.
3. To cause any building, structure, place or premises to be inspected
and examined as required by these regulations and to order in writing
the remedying of any condition found to exist therein or threat in
violation of any provisions herein.
4. To institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such
unlawful action or use or to restrain, correct or abate such violation
on or about the premises of any building or structure which is
constructed, built, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed or
structures or land is used in violation of any provisions herein.
B. The Zoning Administrator or designee charged with the enforcement of these
regulations, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of
the duties described herein, shall not be personally liable for any
damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act or by
reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit
brought against the Administrator because of an act or omission performed
by the Administrator in the enforcement of any provision of these
regulations or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the
enforcement of these regulations shall be defended by the City until final
termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom
shall be assumed by the City. (See K.S.A. 75-6101, et seq. in general
and K.S.A. 75-6109 specifically.)
103 Violations.
A. Penalties. Pursuant to K.S.A. 12-761, as amended, any violations of these
regulations shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor. The owner or agent of a
building, structure or premises in or upon which a violation of any
provision of these regulations has been committed or shall exist or the
lessee or tenant of an entire building or entire premises in or upon which
a violation has been committed or shall exist; or the agent, architect,
building contractor or any other person who commits, takes part or assists
in any violation or who maintains any building, structure or premises in
9-6
or upon which a violation has been committed or shall exist, shall be
punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment for not more than
six months for each offense or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each
day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.
B. Remedies. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, structurally altered, converted or maintained; or any
building, structure or land is used or is proposed to be used in violation
of these regulations, the appropriate authorities of the City of
McPherson, in addition to using other remedies, may institute injunction,
mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion,
maintenance or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the
occupancy of such building, structure or land. In addition to the City,
any person, the value or use of whose property is or may be affected by
such violation, shall have the authority to maintain suits or actions in
any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce these regulations and to
abate nuisances in violation thereof.
C. Floodplain Violations. Any person, company, corporation, institution,
municipality or agency of the state who violates any provision of the
floodplain provisions of these regulations shall be subject to the
penalties and remedies as provided in Sections 9-103A and B above. Such
remedies may also be instituted by the Attorney General and the Chief
Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas State Board of
Agriculture.
104 Fees. For purposes of wholly or partially defraying the costs of the
administrative and enforcement provisions described in these regulations,
including publication costs, the applicant upon filing an application for an
amendment, special use, appeal, conditional use, variance or a zoning permit
including occupancy certificate, shall pay the Clerk a fee according to the fee
schedule approved by the Governing Body. No part of such fee shall thereafter
be refunded except for a zoning permit which is not approved.
105 Reports. The Zoning Administrator shall periodically report verbally or in
writing to the Governing Body and the Planning Commission a summary of all
zoning permits issued during the preceding period, giving details of any
permitted variations, as well as the current status of all applications in
process for amendments, special uses, appeals, conditional uses and variances.
Such a report shall include comments on any problems encountered in the
administration or enforcement of these regulations which may especially be of
use at the annual review established by Section 11-105.
10-1
ARTICLE 10. BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
100 Authorization and Membership. The existing Board of Zoning Appeals as
previously established by the Governing Body and now prescribed by K.S.A.
12-759, as amended, shall continue in office as presently constituted and
hereinafter in this Article will be referred to as the "Board." The Board
shall consist of seven members of whom six shall be residents of the City and
one shall be a resident of one or both of the extraterritorial jurisdictions
outside the City. (See Section 1-103 for Zoning Jurisdiction.) One member of
the Planning Commission shall be appointed to serve on the Board. All members
of the Board shall be appointed by the Mayor with the consent of the City
Commission. The members shall continue to serve staggered three-year terms as
presently constituted. In the event, however, that the member of the Board who
is also a member of the Planning Commission ceases to serve as a member of the
Commission, his membership on the Board shall terminate at the same time as his
membership on the Planning Commission. Vacancies upon the Board shall be
filled for the unexpired term of the member whose office has become vacant in
the same manner as is provided for the appointment of such member. The
Governing Body shall have the power to remove any member of the Board for cause
after a public hearing. All members shall serve without compensation, but may
be reimbursed for expenses when authorized by the Governing Body.
The Board shall annually elect one of its members as Chairperson and one as
Vice-Chairperson. The Board shall appoint a Secretary, who may or may not be a
member of the Board, to maintain its records and keep minutes of all
proceedings before the Board.
101 General Procedures. Public records shall be kept of all official actions of
the Board. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing evidence
presented at hearings, findings of fact, decisions and the vote of each member
upon each question. If absent, abstaining or disqualified from voting, such
fact shall be indicated. Special meetings shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine in its bylaws.
When a quorum is declared present, all actions of the Board including appeals,
variances and conditional uses as exceptions shall be made by motion and
decided by a majority vote of the members present and voting.
The Board shall establish a scale of reasonable fees to be paid in advance by
the appealing party subject to subsequent approval of such fees by the
Governing Body in the form of a fee schedule. The Board shall adopt rules for
its operation in the form of bylaws which shall include hearing procedures and
will not be in conflict with applicable State statutes and the provisions of
these regulations. Such bylaws shall be subject to the approval of the
Governing Body.
102 Jurisdiction. The Board shall have the following jurisdiction and authority as
a quasi-judicial body:
A. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination (all hereinafter referred to
collectively as "decision") made by the Zoning Administrator in the
administration and enforcement of these regulations subject to the
procedure and standards set out in Section 10-106.
10-2
B. To hear and decide on variances from specific terms of these regulations
subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-107.
C. To hear and decide on conditional uses as exceptions subject to the
procedure and standards set out in Section 10-108.
103 Notice of Hearing. For the hearing on each appeal for a decision, variance or
conditional use; public notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, name
and address of applicant, the legal description or a general description
sufficient to identify the property under consideration, and a brief
description of the subject of such hearing shall be published once in the
official newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the date of
such publication and the date for the hearing. All notices shall include a
statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection
and shall indicate where such information is available when only a general
description of the property is provided in the notice. A copy of such notice
shall be mailed to each party making the appeal and to the Secretary of the
Planning Commission.
For land inside the city limits, the Board shall also provide notice to all
owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior
boundary of the property under consideration both within the city limits and
extending outside the city limits when necessary. If the applicant's property
is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification in
addition to the 200 feet inside the City, shall be extended to 1,000 feet in
the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the
area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such notification
extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the city limits must also be
included. Such notice shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse
between the mailing date and the hearing date. A list of such owners of record
of real property with their addresses and zip codes shall be provided by the
applicant. Failure to receive such notice after it has been properly addressed
and deposited in the mail shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by
the Board. If there is no quorum present for the meeting or at the time of the
hearing, the members in attendance may agree to hold another meeting in the
future at a stated date, time and place for which, when announced at the
present meeting, no further public notice need be given.
104 Conduct of Hearing. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the
hearing on each appeal of a decision, variance or conditional use as an
exception. All hearings shall be open to the public; however, when hearing
such appeals the Board exercises quasi-judicial functions and, thus, may upon
proper motion proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A.
75-4318(a). No binding action may be taken and all voting must be conducted in
an open meeting. Any person may appear and testify at a hearing, either in
person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney. Every decision of the Board
shall be filed without unreasonable delay with the Zoning Administrator and
shall be open to public inspection during reasonable business hours.
105 Finality and Judicial Review of Decisions. Any order or determination of the
Board on an appeal for a decision, a variance or a conditional use as an
exception, shall be final decisions and shall be subject to judicial review,
but not appealable to the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Any
person, official or governmental agency, jointly or separately dissatisfied by
any decision of the Board, may present to the County District Court, a
10-3
petition, duly verified, stating that such decision is illegal in whole or in
part, specifying the grounds of the illegality and asking for relief therefrom
based on a determination of the reasonableness of any such order or
determination. Such petition shall be filed with the Court within 30 days
after the date of filing the final decision with the Zoning Administrator.
106 Appeals. An appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator with respect to
the interpretation, application or enforcement of these regulations may be
taken to the Board by any person aggrieved, or by any officer of the City, or
any governmental agency or body affected by any decision of the Zoning
Administrator.
A. Time for Appeals. Appeals shall be made within 30 days after a decision
has been made by the Zoning Administrator by filing an application for
appeal. Upon the Chairperson's receipt of an application for appeal and
notification to the Zoning Administrator, the Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Chairperson all of the papers constituting the
record upon which the decision being appealed was based.
B. Application. An application for an appeal shall (1) be filed with the
Chairperson, (2) specify the grounds for such an appeal, (3) include the
legal description of any property involved with the appeal, (4) be
accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the
filing fee, and (5) provide such additional information as may be prescribed
by rule of the Board.
C. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board, after the application for appeal has been filed,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, the
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which
may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on petition with
notice to the Zoning Administrator and on the basis of due cause shown.
D. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such an appeal shall
be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and
104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records
required by Section 10-101.
E. Decision. The Board may affirm or reverse, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from,
and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought
to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning
Administrator, and may issue or direct the issuance of a zoning permit
and/or occupancy certificate. No conditions may be attached to such a
decision that could not otherwise have been available to the Zoning
Administrator in making the initial decision. The Board shall render a
written decision in the form of a resolution on the appeal without
unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing and, in all cases, within
45 days after the close of the hearing.
10-4
107 Variances. The Board may authorize such variances from the terms of these
regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest and provided that
the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, aesthetics protected and substantial justice done. Variances may be
authorized only in those specific instances enumerated in Section 10-107C and
then only when the Board has made findings of fact based upon the standards set
out in Section 10-107D that owing to special conditions a literal enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in
unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee or occupant of land or structures.
According to K.S.A. 12-759(e), any such variance shall not permit any use not
permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which the variance is
requested.
A. Application. An application for a variance shall (1) be filed with the
Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the property
involved with the variance, (3) be accompanied by an ownership list as
required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4) contain the
following information as well as such additional information as may be
prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. The particular requirements of these regulations which prevent the
proposed use or construction;
2. The characteristics of the subject property which prevent compliance
with the requirements of these regulations;
3. The reduction of the minimum requirements of these regulations which
would be necessary to permit the proposed use or construction; and
4. The particular hardship which would result if the particular
requirements of these regulations were applied to the subject
property.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a variance
shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103
and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records
required by Section 10-101.
C. Authorized. Variances from the provisions of these regulations shall be
granted by the Board only in accordance with the standards set out in
Section 10-107D, and may be granted only in the following instances and in
no others:
1. To vary the applicable minimum lot area, lot width and lot depth
requirements.
2. To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including maximum height and
lot coverage and minimum yard requirements.
3. To vary the dimensional provisions for permitted obstructions in
required yards including fences in Section 3-103F.
4. To vary the applicable number of required off-street parking spaces
and the amount of off-street loading requirements of Article 5.
10-5
5. To vary the applicable dimensional sign provisions of Section 7-102
regarding general standards and Section 7-104 regarding district
regulations.
6. To vary the applicable requirements in Sections 10-107C1 through 5
above in conjunction with conditional use applications for nonconforming,
nonresidential structures and uses under provisions of
Section 8-105.
7. To vary the applicable provisions permitted by the Floodplain
Regulations as found on Pages A-25 to A-45.
D. Standards:
1. The Board may grant a variance upon specific written findings of fact
based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing that
all the conditions required by K.S.A. 12-759(e) have been met which
are listed below:
a. That the variance requested arises from such condition which is
unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily
found in the same zoning district, and is not created by an action
or actions of the property owner or the applicant;
b. That granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
c. That strict application of the provisions of these regulations
from which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
d. That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general
welfare; and
e. That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
general spirit and intent of these regulations.
2. In determining whether the evidence supports the conclusions required
by Section 10-107D1, the Board shall consider the extent to which the
evidence demonstrates that:
a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the
owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the provisions of these regulations were literally
enforced;
b. The request for a variance is not based primarily upon a desire of
the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to make more money out of
the property;
c. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the subject property is located; and
10-6
d. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion on
public streets or roads, increase the danger of fire, endanger the
public safety or significantly diminish or impair property values
within the neighborhood.
E. Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose
such conditions upon the premises benefited by the variance as may be
necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 10-107D which
would reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance
upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general
purpose and intent of these regulations, including methods for
guaranteeing performance such as are provided for in Section 10-108D.
Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a variance which are
later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these
regulations.
F. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing
specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an
application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the close of a
hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing.
The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of
the Board with respect to applications for variances in order to properly
issue permits.
G. Period of Validity. No variance granted by the Board shall be valid for a
period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the
variance, unless within such 180-day period a zoning permit is obtained
and the variance requested is started. The Board may grant additional
extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without
further notice or hearing.
108 Conditional Uses. The Board may grant as an exception to the provisions of
these regulations, the establishment of only those conditional uses that are
expressly authorized in a particular zoning district or in one or more zoning
districts. No such conditional use shall be granted unless it complies with
all of the applicable provisions of these regulations.
A. Application. An application for a conditional use shall (1) be filed with
the Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the
property involved with the conditional use, (3) be accompanied by an
ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4)
contain the following information as well as such additional information
as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. A statement or diagram showing compliance with any special conditions
or requirements imposed upon the particular conditional use by the
applicable district regulations or Section 10-108D if applicable;
2. A statement as to why the proposed conditional use will not cause
significant injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood;
10-7
3. A statement as to how the proposed conditional use is to be designed,
arranged and operated in order to permit the development and use of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district
regulations; and
4. Present data in support of the standards specified in Section 10-108C.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a conditional
use as an exception shall be held and notice thereof given as specified
under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general
procedures and records required by Section 10-101.
C. Standards. The Board may grant a conditional use when it makes specific
written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to
it at the hearing which support conclusions that:
1. The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable regulations,
including lot size requirements, bulk regulations, use limitations and
performance standards; unless a concurrent application is in process
for a variance.
2. The proposed conditional use will not cause significant injury to the
value of other property in the neighborhood.
3. The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity
of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and
the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it
are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate
neighborhood so as to discourage development and use of neighboring
property in accordance with the applicable zoning district
regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will so
dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:
a. The location, appearance, nature, size and height of buildings,
structures, walls and fences on the site; and
b. The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
4. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance
with the standards set forth in Article 5 of these regulations. Such
areas will be screened from adjoining residential uses and located so
as to protect such residential uses from injurious effects.
5. Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have
been installed or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or
guarantees.
6. Adequate access roads, entrance and exit drives and/or access control
is available or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or
guarantees and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to
minimize traffic congestion in public streets and roads.
D. Conditions. In granting a conditional use, the Board may attach such
conditions upon the premises and/or the applicant benefited by the
10-8
conditional use as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out
in Section 10-108C in order to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious
affect upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the
general purpose and intent of these regulations. Such conditions may
include, but not be limited to, further restrictions on bulk regulations;
time of operation and ownership limitations; screening, landscaping and
fencing; provision of utilities, drainage and other public improvements;
additional access or access control; off-street parking and loading
requirements; and platting, dedications and/or guarantees. In addition to
the guarantees referred to below for parking and/or screening, covenants
which run with the land or the property to guarantee that conditions will
be carried out at a future date may be filed with the County Register of
Deeds. After an application is made and a zoning permit is issued for the
conditional use, failure to comply with any of the conditions placed on
such use shall constitute a violation of these regulations. In lieu of
actual construction of required off-street parking or the initial
provisions for screening, the Board may accept, in the name of the City, a
corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like
security in an amount to be fixed by the Board and conditioned upon actual
completion of such improvement within a specified time. Such securities
shall be filed with the Clerk. The Governing Body may enforce such
securities by all equitable means.
E. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing
specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an
application for a conditional use without unreasonable delay after the
close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the
hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all
actions of the Board with respect to applications for conditional uses in
order to properly issue permits.
F. Period of Validity. No conditional use granted by the Board shall be
valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board
grants the conditional use, unless within such period a zoning permit is
obtained and the conditional use requested is started. The Board may
grant additional extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written
application, without further notice of a hearing.
11-1
ARTICLE 11. AMENDMENTS
100 General Provisions for Amendments. These regulations and the districts created
under the authority of these regulations may be amended from time to time by
the Planning Commission following a public hearing and the approval by the
Governing Body. No such amendment shall be adopted except in accordance with
the procedures of this Article 11. Special use applications are not
amendments, but are processed in the same manner. (See Section 11-101 for
special uses.)
A. Proposal. Amendments or special uses may be proposed: (1) by the
Governing Body, (2) by the Planning Commission or (3) upon application by,
or on behalf of the owner of the property affected, but only in accordance
with the procedure set forth in Section 11-100B. When the Governing Body
proposes an amendment, it shall transmit its proposal to the Planning
Commission for a public hearing and recommendation thereon. (See Section
11-100D3 for Special Notice requirements.)
B. Application. When the owner of the property affected proposes an
amendment to any of these regulations or to any zoning district created
thereby, an application shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator
who refers it to the Planning Commission for a hearing, (2) be in such
form and contain such information as shall be prescribed from time to time
by the Commission, and (3) in all instances contain the following
information:
1. The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
2. The precise wording of any proposed amendment to the text of these
regulations or the exact description of the special use requested.
3. In the event that the proposed amendment would change the zoning
district classification of any specific property:
a. The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the
property and, if any, the agent representing the owner;
b. The legal description of the property and a general description
such as a street address sufficient to identify the property;
c. The present and proposed zoning district classifications and
existing uses of the property and structures thereon;
d. The dimensions of the property and the zoning lot area stated in
square feet or acres or fractions thereof; and
e. For land inside the city limits, an ownership list of the names,
addresses and zip codes of the owners of record of real property
located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area
described in the application both within the city limits and
extending outside the city limits when necessary. If such area
is located adjacent to but inside the city limits, the ownership
list, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, shall
provide similar information extending to 1,000 feet into the
unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city
11-2
limits, the ownership list shall extend for 1,000 feet in the
unincorporated area and, if the latter extends into the city
limits, then such owners for 200 feet inside the city must also be
included on the list.
C. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on
each proposed amendment that is filed with, referred to, or initiated by
the Commission. The Commission shall select a reasonable time and place
for such public hearing, and it shall hold such hearing within 45 days
from the date on which the proposed amendment is received or initiated.
An applicant for an amendment may waive the requirement that such hearing
be held within 45 days.
D. Notice of Hearing. One of the following procedures shall be selected to
provide proper notice for a public hearing for any zoning application:
1. Public notice of a hearing by the Planning Commission on a proposed
amendment shall be published once in the official newspaper by the
Zoning Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date
of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice
shall state the date, time and place of the hearing, the name and
address of the applicant and contain a statement regarding the
proposed changes in regulations or the zoning classification or zoning
district boundaries of any property. If the proposed amendment would
change the zoning classification of any specific property or the
boundaries of any zoning district, such notice shall contain the legal
description or a general description sufficient to identify the property
under consideration. If a general description is used, the
notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is
available for public inspection and where such description is
available.
In addition to such publication notice, the Zoning Administrator shall
mail a written notice of the hearing containing information similar to
the published notice thereof to the applicant and to the owners of
record of all real property within the area to be altered or changed
and to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet
of the exterior boundary of the area described in the amendment
application both within the city limits and extending outside the city
limits when necessary. If such area is located adjacent to but inside
the city limits, the area of notification shall, in addition to the
200 feet inside the city limits, be extended to 1,000 feet in the
unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits,
the area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such
notification extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the
city limits must also be included. The notice to property owners
including the applicant shall be mailed so that 20 days shall elapse
between the mailing date and the hearing date. When the notice has
been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party
to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action
taken by the Commission or the Governing Body.
11-3
The Commission may give such additional notice to other persons as it
may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include
requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting
of signs on the land to be considered in the amendment application.
2. Whenever five or more owners of record of real property owning 10 or
more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same
zoning classification initiate a rezoning of their property from a
less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification, such
amendment shall require notice by publication only and hearing in like
manner as required by Section 11-100C. Such zoning amendment shall
not require written notice and shall not be subject to the protest
petition provision of Section 11-103.
3. Whenever the Governing Body or the Planning Commission initiates a
rezoning from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning
classification of 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts
or parcels of the same zoning classification having five or more
owners of record, such amendment shall require notice by publication
and hearing in like manner as that required by Section 11-100C. In
addition, written notice shall be required to be mailed to only owners
of record of real properties to be rezoned and only such owners shall
be eligible to initiate a protest petition under Section 11-103.
E. Conduct of Hearing.
1. All hearings that these regulations require the Planning Commission to
conduct for amendments to changes in the text of the regulations or
the zoning classifications or in district boundaries shall be open
public meetings according to K.S.A. 75-4317 et seq., the Open Meetings
Act. When a proposed amendment will affect the zoning classification
or district boundary of specific property, however, the Commission
acts in a quasi-judicial capacity and, thus, may upon proper motion
proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A.
75-4318(a). No binding action can be taken in such a session and all
voting must be conducted in an open meeting.
2. Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing
in person, by agent or by attorney.
3. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall
be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the
Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule or bylaws which are
not in conflict with these regulations or applicable State statutes.
4. The Commission shall keep minutes of the proceedings showing evidence
presented at hearings, findings of fact by the Commission, motions
made and the vote of each member upon any question or recommendation.
If a member is absent, abstains or disqualified, such fact shall be
indicated.
5. The Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment from any
governmental official or agency, or any other person, firm or
corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be made
11-4
available to the applicant and any other interested person prior to or
at the public hearing.
6. The Commission may make recommendations on proposed amendments to
specific properties which affect only a portion of the land described
in the hearing notice or which give all or any part of the land
described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth
in the notice. A recommendation for a zoning classification of lesser
change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid, however,
without republication and, where necessary, re-mailing of notices,
unless the Commission shall have previously established a table or
publication available to the public which designates what zoning
classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published
zoning classifications. (See Appendix p. A-1 for Table of
Comparability for Zoning Districts.)
7. For action on zoning amendments, a quorum of the Commission must be
more than one-half of the membership as established by ordinance. A
majority of the members of the Commission present and voting at the
hearing shall be required to recommend approval or disapproval of the
amendment to the Governing Body. If the Commission fails to make a
recommendation on a rezoning request, the Commission shall be deemed
to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
8. A hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue
in the future at some stated date, time and place. At the conclusion
of a hearing, the Commission shall prepare its findings and the
factors on which to base its recommendation and vote.
9. If a meeting is called or a hearing is on the agenda and no quorum is
present, the members in attendance may agree to hold the hearing at
another meeting in the future at a stated date, time and place or at
the next regular meeting for which, when announced at the present
scheduled meeting, no further public notice need be given to continue
the hearing.
F. Report by Planning Commission. Within 14 days after the close of the
public portion of the hearing and voting on a proposed amendment, the
Planning Commission shall submit a report to the Governing Body. A copy
of this report shall also be filed with the Clerk and the Zoning
Administrator and such copies shall be kept available for public
inspection. A copy of the report shall also be mailed to the applicant.
Such report shall contain a recommendation as to whether the proposed
amendment should be approved or disapproved and specific written
determinations on the items listed in Sections 11-100G or 11-100H and on
such other items as the Commission may consider relevant. The report
submitted to the Governing Body shall be accompanied by a summary of the
hearing on the proposed amendment as required by K.S>A. 12-755(b). In
lieu of a report, the above information may be contained in the minutes of
the meeting and submitted to the Governing Body.
G. Amendments to Text. When a proposed amendment would result in a change in
the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning
11-5
classification of any specific property, the report of the Planning
Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such
proposed amendment and determinations as to the following items:
1. Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purposes of
these regulations; and
2. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or
changing conditions in the zoning districts affected and, if so, the
nature of such changed or changing conditions.
H. Review Criteria for Amendments or Special Uses. When a proposed rezoning
amendment or special use would result in a zoning change for any specific
property, the report of the Planning Commission accompanied by a summary
of the hearing shall contain statements as to (1) the present and proposed
district classifications or description of the special use, (2) the
applicant's reasons for requesting such reclassification or special use,
and (3) a statement of the factors, where relevant, upon which the
recommendation of the Commission is based using the following criteria as
guidelines: *
1. What are the existing uses and their character and condition on the
subject property and in the surrounding neighborhood?
2. What is the current zoning of the subject property and that of the
surrounding neighborhood in relationship to the requested change?
3. Is the length of time that the subject property has remained undeveloped
or vacant as presently zoned a factor in this consideration?
4. Would the request correct an error in the application of these
regulations?
5. Is the request caused by changed or changing conditions in the area of
the subject property and, if so, what is the nature and significance
of such changed or changing conditions?
6. Do adequate sewage disposal and water supply and all other necessary
public facilities including street access exist or can they be
provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the subject
property?
7. Would the subject property need to be platted or replatted or in lieu
of dedications made for rights-of-way, easements, access control or
building setback lines?
8. Would a screening plan be necessary for existing and/or potential uses
of the subject property?
9. Are suitable vacant lands or buildings available for development that
currently have the same zoning as is requested?
10. If the request is for business or industrial uses, are such uses
needed to provide more services or employment opportunities?
11-6
11. Is the subject property suitable for the current zoning to which it
has been restricted?
12. To what extent would the removal of the restrictions, i.e., the
approval of the zoning change or special use request, detrimentally
affect other property in the neighborhood?
13. Would the request be consistent with the purpose of the zoning
district classification and the intent and purpose of these
regulations?
14. Is the request in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and does it
further enhance the implementation of the Plan?
15. What is the nature of the support or opposition to the request?
16. Are there any informational materials or recommendations available
from knowledgeable persons or experts which would be helpful in its
evaluation?
17. By comparison, does the relative gain to the public health, safety and
general welfare outweigh the loss in value or the hardship imposed
upon the applicant by not approving the request?
Of those factors considered as relevant to the requested change in zoning
district classification or boundary, not all factors need to be given equal
consideration by the Commission in deciding upon its recommendation.
* NOTE: All the factors stated in the decision of Golden v. City of Overland Park, 224
Kan. 591, 584 P. 2d 130 (1978) are included in this list. In using these factors as
guidelines, modifications may be made in the criteria to more specifically relate them to
the particular zoning change in classification or special use.
11-7
101 Special Uses. Because of particular factors associated with their activities,
certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon
the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright
in districts, but are allowed as "special uses" when their proposed location
is supplemented by additional conditions such as to make the use considered
compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning
district.
In granting a special use, the minimum requirements of approval for all
similar types of permitted uses in the same district must be met, unless
otherwise reduced by a specific reference in these regulations. The
requirements may be made more stringent if there is potentially injurious
effects which may be anticipated upon other property and the neighborhood or
contrary to the welfare and convenience of the public. Such additional
conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements affecting the lot
size or yard dimensions; changing street width; the extent and location of
entrance or exit drives; controlling the size, location and number of signs;
the period and time of operation; lot coverage and height of buildings;
screening, fencing and/or landscaping to protect the surrounding property;
establishing environmental standards for air and water pollution, noise,
vibration, lighting and other such conditions; protection from flooding; and
additional improvements such as street construction, sidewalks,
utilities and storm drainage, if necessary, including platting and/or
dedications. Such conditions may be placed upon the property which is the
subject of the special use application or upon the applicant or both.
Although the official zoning map is not amended, the procedure for approval of
a special use shall otherwise be the same as for an amendment to change a
zoning district classification or boundary which is set forth in Section
11-100 of this Article including the provisions for filing protest petitions
in Section 11-103; provided, that any additional requirements which are
further imposed upon the special use shall be made a part of the effectuating
ordinance. Concurrent applications may be processed for changing zoning
district classifications as amendments and approving special uses on the same
property.
102 Project Review. In the event that certain public improvements, facilities or
utilities of a type embraced within the recommendations of the Comprehensive
Plan are classified as special uses or are the subject of a change in zoning
district classification or boundary, the consideration of such uses by the
Planning Commission in conjunction with a zoning application may also
constitute their project review of such proposed use if concurrently processed
under procedures required by K.S.A. 12-748, as amended; provided, that a
statement of findings is included in the Commission's approval or disapproval
as to whether such proposed use is or is not in conformance with the
Comprehensive Plan. In case the Commission finds that the proposed use is not
in conformance to the Plan and states in writing the manner in which it is not
in conformance, then the Governing Body shall not proceed with construction of
such a proposed use unless the Governing Body by a majority vote overrides the
disapproval of the Commission and the Plan shall be deemed to have been
amended and the Commission shall make the necessary changes in the Plan to
reflect the vote of the Governing Body.
11-8
103 Filing of Protest. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission
approves or disapproves a zoning change, if a written protest against a
proposed amendment for a specific property or a special use shall be filed in
the office of the Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the
hearing by the Commission which is signed and acknowledged and an accurate
legal description of their property provided by the owners of record of 20% or
more of any real property proposed to be altered or changed, excluding streets
or public ways, or by the owners of record of 20% or more of the real property
within the area required in the official area of notification by Section
11-100D, excluding streets and public ways and specific statutorily excluded
property as described below; then the effectuating ordinance shall not be
passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the City
Commission.
Property statutorily excluded by K.S.A. 12-757(f)from determining the
sufficiency of a protest petition when calculating the total real property
within the notification area is that which was (1) requested by the owner of
the specific property for rezoning or a special use; or (2) the owner of the
specific property requested for rezoning or a special use who does not oppose
in writing such rezoning or special use. (See Sections 11-100 D2 & D3 for
protest petition exceptions for rezoning from a lesser restrictive to a more
restrictive zoning classification.)
104 Adoption of Amendments by the Governing Body. When the Planning Commission in
its report submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of a proposed
amendment or special use including the basis therefore, the Governing Body
may: (1) Adopt such recommendation by an effectuating ordinance; (2) override
the Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of
the Governing Body; or (3) return such recommendation to the Commission with a
statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or
disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendation,
the Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original
recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new or amended
recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Governing Body,
by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such
recommendation by the effectuating ordinance or it need take no further action
thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the
Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt
of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course
of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original
recommendation and proceed accordingly.
In considering its decision under each of the above set of circumstances, the
Governing Body shall take into account the guidelines in Section 11-100H which
are relevant to the proposed amendment or special use and, having reviewed the
Commission's findings of fact and the factors upon which their recommendation
is based, the Governing Body either adopts the Commission's findings and
factors by reference or records their own findings of fact and the factors
upon which their decision is based.
The proposed amendment or special use shall become effective upon publication
of the respective adopting ordinance. If such an amendment affects the
classification or boundaries of any zoning district, the respective ordinance
shall legally describe the classification or boundaries as amended, shall
11-9
order the official zoning map to be changed to reflect such amendment, and
shall reincorporate such map as amended.
105 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations including the Official
Zoning Map(s), the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at
their first regular meeting in September to consider amendments, if any, to
these regulations. Preceding such a review, the Governing Body and other
affected governmental agencies, and interested parties should be notified of
the intent to review and their ideas requested. In preparation for such a
review, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a master copy of the current
zoning regulations on which are recorded comments and ideas brought to the
attention of the Administrator during the preceding year in order to maintain
the intent and purpose of the regulations under changing conditions and to
implement the Comprehensive Plan. Information on any relevant changes in state
statutes shall be compiled for the review.
106 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance,
regulation, amendment, special use or other zoning decision provided for or
authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved
thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an
action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the
City. In the event that an amendment to these regulations or a special use is
approved by the Governing Body, the 30-day period commences when the
effectuating ordinance is published. Such action shall be brought in the
McPherson County District Court.
According to K.S.A. 12-757-(a), if a proposed amendment is not a general
revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, such an
amendment, if in accordance with the Land Use Plan or the land use element of
the Comprehensive Plan, shall be presumed to be reasonable.
11-10
12-1
ARTICLE 12. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
100 Severability. If any provisions of these regulations are held to be
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,
then such provisions shall be considered separately and apart from the
remaining provisions of these regulations, so as to be completely severable
and the remaining provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force
and effect.
101 Effective Date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and
after their adoption by the Planning Commission, approval by the Governing
Body and adoption of an ordinance incorporating these regulations by reference,
and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.

APPENDIX
TABLE OF COMPARABILITY FOR ZONING DISTRICTS
In accordance with provisions provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(b) and in Section
11-100E6 of the Zoning Regulations of the City of McPherson, Kansas, the McPherson
City Planning Commission hereby establishes a "Table of Comparability for Zoning
Districts" as listed below. This table designates the zoning districts which are
considered to be "lesser changes" due to their more restrictive characteristics as
set forth in the Zoning Regulations.
When considering zoning district amendments, the Planning Commission and the
Governing Body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the
property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice
or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive
than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below; provided,
however, that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser
classification than the existing zoning district. If the applicant at the Governing
Body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the
application and/or the Governing Body desires to consider a "lesser" zoning change,
then such a proposed change shall be returned to the Planning Commission for
reconsideration and further recommendation to the Governing Body without further
publication or notice as provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(c) and in Section 11-104 of
the Zoning Regulations.
MOST RESTRICTIVE: A-1 Agricultural Transition District
R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Two-Family Residential District
R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District
B-1 Office Business District
B-2 Neighborhood Business District
B-4 Service Business District
I-1 Light Industrial District
LEAST RESTRICTIVE: I-2 Heavy Industrial District
Because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the MH-1 Manufactured
Home Subdivision District, MH-2 Manufactured Home Park District, B-3 Central
Business District, B-3a Main Street District, B-5 Shopping Center Business District,
B-6 Interchange Business District, and PUD Planned Unit Development District serve,
these districts are excluded from the Table of Comparability.
Although the notification for a "Special Use" is processed in the same manner
as a zoning district amendment, it is not an actual change in zoning districts and,
therefore, the Table of Comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary
for consideration of a different "Use" even if in the same zoning district. Part of
the property considered for a Special Use, however, may be withdrawn by the
applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without renotification.
EXAMPLE: If an application is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change
from R-1 Single-Family Residential District to I-1 Light Industrial District, the
Planning Commission may recommend the lesser, i.e., more restrictive B-1 or B-2
business districts without republication or mailing of new notices.
A-2
If an application, however, is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change
from the existing B-1 Office Business District to the I-1 Light Industrial District,
the recommending of the lesser R-2 or R-3 residential districts shall not be valid
without republication and the mailing of new notices.

of the
CITY OF MCPHERSON, KANSAS
ARTICLE 1. TITLE, PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION, APPLICABILITY AND
EXEMPTIONS
100 Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision
Regulations of the City of McPherson, Kansas", and shall hereinafter be referred to
as "these regulations."
101 Purpose. Responsible land subdivision is the initial step in the process of orderly
community development for residential, commercial, industrial, and other uses.
Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the
correction of defects and improper design is difficult and costly. These regulations
are designed and intended to serve the following purposes:
A. To provide for the harmonious development of the City of McPherson and for
that portion of the surrounding unincorporated area of McPherson County
where the City has extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction; (See Section 1-103
on page 1-2)
B. To provide for (1) desirable lot layouts, (2) efficient and orderly location of
streets and roadways and the extent and manner in which they shall be
improved, (3) appropriate storm water and drainage facilities.*; (4) and erosion
control standards. **
C. To provide for adequate water supply, sewage disposal, various utility services
and other improvements to protect public health, safety and general welfare;
D. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual
construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements;
E. To promote aesthetic values, preserve historically significant structures, and
conserve natural resources;
F. To reserve or dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and for open
space to preserve natural areas for watercourses, drainage ways, woodland,
rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to
protect land from soil erosion;
* Stormwater Management Policies and Design Criteria for the City of McPherson, Kansas. Copies of this document are available from
the City Public Works Department or may be downloaded from the City website at: www.mcpcity.com
** Erosion Control requirements established by the Federal Clean Water Act as implemented by state and local permits under the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Contact the City Public Works Department for details.

G. To avoid water and air pollution and the congestion of population and traffic
and to provide protection from periodic flooding conditions;
H. To facilitate safety by adequate access for firefighting equipment and police
protection;
I. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations,
various construction codes and other City and County regulations which also
affect the development of the land;
J. To establish administrative procedures necessary to assure a fair and uniform
basis for a working relationship with subdividers, developers, utility providers
and various governmental agencies, all of whom are involved in the
development of the community; and
K. To realize the goals, and to conform with the policies and planning proposals
as contained in the adopted Comprehensive Development Plan.
102 Authority. These regulations are adopted under authority established by K.S.A.,
12-741 et seq., as amended, 12-3009 through 12-3012 inclusive, 12-3301 and
12-3302.
103 Jurisdiction. These regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land within the
corporate limits of the City of McPherson as presently exist or are hereinafter
established by annexation and including all unincorporated land in the following
described area; provided, that such land is within three miles of the city limits and
not more than one-half the distance to another city: (See Subdivision Jurisdiction

desiring to vacate rights-of-way, easements, other public reservations or recorded
plats or to:
A. Divide or further divide land into two or more lots or parcels; or
B. Otherwise alter the boundaries of lots or parcels of land; or
C. Establish land for use as streets, alleys or other property intended for public

provisions of these regulations are either more restrictive or less restrictive than
comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of any other applicable
law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which
are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
B. Private Agreements. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to
abrogate any lawful and valid easement, deed restriction, covenant or other
private agreement of legal relationship; provided, that where the requirements of
these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations
than such private agreements, the requirements of these regulations shall
govern. The City does not have the right or responsibility to enforce such private
agreements.
C. Cumulative Limitations. The provisions of these regulations are cumulative and
additional limitations upon all other laws and ordinances heretofore passed or
which may be passed hereafter governing any subject matter set forth in the

1, 1992. If construction of a principal structure is not commenced on such land
within five years of recording a final plat before July 01, 2009, the development
rights in such land shall expire and thus, all revisions to zoning or subdivision
regulations becoming effective during the period vested shall then apply to such

not less than that required by applicable zoning regulations. (See Section 6-107 for
Access.)
FRONTAGE: The distance from property corner to property corner measured along
any lot line of a zoning lot abutting on a street. Each side of a lot which abuts, i.e.

setback.
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION: A community association, other than a
condominium association, that is organized in a subdivision in which individual
owners share common interests, ownership and responsibilities for costs and
upkeep of common open space, reserves, facilities or infrastructure and may
enforce certain covenants and restrictions. The incorporation document shall
contain provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space,
reserves, facilities and infrastructure as are reasonably necessary to ensure their
continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to ensure that remedial
measures will be available to the City of such responsibilities are permitted to
deteriorate or are not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest of
the subdivision or the City. If the City finds it necessary to carry out the obligations
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 2-5
required to maintain such responsibilities in order to avoid having them become a
public nuisance, the costs shall be assessed against the properties within the
development and shall become a tax lien on said properties. When a subdivision is
comprised of both homeowners and other users of the land such as commercial, the
association may be called an Owners Association.
IMPROVEMENTS, PUBLIC: Any street, roadway, alley, sidewalk, planting strip,

measured at right angles to the line establishing the lot depth at the established
building setback line.
MINIMUM PAD ELEVATION: The lowest ground elevation completely surrounding
a structure. This elevation is expressed in city datum or mean sea level.
MONUMENT: A device used to mark and identify the corners in the boundaries of
subdivisions, blocks and lots and the points of curves in the street rights-of-way.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 2-6
Usually such devices are made of a metallic bar or tube and may or may not be
encased in concrete.
OWNER: Any individual, firm, association, partnership, corporation, trust, or any
other legal entity having sufficient proprietary interest in the land sought to be
subdivided to commence and maintain proceedings to subdivide the same under
these regulations.
PARKING STRIP: That portion of street right-of-way that is unpaved and which is

provides right-of-way for the installation of public utilities (typically gas and water
lines), street signs, street lights, sidewalks, driveways, traffic control devices, fire
hydrants, street furniture, street trees and other ancillary uses. The parking strip
should not be confused with parking lanes that are often provided for as part of
street pavement.
PEDESTRIAN WAY (CROSSWALK): A right-of-way across a block or providing
access within a block to be used primarily by pedestrians.
PETITION: A legal instrument which serves as the basis for initiation of a public
improvement project. A petition is frequently used during the platting process to
guarantee the construction of certain improvements, e.g., street paving, water and
sewer lines, drainage, etc. A petition is valid if its signatures are more than 50%
either by area within the benefit district or by ownerships. Petitions are also used to
initiate the vacation of streets, alleys, easements, other public reservations and
plats. (See Section 7-103A for improvement petitions and Section 10-103 for
vacation petitions.)
PLAT: A map or drawing on which the subdivider's plan of the subdivision is
presented and which he submits for approval and intends, in final form, to record.
1. SKETCH PLAN: A map or plan of a proposed subdivision made prior to the
preparation of the preliminary plan to enable the subdivider to save time and
expense in reaching tentative general agreements by a discussion of the form
and objectives of their regulations.

land showing the character and general details of the proposed development.
3. FINAL PLAT: A formal document by drawing and writing representing a
subdivision which is prepared in accordance with these regulations to be
placed on record with the County Register of Deeds.
4. REPLAT: A new plat or a revision to a subdivision or portion thereof for which
a final plat has previously been recorded. The approval of a replat is
processed in the manner as a final plat.

All rights reserved 2-7
RESERVE: An area of property within a subdivision which is platted for specific
uses, e.g., open space, landscaping, entry monuments, recreational facilities,
utilities, drainage, floodway, etc. Typically, future ownership and maintenance
responsibilities for a reserve is set forth by a restrictive covenant which provides that
a homeowners or lot owners association will hold title to the reserve and therefore
be responsible for the reserve's maintenance. The restrictive covenant may provide
for ownership and maintenance to be tied to the ownership of an adjacent lot.
Ownership and maintenance of the reserve is not assigned to an individual, partnership
or corporation except in the case of a reserve platted for possible future sale to
a public body for a public facility. (See Section 6-102 for Land for Public Facility
Sites and Section 6-103 for Land for Open Space.)
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS: Contracts entered into between private parties which
constitute a restriction on the use of private property within a subdivision for the
benefit of property owners and to provide mutual protection against undesirable
aspects of development which would tend to impair stability of values. Such
restrictions may be set forth in a deed. Restrictions are also placed of record by
separate instruments including homeowner association agreements. Restrictive
covenants usually run with the land. Note: The City does not have the right or
responsibility to enforce such private agreements. (See Section 2-100B for Private

ARTICLE 4. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLATS
100 Submittal of Sketch Plan. The subdivider may, if deemed desirable, submit a
sketch plan in order to receive the pre-plat comments of the Development
Committee and/or the Planning Commission which may prove helpful in designing
the preliminary plat. Fifteen copies of the sketch plan should be submitted to the
Subdivision Administrator in a simple format sufficient to convey the location of
proposed streets and utilities, the general layout of lots, and to note any particular
design situations which could benefit from an early discussion of the problems. One
copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the subdivider with notations marked as
to the comments resulting from such a review process. No fee shall be charged for
the sketch plan review.
101 Filing of Preliminary Plat. An application shall be filed with the Subdivision
Administrator at least 30 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning
Commission and such number of copies of the preliminary plat as may be
determined necessary by the Commission for proper review by affected and
interested governmental and public and private organizations. Such plat shall not
be accepted for filing until the fee as provided for in Section 3-109 has been paid by
the subdivider to the Clerk. The preliminary plat shall contain the information as set
out in Section 5-100 of these regulations.
102 Distribution and Review of Preliminary Plat. After the filing of the preliminary
plat, the Subdivision Administrator shall distribute copies to affected and interested
governmental (including township) and public and private organizations as
appropriate. Organizations receiving copies shall have 15 days to review the
preliminary plat and to make their comments and recommendations to the Planning
Commission. A lack of response in 15 days shall, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission, signify approval, unless during this period a written request for an
extension of one time only not to exceed 15 days is submitted to the Planning
Commission.
103 Action by the Planning Commission on Preliminary Plat. The Planning
Commission shall review the preliminary plat and consider the comments and
recommendations of the organizations to whom the preliminary plat had been
submitted for review. If deemed desirable, the Commission may mail notices or
copies of agendas to interested parties and conduct a public hearing for the
purpose of receiving information supporting or opposing the preliminary plat.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 4-2

All rights reserved 4-3
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat
generally meets the design standards and requirements of these regulations,
the Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning regulations and other
applicable provisions of the ordinances of the City.
B. If satisfied, the Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plat and so
notify the subdivider in writing.
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not
satisfy the foregoing conditions, it may suggest modifications so as to satisfy
such conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the preliminary plat so as to incorporate such
modifications and resubmit the plat to the Commission, which shall then
grant its approval if such amendments satisfactorily incorporate the
suggested modifications; or
2. The subdivider may reject the suggested modifications or, within the time
allowed for Commission action, may refrain from taking any action thereon.
In either event, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been
disapproved and the Commission shall thereupon furnish the subdivider
with a written statement setting forth the reasons for disapproval of the
preliminary plat.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not
satisfy the conditions of these regulations and that modifications would be too
extensive or impractical, it shall disapprove the preliminary plat and
immediately notify the subdivider in writing of its action, all within 60 days.
104 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning
Commission fails to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within 60 days after
the date such plat is filed with the Subdivision Administrator or from the date the
subdivider has filed the last item of required data, whichever date is later, then such
preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall
have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation.
105 Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plat.
A. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision
by the Planning Commission, but shall signify in general the acceptability of
the proposed subdivision.
B. Such approval shall be considered permission to submit the final plat
accompanied by the information required by Section 5-101R.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 4-4
C. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date
approval was granted, unless, upon application from the subdivider, the
Planning Commission grants an extension of time beyond such period. If a
final plat for the entire subdivision or a unit thereof has not been filed with the
Subdivision Administrator within such period, or any extensions granted
thereto, the preliminary plat must be resubmitted to the Commission as if such
plat had never been approved, except that no additional fee shall be charged
for such resubmittal if there are no substantive changes from the previous
preliminary plat approval.
106 Filing of Final Plat. An application for final plat approval, together with a sufficient
number of copies as determined by the Planning Commission for proper review,
shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator at least 20 days prior to the next
regular meeting of the Commission and within 12 months after the date that the
preliminary plat has been approved. The Administrator shall transmit the final plat
to the Commission and to other affected and interested governmental and public
and private organizations as desirable for any further recommendations. The final
plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-101 of these regulations.
An application for a replat approval is processed in the same manner as a final plat.
(See Section 2-102 for definition of a REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
107 Planning Commission Action on the Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall,
within 60 days after the first meeting of the Commission following the date that the
plat with all required data is filed with the Subdivision Administrator, review and
approve the final plat if:
A. It is substantially the same as the approved preliminary plat; or
B. There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been attached
to the approval of the preliminary plat; and
C. It complies with all of the provisions contained in these regulations and of other
applicable regulations or laws.
108 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Final Plat. If the Planning
Commission fails to approve or disapprove the final plat within the 60 days
designated by state law for its consideration as stated in Section 4-107, it shall be
deemed to have been approved and a certificate shall be issued by the Secretary
upon demand, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or
waive such time limitation. (See K.S.A. 12-752[b].)
109 Submittal to Governing Body of Final Plat. Before a final plat is recorded, it shall
be submitted to the Governing Body for its acceptance of dedications for street
rights-of-way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 4-5
dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of
required improvements according to Section 7-104.
110 Governing Body Action on Final Plat. The Governing Body shall either accept or
not accept the dedication of any land for public purposes within 30 days after the
first meeting of the Governing Body following the date of the submission of the plat
to the Clerk. The Governing Body may defer action for an additional 30 days for the
purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the requirements established by
the Governing Body. If the Governing Body defers action on the plat or declines to
accept the dedications thereto, it shall advise the Planning Commission and the
subdivider in writing of the reasons therefor. Acceptance of the dedications on the
plat shall be shown over the signature of the Mayor and attested to by the Clerk.
111 Acceptance of Dedications by County. All final plats outside the City shall also
be submitted by the subdivider to the appropriate County official for presentation to
the Board of County Commissioners for their acceptance of dedications for street
rights-of-way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land
dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of
required improvements according to Section 7-104.
112 Recording of Final Plat. The final plat with all required signatures and in the exact
form as accepted by the Governing Body shall be recorded by the subdivider with
the County Register of Deeds. The subdivider shall pay the recording fee and any
outstanding real estate taxes and special assessments. Approval of the final plat by
the Planning Commission and acceptance by the Governing Body shall be null and
void if (1) the plat is not acceptable for recording in the office of the Register of
Deeds; or (2) is not recorded within 60 days after final acceptance by the Governing
Body; or (3) is not recorded within 15 days after final acceptance by the applicable
County Governing Body under the preconstruction procedures of Section 7-104C.
The subdivider shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator such number of copies
of the recorded plat as is necessary for record keeping purposes of the City and
other affected governmental agencies. (See Section 5-101R1 for title report and
Section 10-100C for Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.)
113 Unit Developments. The foregoing provisions of these regulations to the contrary
notwithstanding, an approved preliminary plat may be submitted for final approval in
separate geographic units rather than as a whole, provided the following conditions
are met:
A. Each unit of a plat of subdivision shall contain an area of sufficient size based
on physical conditions and ability to install improvements economically.
B. The approval of the Planning Commission as to the feasibility of such
development, in separate units, including the feasibility of the proposed
sequence of development, shall be secured.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 4-6
C. A final plat of at least one unit shall be filed within 12 months from the date of
approval of the preliminary plat, and final plats of all such units shall be filed
within five years from the date that the preliminary plat was approved. The
Planning Commission on application of the subdivider, may, from time to time,
grant extensions of time within which to submit such final plats, provided that
each such extension shall be for no more than one year.
D. All steps required for the approval of final plats, including the recording thereof,
shall be adhered to with respect to each unit so submitted.
E. A replat of all or a portion of a recorded final plat may be submitted at any
time.
114 Approval of Plats for Small Tracts.
A. Authorization. Any other provision of these regulations to the contrary
notwithstanding, if a proposed plat of subdivision or resubdivision complies
with the requirements of Section 4-114B, then the Planning Commission may
approve a final plat of such subdivision or resubdivision when neither a sketch
plan nor a preliminary plat has been filed by the subdivider and a preliminary
plat has not been approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Requirements. In order to qualify for approval in the manner provided in
Section 4-114A, a proposed plat of subdivision shall comply with the following
requirements:
1. The proposed plat of subdivision shall include not more than 10 acres if a
residential plat, nor more than 5 acres for any other type of plat, unless
approved for a larger acreage by the Planning Commission.
2. The proposed plat of subdivision shall create not more than 5 lots, tracts
or parcels of land, unless approved for a larger acreage by the Planning
Commission.
3. No public street or easement of access, e.g., a utility or drainage
easement, is sought to be dedicated or is contemplated or projected
through (as opposed to adjacent to) the lot, tract or parcel proposed to be
subdivided or resubdivided.
4. The proposed plat of subdivision shall be in the form required by Section
5-101 and shall contain all the data, information and certificates required
on final plats as well as the supplemental information.

C. Procedures.
1. Final plats filed for approval pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be filed with
the Subdivision Administrator who may submit such plat for review and
recommendations to affected and interested governmental agencies and
public and private utility providers as deemed desirable. The
Administrator may require the subdivider to submit topographic
information whenever the property proposed to be subdivided or
resubdivided is traversed by or is adjacent to a known watercourse,
including intermittent streams or is subject to flooding as defined in
Section 6-104.

ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
100 Scope. All subdivision of land subject to these regulations shall conform to the
minimum design standards of this Article according to the classifications of urban
and rural type subdivisions as defined in Article 7-100.
101 Comprehensive Development Plan. Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of
the Comprehensive Plan.
102 Land for Public Facility Sites. Public agencies using the Comprehensive Plan as
a guide may use the following procedure for acquiring sites for public facilities which
does not preclude voluntary dedication and mutual negotiations for land or the use
of the condemnation laws of the State: (See Section 2-102 for definition of
RESERVE.)
A. The subdivider offers to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or
authority, lands, sites and locations for parks, recreational areas, schools, fire
stations or other public facilities. As soon as the preliminary plat has been
received and reviewed, the Planning Commission shall give 45 days notice to
the public body, agency or authority that it appears that lands should be
considered for public acquisition. If within that 45 days the body receiving
notice fails to act or submits a negative report on acquisition, then the subdivision
and design thereof shall be treated as if no such request for land had
been made.
B. If the organization receiving notice replies in writing that they desire to acquire
land within the subdivision, they shall have an additional 45 days after making
such reply to make arrangements for such land acquisition.
C. The time allocated for making the above determination may be extended with
the mutual consent of the subdivider and the organization involved.
103 Land for Open Space. The following conditions may be required as part of the
approval of any subdivision plat: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE and
WETLAND.)
A. That the subdivider provide appropriate dedication of land or easements for
the preservation of open space areas within a subdivision. Such open space
may be needed to preserve areas containing natural watercourses, drainage
ways, areas subject to periodic flooding, wetlands, substantial woodland,
rugged topography and wildlife habitat; to maintain water quality and quantity;
and to protect land from soil erosion. In general, such land is not normally
considered as buildable land and should not be developed in order to maintain
the quality of the environment.

All rights reserved 6-2
104 Land Subject to Flooding.
A. Whenever a subdivision of land including platting for manufactured home
parks and other developments on one-lot plats is located on flood prone land
identified on a Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (F.I.R.M.) prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, the following requirements shall apply: (See
City Zoning Regulations for floodway and floodway fringe districts.) (See
Section 5-101 O for minimum pad elevations.)
1. Show on the preliminary and final plats the boundary lines and elevations
for both floodway, if any, and 100-year flood level; and
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
water, gas and electrical systems are located, elevated and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage, and adequate drainage is provided so
as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
105 Land Subject to Excessive Erosion by Wind or Water. On land subject to
excessive soil movement by the forces of wind and/or water and that may cause
environmental health hazards, necessary preventive measures shall be a part of the
subdivision plat. Conservation standards applicable to subdivisions shall be
adhered to which are used by the McPherson County Conservation District.
106 Project Drainage Plan. All new subdivisions shall be required to provide a Type
A, B, C, or D Drainage Report in accordance with the requirements of the
currently adopted Stormwater Management Policies and Design Criteria for the City
of McPherson, Kansas.
107 Access. All lots located in any subdivision must contain at least 40 feet of frontage
for driveways directly connected to an opened public street and not across the land
of others. Flag lots are not permitted, unless warranted by an unusual shape of the
land or the ownership of property. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FLAG LOT.)
108 Streets - Layout and Design.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable
circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographical
conditions, to the run-off of storm water; to public convenience and safety; and
in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
B. Where such is not shown on a Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-3
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in
surrounding areas; or
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or
other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impracticable.
C. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
D. If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access
highway, arterial street or railroad right-of-way, the Planning Commission may
require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with access control
provisions along the rear property line and screening, deep lots with rear
service alleys or such other design as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
E. Reserve strips controlling access of streets shall be prohibited except where
their control is placed with the applicable Governing Body under acceptable
conditions.
F. Street right-of-way requirements for other than arterials shall be determined by
the total aggregate needs for the functional components for the particular
system being considered. The total aggregates shall be in increments of even
feet, even numbers only. The components involved shall be as follows
depending upon the urban or rural type of characteristics of the street needed
based on land use, traffic and density:
1. Moving or traffic lanes may be variable from 10 to 12 feet depending on
function, e.g., low density residential, cul-de-sac residential, collector,
industrial, etc., and on design speed of the roadway. A moving lane may
utilize a portion of the surface of certain types of curb construction.
2. Parking lanes for on street storage of vehicles shall be at least eight feet in
width. For computation purposes, up to two feet for curb or shoulder may
be included as part of the parking lane.
3. A curb and gutter shall be considered to require two and one half feet
irrespective of construction type.
4. Shoulders for rural type roadways shall be not less than three feet in width.
5. Parking strips for streets shall be at least 14 1/2 feet in width from the back
of curb to the right-of-way line. This area shall be used for the installation

All rights reserved 6-5
of utilities, street signs, street lights, traffic control devices, fire hydrants,
sidewalks, driveways, street furniture, street trees from an approved City
list and to provide a transition area in grades, if necessary, between the
roadway and the property adjacent to the right-of-way. Ditches and border
strips for rural type roads shall be variable in width based on drainage,
utility installations and other needs.
6. Landscaping is permissible on state highway right-of-way and the vision
triangle on private property if shrubs are maintained to a maximum of 33 in
height and all trees are properly trimmed so that sight distance is not
restricted. The property owner will maintain said landscaping in a healthy
and trash free condition. Landscaping, which includes trees, may not be
installed within the Clear Zone area adjacent to a state highway. (See
Table CZ page 6-9) A K.D.O.T. Highway Permit is required to install
landscaping on a state highway right-of-way. (See Article 2 for definition of
VISION TRIANGLE)

These widths may be modified by the Planning Commission on a showing
that special conditions exist such as drainage and utility requirements, safe
and efficient traffic and pedestrian movement, intersection design, etc. In
applying these standards, workable street systems must be established.
When a pattern of widths based on function for a given area has been
established, the pattern shall be followed until another system can be
established or ties into a collector or arterial system. Access control and
acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required to properly handle
traffic flow and to protect the carrying capacity of the street.


G. Arterial right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan and
where not shown thereon shall not be less than 100 feet.
H. For streets and roadways on the Functional Classification System of the
County, prevailing design standards shall apply.
I. Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all
curves depending upon design speed. These distances shall be:
Arterial Streets: 500 feet
Collector Streets: 300 feet
Local Streets: 200 feet

The sight distance shall be measured within street rights-of-way from a height
of four and one-half feet above the proposed pavement surface in the righthand
lane of the roadway. (See Figure 6-C)
K. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles,
and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 80 degrees.
L. Street jogs are to be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets,
center line offsets of less than 150 feet should be avoided. (See Figure 6-B)

* Where a site specific investigation indicates a high probability of continuing accidents, or such occurrences are
indicated by accident history, the designer may provide clear zone distances greater than 30 feet as indicated. Clear
zones may be limited to 30 feet for practicality and to provide a consistent roadway template if previous experience with
similar projects or designs indicates satisfactory performance.
** Since recovery is less likely on the unshielded, traversable 1:3 slopes, fixed objects should not be present in the
vicinity of the toe of these slopes. Recovery of high-speed vehicles that encroach beyond the edge of the shoulder may
be expected to occur beyond the toe of the slope. Determination of the width of the recovery area at the toe of the
slope should take into consideration right-of-way availability, environmental concerns, economic factors, safety needs,
and accident histories. Also, the distance between the edges of the travel lane and the beginning of the 1:3 slope
should influence the recovery area provided at the toe of the slope

M. Roadway grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following with due
allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
Roadway Type Percent Grade
Arterial 3%
Collector 4%
Local 5%
Marginal Access 5%
N. No roadway grade shall be less than 0.32 of one percent, unless approved by
the applicable engineer. Greater percentages of grade may be required where
necessary to provide adequate drainage.
O. Roadway pavement at intersections shall be rounded by the following
minimum radii:
Minimum
Type of Roadway Intersection Width Curb Radii
Local Residential Local Residential 20 feet
Local Residential Collector 30 feet
Local Residential Arterial 30 feet
Commercial/Industrial Commercial/Industrial
Collector or Arterial Collector or Arterial 50 feet
P. Half streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets
where applicable, or where they are essential to the reasonable development
of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these
regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be practicable
to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof, exists and is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted
within such tract. No construction of the roadway shall occur until the full rightof-
way is provided.
Q. The length of cul-de-sacs and the dimensions of the turn-around shall be
determined as follows:
1. Cul-de-sacs in single family areas should not generally be longer than
seven times the average lot width or 500 feet, whichever is less. In multiple
family residential areas, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet.
2. In urban type subdivisions, they shall have a turn diameter of at least 70
feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, or shall have an
alternate turn-around area such as hammerheads, etc., as providing
service equal to the foregoing requirement.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-12
3. For rural type subdivisions, a minimum street property line diameter of 120
feet or more may be required for fire protection and other equipment.
R. Subdividers are encouraged to consider projects designed to maximize solar
access when not in conflict with existing contours or drainage. When the long
axis of individual structures is parallel to the street, streets should be oriented
as nearly as possible in an east/west direction. If the long axis of structures is
perpendicular to the street, north/south street orientation is preferable for solar
access purposes.
S. TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (TIA)
A Traffic Impact Analysis is a specialized study of the impact a certain type
and size of development will have on the surrounding transportation system.
Depending on the type and size of development, the TIA for minor
developments may include an inspection of the site and projected traffic
volumes for the site and adjacent streets. A TIA for major developments
should include an analysis of alternatives that includes projected traffic for
adjacent streets and regional thoroughfares. The TIA should be an integral
part of the development impact review process. It is specifically concerned
with the generation, distribution, and assignment of traffic to and from a
proposed development. The purpose of a TIA is to determine what impact that
traffic will have on the existing and proposed road network, and what impact
the existing and projected traffic on the roadway system will have on the
proposed development. A complete TIA should be provided by the developer
and performed by a traffic consultant in each of the following situations:
1. Any development which can be expected to generate more traffic than
some specific threshold (such as 100 vehicles in the peak hour of the
adjacent street or generator) or for a lesser volume when review of the site
plan indicates that such additional data is desirable.
2. Cases in which the original TIA is more than two years old or where
increased land use intensity will result in an increase in traffic generation by
more than 15% or a directional distribution in the site traffic by more than
20%.
The specific content of a TIA will vary depending upon the site and the
prevailing conditions. The guidelines for preparing TIAs should specify the
format and general contents. The following suggested guidelines represent
items normally included in a TIA.
a. Existing Conditions
b. Trip Generation and Design Hour Volumes
c. Trip Distribution and Traffic Assignment
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-13
d. Existing and Projected Traffic Volumes
e. Capacity Analysis
f. Traffic Accidents
g. Traffic Improvements
h. Conclusions
i. Summary of Findings and Recommendations
The traffic consultant should discuss the project with KDOT, city and/or county
staff at a very early stage in the study. Topics which should be discussed
include: available traffic data, any city or county plans for street improvements
in the vicinity of the site, traffic counts to be made, intersections at which
capacity using critical lane analysis is appropriate, and projected volumes
when the area becomes fully developed.
109 Alleys.
A. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the
Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the uses proposed.
Alleys in residential districts are to be discouraged.
B. When provided, the minimum right-of-way of an alley shall be 20 feet.
C. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where
necessary, a turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular
movement.
D. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such
alleys shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end.
110 Blocks and Pedestrian Ways.
A. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard
to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the
type of use contemplated.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-14
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, off-street parking and
loading, etc.
3. Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. A block should not exceed 1,340 feet in length, unless the previous layout or
topographic conditions justify a modification. In general, blocks shall not be
less than 400 feet unless necessary because of existing street patterns.
C. All blocks shall be so designed so as to provide two tiers of lots, unless a
different arrangement is required in order to comply with or be permitted by
other sections of these regulations.
D. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the
overall pattern of blocks in the proposed subdivision.
E. In extra long blocks, a public pedestrian way may be required to provide
access to public or private facilities such as schools or parks. (See Section
2-102 for definition of PEDESTRIAN WAY [CROSSWALK].)
111 Lots.
A. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building
setback lines, if any desired, shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. (See
Section 6-107 for flag lots.)
B. Lot dimensions shall conform to the minimum requirements of applicable
zoning regulations and sanitary codes, unless higher standards are
established in accordance with this subsection: Note that subdivisions located
in the extraterritorial jurisdiction must conform to the Zoning Regulations and
Sanitary Code in effect and adopted by McPherson County.
1. All subdivisions in the City shall be connected to public water supply and
sewage disposal systems as well as subdivisions in the surrounding
jurisdiction wherever the latter is deemed feasible by the Governing Body.*

* NOTE: All public sanitary sewer systems and sewage treatment plants are further
subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
2. If the proposed subdivision is serviced with a public water supply, but
intends to use a septic tank and tile field for a sewage disposal system, the
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-15
minimum lot area requirement shall be 3.00 acres with a minimum depth of
100 feet and a minimum width of 100 feet measured at the building setback
line, in the unincorporated area only. For lots to be served by an on-lot
wastewater lagoon, the minimum lot area is 130,680 square feet (3.00
acres) and the minimum lot depth and width is 275 feet.
3. If the proposed subdivision in the unincorporated area is serviced by
neither a public water supply or a public sewage disposal system and
intends to use an on lot well for water supply and a septic tank system for
sewage disposal, the minimum lot area requirement shall be 217,800
square feet (5-acres) with a minimum width of 140 feet measured at the
building setback line.
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations in Sections 6-111B2
and 3, it is the intent of these regulations to encourage the installation of
public water supplies and public sewage disposal systems wherever
feasible. In order to determine such feasibility, the Planning Commission
may require the subdivider to provide certain basic engineering data and
cost estimates on which to base such a decision. Furthermore, if on lot
water supply and sewage disposal installations are used, additional lot area
may be required if the area to be subdivided has a high water table, is
periodically flooded with water or if the soil conditions prove to be
unsuitable based on percolation tests which may be required of the
subdivider. If a lagoon system is used for sewage disposal, the lot size
must be a minimum of five acres, the lagoon fenced and the edge of the
lagoon not less than 300 feet from any existing off premises dwelling or
100 feet from the nearest property line.
C. In those areas where there may be municipal type water and/or sanitary sewer
facilities anticipated in the foreseeable future, but which are not yet available,
the Planning Commission may require that lots be so designed and arranged
that they may readily be converted to urban type building sites without
replatting. When such a condition prevails, land should be subdivided into lots
so that by combining lots, a building site is created initially with an area of not
less than that required for on lot wells and/or sewage treatment systems. The
creation of such a building site through use of multiple groups of lots shall be
contingent upon the establishment for record of restrictive covenants
satisfactory to the legal counsel of the Planning Commission, providing that no
more than one dwelling unit shall be built on such an aggregate group of lots
until such time as municipal type water and sewer service is available.
D. As a general guideline, the maximum depth of all residential lots shall not
exceed two and one-half times the width thereof. For all other types of lots,
the depth shall not exceed three times the width.
E. The area of the street right-of-way shall not be included and calculated in the
area of the lot with respect to minimum lot area requirements of these
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-16
regulations or of any zoning regulations applicable to the property. Lots shall
be required to have more than the minimum area dimensions provided for in
this section where such greater area or dimensions are required to meet the
yard requirements of the zoning regulations.
F. There shall be no double frontage lots for individual dwellings (e.g., single and
two family units), except where the lots abut upon a limited access highway or
arterial street or where the topography of the land prevents reasonable
subdivision in small units. Double frontage lots shall not have vehicular access
between such lots and an abutting limited access highway or arterial street.
G. Reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where such are essential to
provide a separation of residential development from limited access highways
and arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation.
H. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width, if necessary, to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
I. Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street line or
substantially so.
112 Easements.
A. Utility easements shall be provided where necessary and centered on rear or
side lot lines. Such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide along rear lot
lines and 10 feet wide paralleling side-lot lines, except that easements for
street lighting purposes shall not in any event be required to exceed 10 feet.
Side lot easements, when needed for other than street lighting purposes such
as drainage, may exceed 10 feet.
B. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage
way or channel or a detention pond is constructed, then a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided. Such easement or rightof-
way shall conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse and
location of a detention pond and shall be of such width or construction, or both,
as may be necessary to assure adequate storm water drainage and for access
for maintenance thereof. All drainage easements shall be vegetated with
perennial grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and sediment
movement by wind or water. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in
connection therewith. (See Section 2-102 for definition of DETENTION
POND.)
NOTE: Refer to the adopted AStormwater Management Policies and Design Criteria for the
City of McPherson, Kansas@

All rights reserved 6-17
In rural type subdivisions, a triangular drainage and utility easement may be
required at the corners of intersecting street rights-of-way. Where street
rights-of-way intersect at 90 degrees, the limit of such easement would be
defined by a line drawn between two points located on the right-of-way lines
which are 25 feet back each way from the corner. All drainage easements will
be vegetated with adapted perennial grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent
soil erosion and sediment movement by wind or water.
C. Vision triangle easements are required on any corner lot, except in zoning
districts B-3 Central Business and B-3a Main Street, to provide an open and
usable vision path for drivers of vehicles approaching the intersection. The
extent of vision triangle easements shall be based on the type of intersection
(3-way, four, protected, unprotected, etc.); the type of street (local, collector,
arterial, commercial or industrial); topography; proposed street grades (if any);
and the design speeds contemplated for such roadways. (See Figure 6-C; and
Section 2-102 for definition of VISION TRIANGLE. Vision triangle easements
are supplemented by Clear Zones along all state highways. See Table CZ
on page 6-9.)
D. Wherever a lot or group of lots side or back on to an existing high pressure oil
or gas transmission line, a building setback easement shall be established on
each side of such line to the minimum safe standards as provided by the
applicable oil or gas company to the subdivider or to such standards as may
be adopted by the City, state or federal governments, whichever provides the
most setback distance. The easement shall be provided on that part of the lot
which abuts the oil or gas line and no principal buildings or structures shall be
located or constructed within such an easement.
E. A screening easement may be required to provide for fencing and/or an
adequate area for the mature growth of landscaping with appropriate
maintenance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)
113 Commercial and Industrial Subdivisions.
A. Streets. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these regulations, the
minimum width of streets adjacent to areas designed, proposed or zoned for
commercial or industrial use may be increased by the Planning Commission to
such extent as may be deemed necessary to assure the free flow of through
traffic without interference from parked or parking motor vehicles.
B. Blocks and lots intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designed
specifically for such purpose with adequate space set aside for off-street
parking and loading.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 6-18
C. Marginal Access Street. When lots or blocks in a proposed commercial or
industrial subdivision front on any limited access highway or arterial street, the
subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a marginal access street
to provide ingress and egress to and from such lots or blocks.

ARTICLE 7. INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
100 Subdivision Types. For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions shall be
classified as follows:
A. Urban Type Subdivisions.
1. All subdivisions located wholly within the corporate limits of the City.
2. All subdivisions located partially within, adjoining or touching the corporate
limits of the City.
3. All subdivisions adjoining or touching the boundary of a tract of land for
which annexation proceedings have commenced by the City or the owner
has a pending request to be annexed.
4. All subdivisions adjoining or touching another subdivision which has
previously received final plat approval by the City and adjoins or touches
the corporate limits of the City.
5. All subdivisions which have or intend to have both municipal type water
supply and sewage disposal systems, or are subdividing all or portions of
the subdivision for commercial or industrial purposes, or for public or
semi-public purposes which are directly related to an urban type residential
subdivision. (Note: Service by a rural water district could be considered a
"municipal type" if the particular size of pipes in that location permitted adequate
quantity and pressure commensurate with urban needs.)
B. Rural Type Subdivisions. All other subdivisions required to be platted by these
regulations not otherwise classified as the urban type as described in Section
7-100A.
101 Engineering and Governmental Jurisdiction. In setting certain standards and
specifications, approving engineering drawings, inspecting improvements,
recommending acceptance of improvements, preparing petition forms and
establishing the amount of surety for guaranteeing the installation of such
improvements; the engineer designated by the City, the County Engineer, or utility
provider representative shall be designated as responsible for the improvements
within their respective jurisdictions. The term "applicable" Governing Body may
mean either the City Council for urban type subdivisions in the City, or the township
trustees or County Board of Commissioners for urban and rural type subdivisions in
the unincorporated area. "The" Governing Body refers to the City only.
Coordination to achieve cooperation among the governing bodies is the
responsibility of the City and, in particular, the Subdivision Administrator.

102 Required Improvements. As a condition to final plat approval, the subdivider of a
proposed subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in cooperation with
governmental bodies and utility companies, cause to be installed the following
necessary facilities and improvements as listed below. The design and installation
of such facilities and improvements shall include such sizing of pipes and
extensions of streets as may be deemed desirable within the subdivision to facilitate
development of adjacent land. All requirements are applicable to both urban and
rural- type subdivisions as defined in Section 7-100 unless specifically described
otherwise.
A. All streets, alleys, curbs, gutters and street drainage facilities in urban type
subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with established City
standards. All urban type streets shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt or
asphaltic concrete and no gravel or sanded roadways shall be constructed. All
roadways in rural type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with
standards established by the County Engineer with gravel or sanded surface
and no other materials such as oiled surface, macadam or similar materials
shall be used. If other than gravel or sanded surface materials are particularly
required, urban construction standards as described above shall apply. To
accommodate any future improvements in both urban and rural areas, the
entire right-of-way of collector and local streets and roadways shall be graded
to match the level of the road surface. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved,
boulders and similar items shall be removed from such right-of-way. In the
unincorporated area, streets and roadways are subject to final acceptance by
the applicable township trustee or the County.
B. A storm drainage system shall be provided, separate and independent of the
sanitary sewer system, meeting all of the specifications and requirements(*) of
the City in urban type subdivisions or the County Engineer in rural types. Such
storm drainage system shall be connected to any existing storm sewer system,
where available, or if such connection is not available, other adequate means
for the discharge of such storm water including the use of detention ponds
shall be provided by the subdivider into the nearest major water channel. If it
is determined that adequate drainage can be accomplished by a natural
drainage way across private property, a drainage easement may be required;
however, any initial channelization is the responsibility of the subdivider and
continued maintenance the responsibility of the adjacent property owner(s).
For this reason, a Developers Agreement shall be required as part of final plat
approval. If needed, there will also be a requirement for the establishment of a
Homeowners Association with a Homeowners Agreement which will take on
the responsibility for ongoing maintenance of mutual use facilities within the
development. (See Section 2-102 for definition of DEVELOPERS
AGREEMENT.)

C. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City in
urban type subdivisions under the following conditions: (Also, see Section
6-110E for Pedestrian Ways.)
1. In urban area subdivisions, Portland cement concrete sidewalks shall be
required to be installed in accordance with the sidewalk regulations as
adopted by Ordinance or Resolution, copies of which may be obtained
from the City Engineer; to wit:
a) Main Street, Maxwell Street, Northview Avenue, First Avenue, Kansas
Avenue and Avenue A shall have sidewalks on both sides of the
street.
b) Other streets may require sidewalks on both sides of the street at the
discretion of the City Commission. Where sidewalks are required on
one side of the street, they shall be placed on the East side of
North/South streets and on the South side of East/West streets,
except when sidewalks have been started on the opposite side, they
shall continue on the opposite side. Proper placement of the
sidewalks shall be determined at the Preliminary Plat stage and
recorded on the face of each Final Plat.
c) Sidewalk width shall be as set by the sidewalk Resolution and shall be
4 inches thick on a 1/2 inch bed of sand. Wider or thicker sidewalks
may be required by the governing body where conditions dictate.
d) The owner must obtain a separate sidewalk permit unless the
sidewalk is included in the original building permit.
e) Sidewalks may be built around existing trees and structures in the
existing right-of-way by special permission only. The normal
placement of sidewalks shall be in the public right-of-way, one foot
from the property line.
Such sidewalks shall be located to be compatible with a Master Sidewalk
Plan prepared by the City Engineer and approved by the Planning
Commission. After the Planning Commission approves the location of the
sidewalks, their location shall be shown on the final plat. Sidewalks may
be required in rural area subdivisions.
2. In general, sidewalks shall be constructed with the inside edge of the
sidewalk one foot outside the property line, except in the B-3 Central
business and B-3a Main Street Districts. Sidewalks located at the back of
curb are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

3. All sidewalks shall provide handicap access in conformity with K.S.A.
58-1301 et seq. and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
42 USCA 12101, as may be amended.
D. Street signs of such location, type and size as shall be approved by the
applicable Governing Body, giving due regard to the prevailing type, size and
pattern of location utilized throughout the area.
E. Wherever a municipal type water supply system or its equivalent is required to
be constructed by these regulations, such construction shall be in accordance
with the standards and requirements set by the applicable agency supplying
the water. In all other areas, a water supply shall be provided which meets the
standards of the County Sanitary Code. In those areas where there is a
municipal type water supply system, mains shall be of such size as to support
the use of fire hydrants as required by Section 7-102F.
F. Fire hydrants of the type and quality specified by City standards, but not less
than the minimum standards of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, shall
be provided wherever there shall be constructed a municipal type water supply
system. Such hydrants shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the
applicable Fire Chief.
G. Sanitary Sewer Systems.
1. Wherever sanitary sewers are to be installed as required by these
regulations, such sewers are to be constructed in accordance with
standards set by the City subject to the regulations of the Kansas
Department of Health and Environment.
2. Wherever septic tank systems or wastewater lagoons are to be used for
sewage disposal on individual lots, the determination of the suitability of the
lot(s) and the standards for installation and inspection of such facilities shall
be governed by the County Sanitary Code.
H. Underground wiring in residential subdivisions, unless found to be unfeasible,
is required for electric power, street lights and telephone service in urban type
subdivision, except:
1. For lines rated over 15,000 volts;
2. Appurtenance serving such lines which may be mounted on the ground,
such as transformers, transformer pads, telephone service pedestals and
street light poles; or
3. For those proposed subdivisions or replats of existing subdivisions located
in areas which presently have an overhead type utility distribution system.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 7-5
All such installation shall be under contract with the applicable utility provider.
Cable television, if installed, shall be placed underground in accordance with
the above requirements. Where telephone, electric, street lights and gas
lines are placed underground entirely throughout a subdivision, conduits or
cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner
which will not conflict with other underground services. (See figure 7-A)
Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous
to the public.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring underground installation
of lines beyond the boundaries of the area contained in the preliminary plat.
All utility lines for telephone and electric service, when carried on overhead
poles in other than the above urban type subdivision, shall be placed in rear lot
line easements or designated side lot line easements.
I. If screening of public or private areas is to be required, a screening plan of
landscaping and/or fencing shall be submitted for approval by the Planning
Commission and such screening installed. (See Section 2-102 for definition
of SCREENING.)
J. Monuments shall be accurately located as shown on the plat. Monuments
shall be Portland Cement concrete four inches by four inches by 24 inches
centered with a 5/8 inch diameter by 24 inch rebar or equal approved by the
City Public Works Director. Such concrete monuments shall be set at each
corner or angle of the outside subdivision boundary, points of curvature and
points of tangency of all curves on the outside boundaries, and intersections of
outside boundaries with street centerlines. Such monuments shall also be
used on each corner or angle on interior block boundaries and on the point of
curvature and point of tangency of all curves contained in interior block
boundaries. Rebar, either 5/8 or 1/2 inch in diameter by 18-24 inches in length
affixed with a plastic or metal cap which identifies the registration number of
the surveyor in responsible charge shall be placed at corners of each lot, each
intersection of street centerlines, points of intersection of lot lines and, at any
changes in angle, points of curvature or points of tangency of curves on the
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 7-6
interior lot lines of the subdivision. All federal, state, County, City or other
official benchmarks, monuments, or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the
property shall be preserved in precise position and protected from disturbance
during construction activities. If the subdivision includes paving of streets over
these official monuments, then the project shall include encasing the
monument within an approved monument box including a removable metal lid
to allow monument use without disturbing the surrounding paving material.
(See Figure 7-B.)
K. Whenever existing sanitary or storm water sewers, water lines, drainage
channels, culverts, underground or overhead electric and communication lines,
gas lines, pipe lines, transmission lines are required to be relocated due to the
subdivision or construction of improvements required as a condition of
approval of the subdivision and in the event such was not known at the time of
subdivision approval for any reason, the costs of such relocation shall be the
sole responsibility of the subdivider.
L. All work done either inside or outside the subdivision boundary shall be subject
to the Stormwater Management Policy and Design Criteria for the City of
McPherson, Kansas as currently adopted.
103 Exceptions for Existing Improvements.
A. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area
presently having any or all required improvements as set out in Section 7-102
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 7-7
and where such improvements meet the requirements of said section and are
in good condition as determined by the applicable Governing Body, no further
provision need be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements.
Where such existing improvements, however, do not meet the requirements,
the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of such
improvements so that all improvements will then meet the aforesaid
requirements.
B. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area
presently abutting or containing any existing public street of less than the
minimum required right-of-way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated
in so far as is possible so as to provide for a minimum street right-of-way width
and an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards as set
by these regulations. The applicable Governing Body shall determine what
adjustment to make where the aforesaid widening merges with existing streets
which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The
minimum right-of-way and roadway width required by these regulations may be
reduced to match an existing roadway system if the extension of such roadway
is already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision.
104 Agreement and Guarantees for Installation of Required Improvements. Except
for monuments, one of the following methods shall be used by the subdivider to
guarantee that improvements required by these regulations can or will be installed in
accordance with approved plans and specifications.
A. Fiscal sureties may be offered and the following shall apply: (See Section
2-102 for definition of DEVELOPER'S AGREEMENT.)
1. The subdivider shall enter into a "Developer's Agreement" with the
applicable Governing Body under which the subdivider agrees to install
such required improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon
the acceptances of the final plat by the applicable Governing Body and
filed with the applicable Clerk.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the construction contract for the
required improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a cashier's check,
escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the applicable
Governing Body, in the amount of at least 50% of the estimated cost of
the required improvements, including design, construction, inspection and
financing, approved by the Governing Body and based on an engineer's
estimate.
B. Petitions to the applicable Governing Body may be submitted as a means of
guaranteeing to such Governing Body the authority to install improvements at
such time as they deem appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when
the following conditions exist:
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 7-8
1. The petitions must be valid as may be provided for under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the applicable Governing Body
concurrently with the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the
applicable Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as
soon thereafter as may be provided by law. The cost of the publication of
said resolution shall be borne by the subdivider.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the County
Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and approved
by the applicable Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as
described will be liable in the future for special assessment for the required
improvements authorized.
C. For streets and related drainage only in rural type subdivisions, preconstruction
of improvements as an alternative method of guaranteeing their installation
may be used if approved by the County Governing Body. In this event, the
subdivider may request such Governing Body to hold the final plat acceptance
until such time as an inspection certifies that the required improvements have
been properly constructed. Such a preconstruction procedure shall be
temporarily conditioned on subsequent acceptance of the final plat and a time
limit for actual construction mutually agreed upon. Maintenance guarantees
may also be required if deemed desirable.
D. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter
from the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have
been made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective
services.
E. Monuments and bench marks shall be installed and their installation certified
by a licensed land surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with
the County Register of Deeds. (See Section 5-101Q1 for Land Surveyor's
Certificate.)
105 Off-site Improvements. The applicable Governing Body may, upon making a
finding of necessity, require the subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements
located outside the perimeter of a subdivision if such need is substantially
created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improvements should be within
dedicated rights-of-way or easements and serve a public purpose. The financing
and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the
same as on-site improvements under Section 7-104. The applicable Governing
Body may require such subdivision to participate in the following facilities and
improvements, or any other off-site improvements as recommended by the Planning
Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:

ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
100 Submittal of Petitions. If petitions are proposed to meet the requirements of
Article 7, the subdivider shall so indicate at the time of submittal of the preliminary
plat. If the petition method is authorized by the applicable Governing Body, petitions
shall accompany the final plat for approval by such Governing Body.
101 Final Improvement Plans. When the use of petitions has not been requested by
the subdivider or authorized by the applicable Governing Body and a letter(s) of
satisfactory arrangements from a utility provider(s) are not being utilized to
guarantee improvements (See Section 7-104D for letter from utility), the subdivider
shall have prepared by an engineer (which may be contracted for privately or with
any governmental agency or utility), engineering drawings for proposed required
improvements containing the data and information specified in Section 8-101A.
Such drawings shall be certified by a licensed engineer and shall be submitted to
the applicable reviewing official in duplicate at least 20 days prior to the date that
approval is requested.
A. Content. The engineering drawings shall contain the following data plus
additional information deemed necessary by the applicable engineer:
1. Plans, details, specifications and cost estimates for roadway, alley and
sidewalk construction; including plans, profile indicating existing topography
and elevation including curb and sidewalk elevation when required,
intersection control elevation and paving geometrics for each street with a
typical cross section of the roadway. The profiles of grade lines shall be
shown to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one inch
equals 10 feet vertical; or to a scale approved by the applicable engineer.
This information shall be shown on standard plan and profile sheets unless
otherwise required by the engineer and use topographic information cited
in Section 5-100B3.
2. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed storm
drainage improvements.
3. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed water
distribution system, water supply facilities and fire hydrants.
4. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed
sanitary sewage system.
5. All plans for other utilities such as for electric, gas and telephone shall be
prepared by or at the direction of the utility providing the service.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 8-2
B. Review. The applicable engineer, official or agency responsible for
determining specifications and standards shall review all engineering drawings
in order to determine whether such drawings are consistent with the approved
final plat and comply with the design standards. If such drawings are
consistent and so comply, the reviewing official shall forward to the applicable
Governing Body a notice to that effect. In the event that the drawings do not
so comply, the reviewing official shall notify the subdivider of the specific
manner in which such drawings do not comply, and he may then correct such
drawings. If such drawings are not corrected, the reviewing official shall
forward to such Governing Body a notice as to the items of nonconformity or
noncompliance.
102 Construction of Improvements. No improvements shall be constructed nor shall
any work preliminary thereto be done, except as provided for under a
preconstruction agreement in rural type subdivisions, until such time as the
engineering construction drawings shall have been approved and there shall have
been compliance with all of the requirements relating to the Developer's Agreement
and such guarantees as are specified in Section 7-104 of these regulations.
A. Inspection. All improvements constructed or erected shall be subject to
inspection by the applicable engineer or official responsible for setting and
enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the required
improvements. The cost attributable to all inspections required by these
regulations shall be charged to and paid by the subdivider. In so far as is
possible, the subdivider shall give at least 48 hours notification to such official
prior to the performance of any inspection work.
B. Inspection Procedures. After notice is received as specified in Section 8-102A
above, the applicable engineer or official designated may conduct an on-site
inspection to determine that the work complies with the approved engineering
plans and specifications. If in the opinion of such engineer or official, the work
does not comply with such final drawings, he shall have authority to order that
all such work shall be terminated until such time as necessary steps are taken
to correct any defects or deficiencies. Upon the correction of such defects or
deficiencies, the subdivider shall again notify the applicable engineer or official
as provided in Section 8-102A that the work is again ready for inspection.
C. Final Inspection. Upon completion of all improvements within the area covered
by the final plat, the subdivider shall notify the applicable engineer or official
designated in Section 8-102A above, who shall thereupon conduct a final
inspection of all improvements installed. If such final inspection indicates that
there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as installed, or if
there are any deviations in such improvements as installed from the final
engineering plans and specifications, he shall notify the subdivider in writing
and the subdivider shall, at his sole cost and expense, correct such defects or
deviations within six months of the date of notification. When such defects,
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 8-3
deficiencies or deviations have been corrected, the subdivider shall notify the
official that the improvements are again ready for final inspection. After the
final inspection is made and before acceptance of the improvement by the
applicable Governing Body, the subdivider shall file a statement with the
engineer or official which is executed by the subdivider, certifying that all
obligations incurred in the construction of the improvement involved have been
properly paid and settled.
103 Acceptance of Improvements. If a final inspection indicates that all improvements
as installed contain no unacceptable defects, deficiencies or deviations, within 15
days from the submission of the subdivider's statement of obligation paid, the
applicable engineer or official designated shall certify to the applicable Governing
Body and utility provider(s) that all improvements have been installed in conformity
with the engineering plans and specifications accompanying the final plat. Upon the
receipt by the applicable Governing Body of such notification and in conformity with
the requirements of these regulations and all other applicable statutes, ordinances
and regulations, such Governing Body shall thereupon by resolution or utility by
letter formally accept such improvements. The improvements shall become the
property of such Governing Body or utility provider involved. Prior to this final
action, however, neither the acceptance of the final plat, any subsequent
annexation to the City or irrespective of any act(s) of employees, such actions shall
not constitute their formal acceptance of improvements.

ARTICLE 9. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS
100 General Intent. The Planning Commission hereby delegates to and designates the
Subdivision Administrator authority for approving or disapproving lot splits in
accordance with the regulations of this Article. If necessary, appeals from a
decision of the Subdivision Administrator may be made to the Planning Commission
for a final determination.
101 Application Procedure. An application with the required fee for a lot split approval
shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator by the owner of the land. (See
Section 3-109 for Fees.) One copy of a drawing to scale of the lots involved if there
are no structures on the lot shall accompany the application or one copy of a survey
if there are structures on the lot showing the precise location of structures thereon.
Each drawing or survey shall show the location, dimensions and legal description of
the proposed split; the square footage contained in each portion of the original lot;
all existing easements including public reservations such as building setback lines
or access control and a certificate of approval as worded in Section 9-102C.
102 Approval Guidelines. Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on
the following guidelines:
A. A lot split shall not be approved if any of the following situations exist:
1. A new street or alley is needed or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is
required and has not been satisfied.
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g.,
utilities, drainage, sidewalks, traffic control, streets, etc. or will interfere with
maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. There is less street right-of-way than required by these regulations or the
Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by separate
instrument.
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. Such split will result in a lot without direct access from its frontage to an
opened public street. (See Section 6-107 for Access.)
7. A substandard sized lot will be created or an existing structure will not be
able to meet all yard requirements according to applicable zoning
regulations or sanitary code.

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
100 Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.
A. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Planning Commission, a
preliminary or final plat may be withdrawn from consideration either before or
after approval by the Commission. Upon approval of the request by a motion
of the Commission, the Subdivision Administrator is automatically directed to
remove the case file from the City records.
B. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Clerk, a final plat for which
dedications, if any, have been accepted by the applicable Governing Body
may be vacated by motion of such Governing Body; provided, that (1) the plat
has not been recorded; (2) no lots have been sold or transferred; and (3) no
improvements have been installed. After the plat is vacated, the Administrator
shall see that all fiscal sureties are returned to the subdivider except for those
expenditures which have been incurred by the City or County in administrative,
legal or engineering costs prior to the date of the request for vacation. Upon
the return of such sureties, the Administrator is automatically directed to
remove the case file including any petitions from the City records.
C. Upon determining from the County Register of Deeds that a final plat has not
been recorded within 60 days from its final acceptance by the Governing Body
or within 15 days after a final acceptance by the County Governing Body
under the preconstruction procedures of Section 7-104C, the Administrator
shall notify the subdivider that the plat is null and void and that the case file
will be removed from the City records within 30 days unless a reapplication for
platting is received during that time. (See Section 4-112 for Recording of Final
Plat.)
101 Vacation of Recorded Plat.
A. (Inside the City or in the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area.)
Recorded plats may be vacated by either replatting according to Section
10-101A1 below or directly vacated according to Section 10-101A2:
1. According to K.S.A. 12-512b, any recorded plat or part thereof or street,
alley or other public reservation, including, without limitation, easements,
dedicated building setback lines and access control, whether established
by instrument, condemnation or earlier plats, shall be vacated both as to
use and as to title without any further proceedings upon the filing and
recording with the County Register of Deeds in accordance with K.S.A.
12-403, any plat or replat duly executed in accordance with these
regulations which embraces the same lands as those heretofore embraced
by the earlier plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 10-2
Streets, alleys or other public reservations which may be vacated shall
revert, as provided for in K.S.A. 12-506, to abutting property owners
according to their frontage thereon; provided, that such land to be reverted
was derived directly or indirectly from the owner of the land from which
such street, alley or public reservation was originally platted. The proper
completion of the Owner's Certificate and Dedication as required by
Section 5-101 Q 2 shall constitute appropriate notice to all persons having
property rights or interests affected by the above platting or replatting.
2. Recorded plats may also be vacated without replatting. The procedure is
the same as provided for in Section 10-103.
102 Correction of Platting Errors.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-420, procedures are provided to correct certain platting
errors. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles,
bearings, subdivision or street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of
dimension or elevation or other details of the plat, except in connection with
the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that part of the
plat containing the error is under the ownership of the person who caused the
plat to be prepared, the applicable City or County Engineer, after substantiation
of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit with the County Register
of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the nature and
extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Register of Deeds shall
record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation
that the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where
it is recorded. The filing of the affidavit shall correct any such errors, but shall
have no effect on the validity of the plat or any property interest recorded by
reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with the
Subdivision Administrator. The County will bill the person requesting the
correction for engineering costs and recording fees.
103 Vacation of Streets, Alleys, Easements and Plats.
A. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 12-504 and 505, the following
procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public reservations
such as, but not limited to public easements, dedicated building setback lines,
access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of recorded plats:*
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of
platted land or the owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street,
alley, easement or other public reservation may be filed with the Clerk and
transmitted to the Subdivision Administrator for processing. All
nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section
3-109 for Fees.)
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants
All rights reserved 10-3
The Planning Commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a
proposed vacation by publication once in the official city newspaper by the
Subdivision Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date
of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall
state (1) the nature of the vacation petition, (2) the legal description of the
property and (3) the date, time and place for the hearing before the
Planning Commission. The notice may contain the information that the
hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in
the future at some stated date, time and place. Furthermore, the
Commission by rule shall mail a notice at least 20 days before the
hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for
vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any
segment remaining open; and owners on the opposite side of the street
from vacations of setbacks and access control. The petitioner(s) shall
provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator,
including names, addresses and zip codes. Such notice to providers
and landowners shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse
between the mailing date and the hearing date.
2. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a
recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should
be approved or disapproved and with or without conditions attached. At
the hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear such testimony as may be
presented or as may be required in order to fully understand the true nature
of the petition and the propriety of recommending the same. If the
Planning Commission determines from the testimony presented that:
a. due and legal notice has been given;
b. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
c. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
d. in justice to the petitioner(s) the vacation should be granted;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be
approved and entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may
provide for the reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser property
rights for public utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public service
facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for the future.
The recommendation may be conditioned upon the petitioner's
responsibility to remove or relocate all underground or surface utilities or
paving in or on the vacated land. The petition shall not be recommended
by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written

boundaries of the City, i.e., the land could also be "deannexed".

objection is filed with the Clerk, at or before the hearing, by any owner who
would be a proper party to the petition, but has not joined therein.
Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is
proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be recommended by the
Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written
objection is filed with the Clerk by any owner of lands which adjoin the
portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning Commission
to the Governing Body shall be made in the same manner as provided
by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of a final plat. (See
Sections 4-107 and 108 for the 60-day time period for consideration of a
plat and Section 4-110 for Governing Body approval procedure.) The
Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing
Body will consider the recommendation on the vacation.
Following the approval of the vacation by the Governing Body in the form
of an order, the Clerk shall certify a copy of the order to the County Register
of Deeds; however, such certification shall be withheld until such time
as any conditions attached to the order have been satisfied. The Register
of Deeds shall note on the recorded plat of the "townsite," i.e., the City, or
the applicable platted addition, the words, "canceled by order" or
"canceled in part by order" and give the book and page where recorded.
B. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 14-423 and 423a, the following
procedures are provided to vacate streets, avenues, alleys or lanes, and
including all or part of recorded plats, but not to include public easements,
dedicated building setback lines or access control:
1. Petitions for vacations may be accepted by the Subdivision Administrator
from any person or governmental agency. All nongovernmental petitions
will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) The
Governing Body shall consider such vacation on its agenda and may make
inquiry to any person, staff, utility provider or governmental agency it
desires in order to determine the desirability of the vacation. No public
hearing is required. If approved, the City Clerk shall publish the
effectuating ordinance. Immediately upon publication, the City Clerk shall
file a certified copy with the County Clerk to enter on the transfer records
and then record the ordinance with the County Register of Deeds. No fee
shall be charged by either office. The ordinance shall provide that the
vacation shall become effective 30 days after publication unless one or
more interested parties file a written protest with the City Clerk before the
expiration time. If such a protest is made, the Governing Body shall set a
hearing date 10 days after the end of the 30-day waiting period and the
protester(s) notified. The hearing may be continued from time to time and
at the conclusion the Governing Body shall adopt a resolution confirming
the vacation ordinance and filing the same with the County Clerk and
Register of Deeds as before. If the resolution is not adopted, the vacation
ordinance shall become null and void and the County Clerk and Register of

Deeds so notified. Whenever a street, avenue, alley or lane is vacated
whether in a plat or not, the same shall revert to the adjacent owners in
proportion to their frontage or proportion as to how it was acquired.
C. (In the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area only.)
According to K.S.A. 58-2613 through 2615, the following procedures are
provided to vacate streets, alleys, public easements or public reservations,
e.g., building setback lines and access control, and including all or parts of
recorded plats:
1. The owners of any platted land proposed for vacation or the adjoining
owners on both sides of any street, alley, public easement or public
reservation, or part thereof, may file a petition to vacate with the Board of
County Commissioners. Upon such filing, the County Commissioners shall
fix a date, time and place for a hearing and publish a notice in the official
county newspaper. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of
such publication and the date set for the hearing. State statutes also
require that notice of the hearing be given to the City Governing Body and
the Planning Commission.
If the Commissioners are satisfied at the hearing that:
a. proper notice has been given;
b. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
c. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
then the Commissioners shall order such vacation be made and entered in
the minutes of the proceedings. Such order shall protect and provide for the
property rights of public utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public
service facilities in existence and use. No such vacation shall be granted;
however, if the City Governing Body protests against such vacation.
Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is
proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be granted if a written
objection is filed with the County Clerk by any owner of land which adjoins
the portion to be vacated. The Clerk shall record a certified copy of the
order with the County Register of Deeds. The petitioner shall pay the Clerk
any cost of the proceedings including publication and recording costs.
2. Prior to the above hearing by the Board of County Commissioners, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a
recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should
be recommended for approval by the County Commissioners with or
without conditions attached or protested against. The Commission by rule
shall mail a notice 10 days before the hearing to all affected utility
providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting

a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; owners
on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access
control; and the County Engineer. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of
such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including
names, addresses and zip codes. All nongovernmental petitioners will be
billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for fees.) The Planning
Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will
consider the vacation and the date, time and place of the County
Commissioners' hearing. Unless the Governing Body deems it desirable to
protest the vacation, a resolution shall be adopted to recommend the
vacation to the County Commissioners which may or may not be subject to
conditions. If conditions are required, the City Clerk may refrain from
certifying the resolution until such time as the conditions are satisfied. After
certification, the City Clerk will provide the petitioner with a copy of the
resolution to be submitted to the County Commissioners.
3. In the event that the County has designated their planning board to hold
the public hearing on the vacation, the certified resolution should be
submitted for their hearing.

ARTICLE 12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
100 Amendment Procedure. These regulations may be amended at any time after the
Planning Commission shall have held a public hearing on the proposed
amendment. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the official
city newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the publication date
and the date of such hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place for the
hearing and shall describe such proposed amendment(s) in general terms. The
hearing may be adjourned from time to time. At its conclusion, the Planning
Commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the entire membership of the Commission adopt the proposed
amendments to these regulations and submit them, together with the written
summary of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. The Governing Body
either may: (1) Approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the
Planning Commission recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Council; or
(3) return the same to the Commission for further consideration, together with a
statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or
disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendations, the
Commission after considering the same, may resubmit their original
recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit new and amended
recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the Governing
Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt
such recommendations by an ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If
the Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body
following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing
Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part
of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed
accordingly. The amended regulations shall become effective upon publication of
the respective adopting ordinance. A copy of such legal publication shall be added
to the Appendix of these regulations.
101 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations, the Planning Commission
shall annually hold a public review at its regular meeting in January to consider
amendments, if any, to these regulations. Notification of such a public review may
be distributed to governmental agencies and interested parties. If amendments are
deemed desirable, the amendment procedure as described in Section 12-100 shall
be followed. During the intervening period between reviews, the Subdivision Administrator
shall maintain a list of possible amendments which may be periodically
brought to his or her attention.
102 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance,
regulation or decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be
reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any
decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a
final decision is made by the City. Such action shall be brought in the McPherson
County District Court.
