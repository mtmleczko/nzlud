PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of Manhattan, Kansas, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of chapter 6 is 6-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-2 and 6-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-2.1, 6-2.2 and 6-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Be It Ordained By The Governing Body Of The City Of Manhattan Kansas: 
    Section 1. The Code of Ordinances, consisting of chapters 1 through 34, each inclusive, and constituting a codification of the city's ordinances in conformity with sections 12-3014 and 12-3015 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, as authorized by Ordinance Number 3798, is hereby adopted and enacted as the "Code of Ordinances, City of Manhattan, Kansas," and the same shall be treated and considered as a new and comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all other general and permanent ordinances passed by the governing body on or before March 17, 1981, to the extent provided in section 2 hereof. 
    Section 2. All provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect from and after the 18th day of October, 1981, and all ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the governing body on or before March 17, 1981, and not included in such Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the 18th day of October, 1981. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of such Code. Such repeal shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Whenever in such Code an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of such Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court, as provided in section 1-7 of such Code. 
    Section 5. Any and all additions and amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the governing body to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in such Code so that reference to the "Code of Ordinances, City of Manhattan, Kansas," shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. In case of the amendment of any section of such Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in section 4 of this ordinance and section 1-7 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
    Section 7. Any ordinances adopted after September 16, 1980, which amend or refer to ordinances which have been codified in such Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of such Code. 
    Section 8. One (1) copy of such Code shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk with the ordinance books of the city, and such copy shall constitute an ordinance book, as provided in section 12-3015 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated. It shall be the duty of the city clerk, or someone authorized by the clerk, to maintain such copy by inserting in their designated places all amendments and ordinances which indicate the intention of the governing body to make the same a part of such code, when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and by extracting from such copy all provisions which are repealed by the governing body. This copy of such Code shall be available to all persons desiring to examine the same. 
    Section 9. It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the City of Manhattan to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 4 of this ordinance. 
    Section 10. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed. 
    Section 11. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval and publication in the official city newspaper of the City of Manhattan.

Whenever any ordinance expresses the intent of the governing body that it be made a part of this Code and the same is thereafter included in a supplement to this Code, such inclusion shall have the same force and effect as if the ordinance had been included at the time of the original adoption of this Code by the governing body.

State Law reference- Amendments to looseleaf codes, K.S.A. 12-3015. 
Sec. 1-5. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the governing body. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the governing body or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections (_______ to _______)" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-6. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the governing body that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the governing body without the incorporation in this Code of any such invalid or unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
Sec. 1-7. - General penalty for violation of Code; continuing violations. 
    Whenever in this Code or in any ordinances of the city an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment as may be just for any one offense, recoverable with costs of suit, together with judgment of imprisonment until the fine and costs are paid or satisfied. Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
Sec. 1-8. - Class A violations.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any person possessing or consuming alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverage upon the premises has been permitted to possess or consume such alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverage by the owner, officer and employee of said establishment. This section shall not apply to the dispensing of cereal malt beverage or the serving of alcoholic liquor as set forth in subparagraphs 4-3(b)(2) and 4-3(b)(3) above. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for the owner, operator or manager of any establishment licensed as an on-premises cereal malt beverage retailer to allow or permit any person under the age of 18 to enter or remain upon such premises between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. if cereal malt beverages are available for sale or being consumed on the premises, unless: 
(1)  Such person under the age of 18 is accompanied by a parent or guardian; or 
(2)  Such person under the age of 18 is an employee of such establishment, and is not involved in the dispensing or selling of cereal malt beverages.

(iii)  Any convictions occurring during a person's lifetime shall be taken into account when determining the sentence to be imposed.

Sec. 6-22. - Running at large prohibited. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for the owner, keeper or harborer of any dog to permit such dog to run at large in the city at any time. Any dog shall be presumed to be running at large, and the owner, keeper or harborer shall be presumed to have permitted it to be at large, in the following circumstances: 
(1)  When such dog is found off of the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer of such dog. Provided that, it shall be a defense for a person charged under this section that such dog was merely passing along the streets, sidewalks, avenues, or parks of the city, or upon any private property, with the consent of the owner of said property, while such dog was held upon a leash, chain, rope or harness by its master or keeper in a manner that effectively restrained the dog from interfering with, damaging, or injuring the person or property of others. 
(2)  When such dog is tethered in such a manner in which it can cross outside the premises of the owner onto public property, public right-of-way, or private property owned by any person other than the owner. 
(b)  It shall not be a violation of subsection (a) for a dog to run at large in a city-designated dog park. It shall not be a violation of subsection (a) or for a dog to run at large during a city-sponsored special event or during a special event for which the city has issued a special event permit if the city manager, or his designee, has determined that dogs at large will not pose a hazard to public health or safety or constitute a nuisance. However, in no such case shall a dog that has been determined to be dangerous, pursuant to section 6-25, be permitted to be at large. Further, it is a violation of subsection (a) if a dog at large at a city-designated dog park or special event meets the definition of an aggressive dog at large, pursuant to section 6-30. 
(c)  It shall be lawful for an animal control officer or officer of the Riley County police department to pursue and capture such dog running at large. If the dog appears to be vicious or if it appears that the dog cannot be captured without endangering some person, the officer is authorized to use that force reasonably necessary to restrain or kill the dog.

(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person who owns, keeps or harbors an animal to fail to prevent such animal from becoming a nuisance. An animal shall be considered a nuisance if it: 
(1)  Damages, soils, defiles or defecates on private property other than its owner's, keeper's or harborer's, or on public rights-of-way or recreation areas, unless such waste is immediately removed and properly disposed of by its owner, keeper or harborer; 
(2)  Causes unsanitary, dangerous or offensive conditions; and/or, 
(3)  Chases vehicles, or molests, attacks or interferes with persons or domestic animals on property other than property of its owner, harborer or keeper.

Sec. 6-25. - Dangerous dogs. 
(a)  As used in this section, "dangerous dog" shall mean and include any of the following: 
(1)  Any dog which has a propensity, tendency or disposition to attack unprovoked, to cause injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or domestic animals; or 
(2)  Any dog which has attacked a human being or domestic animal without provocation; or 
(3)  Any dog kept or harbored primarily, or in part, for the purpose of dog fighting, or any dog trained for dog fighting; or 
(4)  Any dog, not owned by a governmental or law enforcement unit, used primarily to guard public or private property; or 
(5)  Any dog that has been determined to be a dangerous dog in an administrative hearing pursuant to subsection 6-25(d); or 
(6)  Any dog that has become a dangerous dog upon first conviction pursuant to subsection 6-30(c) and upon second conviction pursuant to subsection 6-30(b). 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to own, keep or harbor a dog that such person knows, or reasonably should know, to be a dangerous dog, unless the owner, keeper or harborer complies with all of the following requirements: 
(1)  Confinement. The dangerous dog shall be confined, as set forth hereinafter. "Confined," as that term is used in this section, shall mean such dog is securely kept indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or dog-run area made of at least nine-gauge chain link with no more than one-inch spacing. Said pen or run must be locked with a key or combination lock whenever such dog is within the structure. Said pen or dog-run area must have sides at least six feet high and be secured over the top. If the pen or dog-run area has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than one foot deep. No dangerous dog may be kept on a porch, patio, or in any part of a structure that would allow the dog to exit the structure on its own volition. No dangerous dog may be kept in a structure when the windows are open or when screened windows or doors are the only obstacle preventing the dog from exiting the structure. 
(2)  Leash and muzzle. When the dangerous dog is not confined pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the dog shall be securely muzzled and restrained with a leash, chain, rope, or harness having a minimum tensile strength of 300 pounds and not exceeding four feet in length. 
(3)  Notice. The owner, keeper, or harborer shall display, in a prominent place on the premises where the dog is kept, a sign easily readable by the public using the words "Beware of Dog." In addition, a similar sign shall be posted on the pen or run of such animal. 
(4)  Registration and reporting. The owner, keeper or harborer of a dangerous dog shall properly license the dog pursuant to section 6-36 of this Code, and pursuant to the provisions set forth in this subsection. In addition to having, or obtaining, the license required by section 6-36, an owner, keeper or harborer of a dangerous dog shall submit a completed application for a dangerous dog license to the city clerk or his/her designee, on or before May 1, 2007, or within five business days of the date upon which the dog would be deemed to be dangerous under the provisions of this section, if such occurs after May 1, 2007. The application for a dangerous dog license shall be submitted on forms provided by the city clerk, and to be considered a completed application it shall be accompanied by all documents and other information required hereunder. Upon issuance, the dangerous dog license shall be effective for one year from the date of issuance, or for the duration of the liability insurance required by this section, whichever is shorter, and shall be reapplied for prior to its expiration. Such dangerous dog license shall not be transferable, and shall expire whenever changes occur that would make the keeper or harborer ineligible to obtain a license. The owner, keeper or harborer of the dangerous dog shall pay a $50.00 annual registration fee for each dangerous dog, and such fee shall be submitted with the application for a dangerous dog license. No dog shall be considered to be unlicensed under the terms of this subsection, if the owner, keeper or harborer has timely filed a completed application, until such application has been denied. The owner, keeper or harborer of the dangerous dog shall maintain with the city clerk or his/her designee the address where the dangerous dog is primarily kept or harbored. The owner, keeper or harborer shall notify the city clerk or his/her designee within five business days if any of the following occurs: 
i.  A change in the primary address where the dangerous dog is kept or harbored, whether in or out of the city limits; or 
ii.  A change in the person who is owning, keeping or harboring the dangerous dog; or 
iii.  The death of the dangerous dog; or 
iv.  Any change in the information supplied in the application for the dangerous dog license, or in the information submitted along with such application. 
(5)  Insurance. Any owner, keeper or harborer of a dangerous dog shall maintain liability insurance in the single-incident amount of $100,000.00 for bodily injury or death of any person(s), or for damage to property which may result from actions of the dangerous dog, or from actions or inactions of the owner, keeper or harborer related to the dangerous dog. The application, or reapplication, for a dangerous dog license, pursuant to subsection (b)(4), shall include a certificate of liability insurance that indicates the required insurance level and is valid for the intended registration period. 
(6)  Neutering. The dangerous dog shall be spayed or neutered by a veterinarian licensed by the state of Kansas. The application, or reapplication, for a dangerous dog license, pursuant to subsection (b)(4), shall include documentation showing that the dog has been spayed or neutered. 
(7)  Identification. The dangerous dog shall have an identification microchip inserted into the dog, which shall not be removed during the dog's life. The application, or reapplication, for a dangerous dog license, pursuant to subsection (b)(4), shall include documentation showing that such microchip has been properly inserted. Any owner, keeper or harborer of the dangerous dog must, prior to the issuance of the dangerous dog license, make the dog available to the city to take photographs to be used to depict the animal's size, coloring, and distinguishing features. Failure to make the dog available, when reasonably requested by the city, shall be grounds for denial of the application. 
(c)  Any owner, keeper or harborer of a dog that is a size and breed that allows the dog to be capable of inflicting life-threatening injuries upon human beings or domestic animals is hereby held to a very high standard of care regarding their knowledge of factors or incidents that indicate that the dog may be dangerous as defined in subsection (a). The court, in determining whether an owner, keeper or harborer of such dog reasonably should know about the dog's dangerousness, shall apply such very high standard. Examples of breeds to which this standard applies include, but are not limited to, the following, to wit: 
(1)  American Pit Bull Terrier; 
(2)  American Staffordshire Terrier; 
(3)  Argentine Dogo; 
(4)  Cane Corso; 
(5)  Chow; 
(6)  Dogue de Bordeaux; 
(7)  Doberman Pinscher; 
(8)  Fila Brasileiro; 
(9)  German Shepherd; 
(10)  Perro de Presa Canario; 
(11)  Rottweiler; 
(12)  Staffordshire Bull Terrier; 
(13)  Any dog, whether purebred or mix, that has the appearance and characteristics of any one of the breeds listed in subsections (1) through (12). 
(d)  In the event that an animal control officer or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a dog is dangerous as defined by subsection 6-25(a), such officer may file an affidavit with the municipal court judge, setting forth the facts upon which such officer relies to support such probable cause. Upon receipt of such affidavit, if the judge determines that the facts set forth in the affidavit are sufficient to establish such probable cause, the judge shall schedule a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the dog in question should be deemed dangerous as defined by subsection 6-25(a). The judge shall also, upon request of the city prosecutor, issue a search warrant, pursuant to Charter Ordinance No. 34, to seize the dog, and to impound the dog at the municipal animal shelter pending the determination of whether the dog is dangerous. The court shall provide notice of the hearing to any known owner, harborer or keeper of the dog. Such notice shall be served on such owner, harborer or keeper in the same manner as the service of a subpoena. The hearing date shall not be less than five days nor more than 20 days following the date of service upon the harborer or keeper. At the hearing, the city shall have the burden, by clear and convincing evidence, to prove that the dog is dangerous pursuant to subsection 6-25(a) and shall present evidence to that effect. The owner, keeper or harborer of the dog may present evidence to rebut the city's evidence. The failure of the owner, keeper or harborer to attend or participate in the hearing shall not prevent the judge from making the appropriate determination concerning the dog. After the hearing, the owner, keeper or harborer of the dog shall be notified in writing of the judge's determination. If a determination is made that the dog is dangerous, the owner, keeper or harborer shall comply with the requirements of subsection 6-25(b) and shall pay the costs of impoundment as set forth in section 6-53 of this Code within the time frame established by the court, which shall not be more than 20 days. If the dog has been impounded pending the determination by the court, the dog shall remain impounded until the harborer or keeper has complied with this subsection. If the keeper or harborer fails to comply with the provisions of this article within the time frame established by the court, and the court has not granted an extension of such time, the owner, keeper or harborer shall be deemed to have abandoned the dog and it shall become the property of the city. The city shall have the right to dispose of the dog in any manner it determines to be applicable, including the destruction of the dog. Either the city or the owner, keeper or harborer may appeal the judge's determination to the Riley County District Court, by filing an appeal, and posting the appropriate bond, pursuant to Article 46 of Chapter 12 of the Kansas Statutes. In the event of an appeal by the owner, keeper or harborer of a dog impounded hereunder, the bond for such an appeal shall include an amount to insure the payment of the costs of impoundment for 30 days and such bond may be adjusted during the pendancy of such appeal. The failure to post such bond, or any adjustment thereto, within a time frame established by the court shall be deemed an abandonment of the dog by the owner, keeper or harborer and the city shall have the right to dispose of the dog in any manner it determines to be applicable, including the destruction of the dog. If the dog is not determined to be dangerous, the court may determine whether the owner, keeper or harborer shall pay any, or all, of the costs of impoundment, taking into consideration whether other reason(s) existed for impoundment and such other relevant factors as the court determines. 
(e)  In addition to any penalties the court may prescribe for violation of this section, if the court finds, after notice to the keeper or harborer and an opportunity for hearing, that such dangerous dog represents a continuing threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, either because the court finds that the keeper or harborer is unlikely to comply with the provisions of this section, or because the court finds that, even with compliance with this section, the dangerous dog poses a threat to the public that is unreasonable, the court shall order such animal destroyed. 
(f)  No person who has been convicted of a violation of this section shall keep or harbor a dangerous dog, nor shall such person be eligible for a dangerous dog license for a period of five years following such conviction. In addition, no dangerous dog shall be kept or harbored, and no license shall be issued for any dog, if the primary location where such dog is to be kept or harbored is the residence of a person who has been convicted of a violation of this section within the previous five years. Except that, if the court permits the person who has been convicted of a violation to keep or harbor his or her dangerous dog(s) existing at the time of the conviction, the person may keep and harbor such dogs and apply for or reapply for a dangerous dog license only for those particular dog(s).

Sec. 6-27. - Dog bites; quarantine. 
    Whenever any dog has bitten a person, it shall be the duty of the owner, keeper or harborer of such dog, or any police officer of the county police department or any other person having knowledge of such incident to report the same to the health officer who may order that the dog be quarantined on the owner's premises or impounded at the owner's expense for a period of not less than ten days, and until such time as the health officer finds that such dog shows no evidence of having rabies. If any law enforcement officer of the city or of the county police department or any other person has reason to believe that a dog within the city has the symptoms of rabies, such person shall immediately notify the health officer who in turn may order that the dog be quarantined on the owner's premises or impounded at the owner's expense for a period of not less than ten days or until such time as the health officer finds that such dog shows no evidence of having rabies. If it is determined in either case that such dog is suffering from rabies, it shall be forthwith destroyed; otherwise it shall be released from quarantine. 
(Code 1973, § 2-208; Ord. No. 3345, § 6, 4-1-75) 
Sec. 6-28. - Handling of complaints. 
    When a complaint is filed that an offense has been committed in violation of this article, the municipal judge may issue a summons instead of a warrant at the request of the city attorney. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant shall issue. The summons shall be served upon a defendant by delivering a copy to him personally or by leaving it at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or by mailing it to the defendant's last known address. 
(Code 1973, § 2-208A; Ord. No. 3143, § 5, 5-1-73) 
Sec. 6-29. - Cruelty to animals.

The court shall require such person to attend, and complete, a class in responsible dog ownership training, offered by any individual or organization approved by the court. Further, the court may find the dog to be dangerous and require the owner, keeper, or harborer to comply with subsection 6-25(b) before the dog is released, if the dog is impounded.

The court shall require such person to attend, and complete, a class in responsible dog ownership training, offered by any individual or organization approved by the court. In the case of a first conviction of a person for the offense of permitting an aggressive dog to run at large, where such dog is of a size and breed that allows the animal to be capable of inflicting life threatening injuries upon human beings or domestic animals, as described in subsection 6-25(c), the court shall declare the dog to be a dangerous dog, and the court shall require the person so convicted to comply with the requirements of subsection 6-25(c).

The failure to post such bond, or any adjustment thereto, within a time frame established by the court, shall be deemed an abandonment of the dog by the keeper or harborer and the city shall have the right to dispose of the dog in any manner it determines to be applicable, including the destruction of the dog. 
(f)  Nothing contained within this section shall be deemed to prevent the prosecution of a keeper or harborer of an aggressive dog for a violation of the provisions of section 6-25, if applicable.

Upon such a deposit and written agreement, the animal may be released to the owner, keeper or harborer, or person adopting, and the operator shall provide the person with a written receipt for the deposit. The deposit shall be refunded, or paid directly to the veterinarian, when the operator of the animal shelter is provided written documentation from said veterinarian that the rabies vaccination has been accomplished. If said written documentation has not been provided to the operator within 40 days after release of the animal from the animal shelter, the deposit shall be forfeited and the operator shall surrender it to the city treasurer.

(b)  Terms of application. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, or of any agreement whether oral or in writing, whenever the building official certifies a dwelling or dwelling unit as unfit for human habitation, the duty of the tenant of such dwelling or dwelling unit to pay, and the right of the landlord to collect rent, shall be suspended, as hereinafter provided, without affecting any other terms or conditions of the landlord-tenant relationship, until the dwelling or dwelling unit is certified as fit for human habitation, or until the tenancy is terminated for any lawful reason other than nonpayment of rent; provided, that paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section shall not apply to those premises containing not more than two dwelling units of which one dwelling unit is occupied by the owner or members of his family, and also shall not apply to those premises occupied by the owner or members of his family, and also shall not apply to those premises occupied by the owner or members of his family if less than five persons are tenants of the premises; and, provided further, that paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section shall not apply unless it is shown to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official of the city that the tenant has notified, in writing, the landlord or his representative, of the alleged unfit (substandard) condition of the premises at least 14 days prior to the tenant making any request that the building official inspect the premises for determination that it is unfit (substandard). 
(c)  Standards for determining unfit housing. The building official, in determining whether any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit or fit for human habitation, shall apply the same standards as those found in the ES code defining substandard housing. In applying said standards, the building official shall consider any determination by the state department of health or the city-county board of health that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation; provided, that if the building official finds that the dwelling or dwelling unit is so immediately dangerous to the life, limb, property or safety of the public or of the occupants as to require immediate vacation as set out in the ES code, then no human occupancy shall be allowed, regardless of the rent escrow provisions of this section, until the building office determines that such immediate danger has ceased or been corrected. 
(d)  Notification of landlord or record owner. Written notice shall be given to the landlord or record owner of the dwelling or dwelling units that for up to a three-month period during which the dwelling or dwelling unit remains unfit (substandard), the tenant may pay his rentals into escrow as provided in this section. This notice shall accompany the notice of commencement of proceedings against a substandard building as contained in the ES code. No such notice of the tenant's right to pay rentals into escrow shall accompany an order to vacate under the ES code or order of demolition under the ES code. 
(e)  Appeal from building official's determinations. Any determination by the building official that a dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation (substandard) may be appealed in the manner and form set out in the ES code for other appeals. During the taking of such appeals, the tenant may pay his rentals to the rent escrow agent as otherwise provided in this section. 
(f)  Clerk of city designated rent escrow agent. During any period when the duty to pay rent is suspended, and the tenant continues to occupy the dwelling unit, the rent withheld shall be deposited by the tenant with the clerk of the city to be placed by him in an escrow account in a bank or trust company approved by the city and shall be paid to the landlord by the clerk when the dwelling or dwelling unit is certified as fit for human habitation at any time within three months from the date on which the dwelling or dwelling unit was certified as unfit for human habitation. 
(g)  Disposition of rent escrow monies. If, at the end of three months after the certification of a dwelling or dwelling unit as unfit for human habitation, such dwelling or dwelling unit has not been certified as fit for human habitation any monies deposited in escrow on account of continued occupancy shall be payable to the depositor; except that any funds deposited in escrow may be used at any time during the aforesaid three-month period for the purpose of making such dwelling unit fit for human habitation and for the payment of utility services and prorated taxes for which the landlord is obligated but which he refuses or is unable to pay. The clerk of the city is hereby authorized to accept for deposit any monies paid to him under the provisions of this section. The clerk is further authorized to pay out of the funds deposited hereunder such amounts authorized to pay hereunder as may be approved by voucher signed by the building official. 
(h)  Disposition of excess rent escrow monies. If a dwelling or dwelling unit is made fit for human habitation by utilizing escrow funds, any excess thereof shall be payable to the landlord. 
(i)  Limitations of eviction during three-month escrow period. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other ordinance or agreement, no tenant shall be evicted for a period of three months while rent is deposited in escrow pursuant to this section; provided, that such tenant during the escrow period continues to make deposits in the amounts and at the times as were otherwise established for the payment of rent under the lease agreement; provided further, that if the landlord, in good faith and without the intent to evade the provisions of this section, more than 15 days in advance of the commencement of proceedings to declare the dwelling or dwelling unit unfit for human habitation shall have given legally sufficient written notice to the tenant to quit the dwelling or dwelling unit. Such landlord may proceed with eviction whether or not the tenant invokes the provisions of this section. 
(j)  Disposition of rent escrow if tenant quits premises in less than three months. If the tenant vacates the dwelling or dwelling unit in question at any time during the period in which his rent is held in escrow, said rent monies shall continue to be held in escrow for the original three-month period of escrow during which period the monies may be used to bring the dwelling or dwelling unit up to fitness for human habitation. At the expiration of such three-month period, if the premises are still uninhabitable and if any monies remain in escrow, they shall revert to the tenant. 
(k)  Provisions of this section not subject to contract. No provision of this chapter can be waived or made subject to a contract between the parties. Any such waiver or contract shall be void and of no effect. 
(l)  When provisions of sections do not apply. The provisions of this section shall not apply if the condition or conditions which caused the dwelling or dwelling unit to be certified as unfit (substandard) for human habitation or to be in violation were caused by the tenant or by members of his family or by his guests; nor shall they apply if the tenant has refused entry to the owner, landlord, agent or other person operating the dwelling or dwelling unit or their agents for the purpose of correcting the conditions giving rise to the said certification or giving rise to the violation; nor shall the provisions of this section apply if the tenant is delinquent in his rental payments. 
(m)  Designation of deputy to building official. The city manager is authorized to appoint in writing any qualified person as deputy to the building official to act in the capacity of the building official for all purposes contained in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section.

The city shall have the right to purchase the grave space(s) at the price for which the grave space(s) originally sold and shall within 30 days after the grave space(s) is offered to the city, either purchase the grave space(s) or reject the same. 
(b)  Exception: transfer to immediate family member(s). The owner of a grave space may transfer his/her ownership interest in a grave space to immediate family member(s) at no cost to such family member(s). To effectuate the transfer, the owner shall notify the city and provide written consent to such transfer in a form acceptable to the city with a $25.00 fee for such transaction. If the owner is deceased, in lieu of receiving written consent from the owner, the successor(s) may provide proof of transfer with estate records, agreement among the heirs, or similar form as requested by the city along with the $25.00 transfer fee. 
(c)  Discrepancies. In the event there is an error or mistake in the description, transfer or conveyance of interment property, the city may correct such error, either by cancelling such conveyance and substituting and conveying other interment property of equal value and similar location or by refunding the amount of money paid for such purpose. It shall be in the sole discretion of the city as to which alternative is selected; however, the desires of the owners of the property shall be taken into consideration prior to making a selection of the alternative.

Sec. 10-17. - Unlawful discriminatory practices related to sexual orientation and gender identity. 
(a)  Employment. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer, because of the sexual orientation or gender identity of any person, to refuse to hire or employ such person, to bar or discharge such person from employment, or to otherwise discriminate against such person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment; to limit, segregate, separate, classify or make any distinction in regards to employees; or to follow any employment procedure or practice which, in fact, results in discrimination, segregation or separation without a valid business necessity. 
(b)  Housing. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions or privileges of the sale of real property or lease of rental housing, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of sexual orientation or gender identity, or to discriminate against any person in such person's use or occupancy of rental housing because of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the people with whom such person associates. This provision shall not apply to the sale or rental of real property or rental housing owned by a religious organization, nor shall it apply to a jail. 
(c)  Public accommodation. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person, as defined herein being the owner, operator, lessee, manager, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation, to refuse, deny or make a distinction, directly or indirectly, in offering its goods, services, facilities, and accommodations to any person as covered by this chapter because of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Such discrimination is not addressed in articles III and IV of this chapter because federal and state law address unlawful discriminatory practices related to those protected classes, as well as provide a complaint, investigation and enforcement process for those protected classes.

Further provided, nothing in this subsection shall create any remedy other than that which is provided in subsection (e), nor shall it be deemed to create any cause of action or claim of breach for any party.

The notice shall contain a copy of the proposed additional franchise agreement. In the event the city seeks to enter into an additional cable television franchise with terms or provisions that are more favorable or less burdensome than the terms set forth in this franchise, grantee shall notify city in writing not less than 30 days prior to the scheduled passage and approval of the additional franchise by the governing body of the city of the specific terms and conditions in the additional franchise that are more favorable or less burdensome than those contained herein. The city shall enter into good faith negotiations with the grantee to consider modification of the grantee's franchise to address the terms and provisions identified in grantee's notice.

(10)  Federal, state, and city jurisdiction. 
(a)  This agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws.

(11)  Rights reserved to grantor and grantee. 
(a)  In addition to any rights specifically reserved to grantor by this agreement, grantor reserves to itself every right and power that is required to be reserved by a provision of any other ordinance or under any other franchise. Grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of this franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the grantor determines: (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on grantee or the subscribers. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance, nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this franchise unless the statement in its final form approved by the city commission so recites. If the grant of such waiver materially impacts the competitive position of any other cable service provider, such provider may also request and obtain such waiver as is deemed appropriate by the city commission. 
(b)  Grantee reserves the right to challenge any provision of this franchise to the extent that it is inconsistent with applicable state or federal law. 
(12)  Franchise renewal. Renewal of this franchise shall be in accordance with applicable law including, but not necessarily limited to, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended.

(5)  Right of inspection. Subject to protection of subscriber privacy city may inspect all construction, reconstruction or installation work performed by grantee in the public rights-of-way under the provisions of the franchise and its general police powers, to ensure grantee's compliance with the franchise and to protect the public health, safety and welfare of city's citizens.

The city shall be responsible for the oversight and programming of the government access channel. The city may at its option, from time to time, scramble the signals transmitted over this channel to specifically designated city facilities. Such scrambling shall not interfere with other signals or with grantee's use of its cable system. The city may jointly utilize this channel with other jurisdictions served by a common headend of the grantee.

At such time, the city may request that the grantee meet with the CAC and/or the city to discuss support for the community access corporation. 
(e)  Grantee support for local programming. In the event the city, USD 383, or Kansas State University desire to upgrade or combine programming facilities, the city may adopt a resolution directing the grantee to implement a program whereby cable service subscribers are given the option of making a voluntary contribution in order to generate funds for support of the local government or educational access channel (a "voluntary check-off"). The city shall give the grantee 90 days written notice of its intent to adopt the resolution to allow grantee sufficient time to implement the program. Any voluntary check-off funds remitted by subscribers to the grantee shall be paid to the grantor in addition to the franchise fee. Grantor shall distribute the monies at its sole discretion. The initial voluntary check-off amount shall be no more than $0.25 per subscriber per month. The city shall have the authority, through a resolution adopted by the governing body, to raise the voluntary check-off in annual increments of up to $0.25 per annum, to a maximum of $1.00 per subscriber per month. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a subscriber from making contributions greater or lesser than the amount established by the grantor and the grantee shall pay such additional funds to grantor as provided herein. The grantor shall give notification to the grantee at least 60 days prior to any change in the voluntary check-off amount and grantee shall implement the change at the earliest feasible time consistent with grantee's billing cycles. Voluntary check-off funds shall not be included in grantee's gross revenue calculation and grantee shall not be required to pay franchise fees on such funds. Grantee shall only be required to remit voluntary check-off funds to the grantor that are actually received by grantee and grantee shall not be responsible for any subsequent collection of any voluntary check-off payments that are not made by the subscriber at the time the subscriber pays his or her bill. 
(3)  Complimentary service to public buildings.

Any listed public building receiving cable service from grantee on the effective date of this franchise shall continue to receive basic cable service without charge. All accredited public elementary and secondary schools shall be entitled to receive one cable drop and one outlet and basic cable service at no charge, subject to the above 125-foot drop limit. The installation of drops and outlets shall be performed in cooperation with the management of the building to which the connection is to be made. Following the city's designation of additional buildings(s) to receive cable service, grantee shall complete construction of the drop and outlet within 180 days if the city requests construction, weather permitting and subject to payment of the direct incremental costs of installations with drops in excess of 125 feet. Drops and outlets that are in addition to the one free drop and outlet required by this section shall be provided by grantee at grantee's standard commercial installation rates. Alternatively, the city or public school may add internal outlets at its own expense, as long as such installation meets the grantee's technical standards, which shall be made readily available to any public entity upon request. Service to additional outlets in public buildings is subject to grantee's applicable commercial rate. 
(b)  All complimentary service installations shall be utilized for noncommercial purposes. The city shall be subject to grantee's standard policies regarding misuse of service and prohibitions against tampering or altering the cable system. Users of such outlets shall hold the grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, including signal leakage, other than for those claims arising out of improper installation or faulty equipment. 
(c)  In instances where the drop line from the feeder cable to the public building, school or library exceeds 125 feet, grantee may charge for its direct incremental costs that are incurred in exceeding this length.

Grantee shall extend the system and make service available at regular installation and regular monthly charges upon request to any contiguous area of the city where potential subscribers can be served by an extension of the system past occupied residential dwelling units equivalent to 25 units or more per street mile. Such extension shall be performed at grantee's cost. Where aerial extension is allowed by regulation but underground installation is requested by benefited subscribers, the cost of under grounding that exceeds estimated aerial extension cost may be charged to benefited subscribers. 
(c)  Newly annexed areas. In such cases where mandatory extension of the cable system is required for areas newly annexed after the effective date of the franchise, but the technical capabilities of the then-existing cable system are such that the minimum technical performance standards required by this franchise or the FCC cannot be met, then grantee shall be required to make such extension only if grantee can earn a fair return (as measured by grantee's weighted average cost of capital) on the incremental investment required combined with the overall investment base of the cable system within the boundaries of the franchise area. 
(d)  Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent grantee from serving areas not covered under this section pursuant to mutual agreements with developers, property owners or residents. 
(8)  Customer service reporting requirements. The grantor may require grantee to periodically provide grantor with annual reports that demonstrate grantee's compliance with the customer service requirements of this franchise ordinance measured on a quarterly basis. 
(Ord. No. 6281, §§ 1, 2, 7-16-02) 
Sec. 15-18. - Right-of-way management. 
(1)  Rights-of-way construction. Prior to commencing any construction within rights-of-way of the city, grantee must obtain all necessary permits and licenses required by federal, state and city laws, ordinances and rules, and pay all associated fees. Grantee shall comply in full with any ROW ordinance of the city, as such may be adopted and amended from time to time, and all other construction regulations of general applicability. In the event of a conflict between such ROW ordinance and the provisions of this franchise, the more restrictive, as to the use of the right-of-way, shall apply. Further, grantee shall comply with all other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and standards relating to the construction, operation, and maintenance of a cable television system. 
(2)  Compliance with laws. At a minimum, and without limitation, grantee shall adhere to all building, electrical, and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the city. The construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be effectuated by grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws, ordinances, and construction standards of the State of Kansas, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical Code, and the FCC to the extent applicable, as well as all other applicable laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances that may be modified or amended from time to time. All open connections on splitters, couplers, and other devices shall be properly terminated. 
(3)  No interference. Grantee's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the city's use or occupation of the right-of-way. Without limitation of its rights, the city expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the city. Grantee shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner, which minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably determined by the city. Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement as defined in the city's design standards and specifications available in the office of the public works director. Provider shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. To the extent that the city requires any other users of the rights-of-way to implement such plans, the provider shall, prior to commencement of work in the rights-of-way, execute a resident-notification plan to notify residents affected by the proposed work. All construction and maintenance by provider or its subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with industry standards. 
(4)  Protection of the public. 
(a)  Should grantee make or cause to be made any excavation in, upon, under, through or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley or other right-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building or other material during construction and/or the night time, grantee shall cause the same to be enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption. 
(b)  Whenever grantee shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk, alley, driveway approach or other right-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the excavation until it is refilled as specified. 
(c)  Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely covered. The grantee assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. 
(5)  Excavations/street closures. 
(a)  Grantee shall not excavate any right-of-way, other than excavations necessary for emergency repairs, without first having provided the city with written notice of such activity. Such notice shall be provided to the office of the director of public works at least three days before the commencement of any such work. 
(b)  Grantee shall not at any one time open or encumber more of the right-of-way than shall be reasonably necessary to enable grantee to complete the project in the most expeditious manner. 
(c)  Grantee shall, in the performance of any work required for the installation, repair, maintenance, relocation and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all excavations to those excavations that are necessary for efficient operation. 
(d)  Grantee shall not permit such an excavation to remain open longer than is necessary to complete the repair or installation. 
(e)  Grantee shall notify the city no less than three working days in advance of any construction, reconstruction, repair, location or relocation of facilities which would require any street closure or which reduces traffic flow to less than two lanes of moving traffic for more than four hours. Except in the event of an emergency as reasonably determined by grantee, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the city. 
(f)  All work performed in the right-of-way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected at grantee's expense. Such signage shall be in conformance with the latest edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices. 
(g)  Grantee shall be liable for any damages to underground facilities due to excavation work prior to obtaining location of such facilities, or for any damage to underground facilities that have been properly identified prior to excavation. Grantee shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed underground facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities. 
(h)  Whenever there is an excavation by grantee that requires detouring, grantee shall be responsible for providing adequate detour traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by public works director of the city. Grantee shall perform work on the right-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. In the event the excavation is not completed in a reasonable period of time, grantee may be liable for actual damages to the city for delay caused by grantee. 
(i)  All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed and maintained by grantee shall be laid, constructed and maintained in accordance with acceptable engineering practice and in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Kansas, as well as the rules and regulations of the Kansas Corporation Commission or any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. 
(6)  Rights-of-way repair and restoration. All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossing, utilities, public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by grantee shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by grantee at its sole expense and the reasonable satisfaction of the city. Any excavation, back filling, repair and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with the city's design standards and specifications as promulgated by the public works director. The public works director has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require grantee to do the additional necessary work. At the time of any inspection, the public works director may order the immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well being of the public. Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be provided to grantee and a reasonable time not to exceed 15 days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected. 
(7)  Mapping of facilities. Grantee shall maintain and file with the city updated maps, in such form as may be required by the public works director, providing the location and sufficient detail of all existing and new facilities in the rights-of-way, and such other related information as may be reasonably required by the public works director of all users of the rights-of-way. Such maps shall be updated and kept current with the city. 
(8)  Advertising, signs or extraneous markings. Provider shall comply with city ordinances regarding the placement of signs, advertisements or other extraneous markings, whether relating to provider or any other person or entity on the public right-of-way. 
(9)  Tree protection. Provider shall comply with city ordinances and regulations regarding the cutting, trimming, and removal of trees. 
(10)  Exclusion of certain locations/facilities. Prior to its installation of any system facilities in the rights-of-way and within ten business days after grantee provides the city with its proposed plans for the facilities, the city may in its discretion designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-of-way to be excluded from use by grantee for its facilities, including but not limited to ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of the public works director do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the grantee's system facilities or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof or any other facility or location that in the reasonable judgment of the public works director is incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation. The public works director may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by grantee due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the grantee, the city will cooperate in good faith with provider to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for provider. 
(11)  Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of the franchise, whether by lapse of time, by agreement between the grantee and the city or by forfeiture thereof, the grantee shall remove, at its sole cost, from public property any and all of its facilities that are the subject of the franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed 90 days, and it shall be the duty of grantee immediately upon such removal to restore the right-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as required by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request of grantee, the city may allow underground facilities to be left in place when it is not practical or desirable to require removal. 
(12)  Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall, in its exercise of the public interest, request of the grantee the relocation or reinstallation of any of its facilities, grantee shall forthwith remove, relocate or reinstall any such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request and the cost of such relocation, removal or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of said provider. The determination of what is in the public interest shall lie within the sole discretion of the city. Grantee shall upon request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly issued building or moving permit of the city, and within 48 hours prior to the date upon which said person intends to exercise its rights under said permit, grantee shall thereupon temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit, and grantee may require such permit holder to make payment in advance for any expenses incurred by said grantee pursuant to said person's request. 
(13)  Grantee responsible for costs. The grantee shall be responsible for its costs that are directly associated with its installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use, and replacement of its facilities within the rights-of-way. Grantee shall be responsible for its own costs incurred removing or relocating its facilities when required by the city due to city requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes. 
(Ord. No. 6281, §§ 1, 2, 7-16-02) 
Sec. 15-19. - Operation and maintenance. 
(1)  Open books and records. Grantee shall cooperate with the grantor with respect to grantor's administration of this franchise.

The grantee shall not be required to maintain any books or records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years, except that financial records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the required franchise fee payments shall be kept for six years. Upon request, the grantor will treat designated information disclosed by grantee as confidential to the extent permissible under state and federal law. All such review of grantee's books and records shall be performed by an independent party if the city itself enters into the business as a competitor. 
(2)  Communications with regulatory agencies. Copies of all petitions, applications, communications, and reports submitted by grantee to the FCC, Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters directly affecting system operations shall be made available to grantor upon request. Copies of responses from the above regulatory agencies to grantee likewise shall be made available promptly to grantor upon request. If the city is specifically named in any such pleading or response, the city shall automatically be furnished a copy by grantee. 
(3)  Annual reports. 
(a)  Upon request, grantee shall make available to grantor, within 90 days of the end of each of the applicable grantee's fiscal years during the term of this franchise, the following:

(4)  Service contract and subscriber information. Grantee shall have authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms, and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this franchise ordinance and to assure uninterrupted service to all of its subscribers; provided such rules, regulations, terms, and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this franchise, federal, state and/or local law, or any applicable rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 6281, §§ 1, 2, 7-16-02) 
Sec. 15-20. - Remedies, procedures and due process. 
(1)  Administration of franchise. The city shall be responsible for the continued administration of this franchise ordinance. The city may delegate this authority from time to time in any manner consistent with applicable law, provided, however, that the city shall not delegate enforcement authority. 
(2)  Nonenforcement by the city. Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this franchise ordinance by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. 
(3)  Remedies and enforcement procedure. 
(a)  Whenever the city has reason to believe that grantee has violated any provision of this franchise, the city shall first notify the grantee in writing of the nature of the violation with sufficient specificity to allow grantee to identify the provision of this agreement that has allegedly been violated, and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 30 days. If the grantee fails to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no violation exists, or if the grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if the grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than 30 days of a public hearing to be held before the city commission. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. This procedure shall apply to all alleged franchise violations, including those in which grounds for revocation are considered. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the city commission shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. 
(c)  In the event the city finds that the grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the city and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the city finds that the grantee has not corrected the alleged violation within the specified time nor taken steps to correct the violation, the city may impose liquidated damages, as follows: 
1.  For grantee's failure to comply with the service extension provisions of section 15-17(9), $500.00 per day of noncompliance; 
2.  For all other substantial violations of a material provision of the agreement, $250.00 per day per violation. No liquidated damages shall be imposed for grantee's failure to pay any sum of money due under this agreement nor for breach of customer service standards where the customer is otherwise compensated. 
3.  The city shall provide the grantee with written notice of its intent to impose liquidated damages together with a written finding of fact explaining the basis for such a decision. 
(e)  If the city elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute the city's exclusive remedy with respect to the alleged violations. 
(f)  In the event that the franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of the grantee, the performance bond provided pursuant to the franchise shall remain in effect and available to the city until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point the bond will be released. 
(g)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other rights of city, whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such performance bond shall affect any other right city may have. 
(h)  The foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to preclude the city from obtaining any other available remedies for repeated violations, of the same general type, whether remedied or not. 
(4)  Grounds for revocation. In addition to any rights in this franchise, grantor reserves the right to utilize the above described enforcement procedure to revoke this franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that any of the following occur, and the city and grantee are not able to mutually agree upon a cure or alternate remedy: 
(a)  Grantee substantially violates any material provision of this franchise; 
(b)  Grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the grantor; or 
(c)  Grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt. 
(5)  Right of appeal. 
(a)  Upon the imposition of a penalty or revocation decision, grantee shall have a period of 120 days subsequent to the date of the formal adoption of the decision by the governing body within which to file an appeal with the Riley County District Court.

(Ord. No. 6281, §§ 1, 2, 7-16-02) 
Sec. 15-21. - Foreclosure, receivership and abandonment. 
(1)  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of the system or upon the termination of any lease covering all or part of the cable system, grantee shall notify grantor of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this franchise governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
(2)  Receivership. Consistent with applicable law, grantor shall have the right to cancel this franchise 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless: 
(a)  Within 120 days after its election or appointment, the receiver or trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of this franchise ordinance and remedied all defaults thereunder; and 
(b)  Such receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, has executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this franchise ordinance.

Sec. 15-22. - Sale or transfer. 
(1)  Sale or transfer of franchise. 
(a)  Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of this franchise or cable system without the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to perform its obligations under this franchise. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness or for a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with grantee. 
(b)  The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or control of this franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this section: 
1.  The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of grantee's assets in the city; 
2.  The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interests in grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee; 
3.  The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership membership or other equity interest by grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee; and 
4.  Grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of grantee or the system to an unaffiliated entity so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee. The term "controlling interest" as used herein means majority equity ownership of grantee. 
(c)  A transfer solely for security purposes such as the grant of a mortgage or security interest, including the pledge or grant of a mortgage or security interest to lenders of grantee's assets, including but not limited to this franchise, such as in a transaction commonly known as an "initial public offering" shall not be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or control of this franchise or cable system and thus shall not require compliance with this section. 
(d)  In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of this franchise or cable system, the city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days after receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of the 120-day period.

Sec. 15-24. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(1)  Rate regulation. The city reserves the right to regulate rates for basic cable service and any other services offered over the cable system, to the extent permitted by federal or state law. Grantee shall be subject to the rate regulation provisions provided for herein, and those of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N. The city shall comply with the rules relating to cable rate regulation promulgated by the FCC at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N. 
(2)  Rights reserved to grantor. Upon either final nonappealable determination of nonrenewal or revocation of this franchise, grantor shall have discretion to permit grantee by mutual consent to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time agreed upon by the parties. Any such operation of the system by grantee shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this franchise, and shall provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. 
(3)  Publication of notices. All public notices or ordinances required to be published by law shall be published in the local newspaper of record as identified by the city. Grantee shall pay all costs for publication that may be required of this franchise ordinance and any amendments thereto. 
(4)  Severability. If any material section of this franchise is held by a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid or unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in effect or is held by a court or competent governmental authority to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such applicable laws, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this franchise, and, to the extent possible, such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. 
(5)  Force majeure. In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations or requirements of this franchise is prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. Such causes beyond grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor unrest or strikes, untimely delivery of equipment, inability of grantee to obtain, without cost, access to an individual's property, and inability of grantee to secure all necessary permits to utilize utility poles and conduit so long as grantee made all reasonable efforts to ensure that required equipment, parts, components, personnel and proprietary activity was ordered, hired, paid for, scheduled, checked, approved, and/or facilitated.

The company shall comply with the city's rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances that relate to permits, sidewalk and pavement cuts, utility location, construction coordination, screening, and other requirements on the use of the rights-of-way. Provided, however, that the company retains its right to oppose, challenge, or seek judicial review of, any such rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances proposed, adopted, or promulgated by the city, as provided by law.

(b)  Further, the company shall comply with the following: 
(1)  The company's use of the rights-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the city's use or occupation of the rights-of-way. Without limitation of its rights, the city expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested or granted in the city. The company shall coordinate the installation of its facilities in the rights-of-way in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city. Where installation is not otherwise regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement as defined in the city's design standards and specifications, available in the office of the public works director. 
(2)  The company shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. 
(3)  All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, public improvements, or improvements of any kind located within the rights-of-way damaged or removed by the company in its activities under this franchise shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the company without cost to the city to the reasonable satisfaction of the city; however, when such activity is a joint project of utilities or franchise holders, the expenses thereof shall be prorated among the participants, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the city pertaining thereto. Nothing in this franchise shall require the company to repair or replace any materials, trees, flowers, shrubs, landscaping or structures that interfere with the company's access to any of its facilities located in a utility easement. Any excavation, back filling, repair and restoration, and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be done in conformance with the city's design standards and specifications as promulgated by the public works director. The public works director has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the company to do the additional necessary work. At the time of any inspection, the public works director may order the immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public. Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be provided to the company and a reasonable time not to exceed 15 days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected. 
(4)  Except in the event of an emergency, as reasonably determined by the company, the company shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, resolutions, or ordinances now or hereinafter adopted or promulgated by the city relating to any construction, reconstruction, repair, or relocation of facilities which would require any street closure which reduces traffic flow. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception all work, including emergency work performed in the traveled way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected. 
(c)  The company shall maintain and file with the city updated maps, in such form as may be required by the public works director, providing the location and sufficient detail of all existing and new facilities in the rights-of-way, and such other related information as may be reasonably required by the public works director of all users of the rights-of-way. Such maps shall be updated and kept current with the city. 
(d)  Whenever the city shall, in its exercise of the public interest, request of the company the relocation or reinstallation of any of its facilities to accommodate a public project, company shall remove, relocate or reinstall any such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request, and the cost of such relocation, removal or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of the company. The company shall upon request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly issued building or moving permit of the city, and within 48 hours prior to the date upon which the person intends to exercise its rights under the permit, the company shall temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit, and the company may require such permit holder to make payment in advance for any expenses incurred by the company. 
(e)  The company shall be responsible for its costs that are directly associated with its installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use, and replacement of its facilities within the rights-of-way. The company shall be responsible for its own costs incurred removing or relocating its facilities when required by the city due to city requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes, as part of a public project. 
(f)  The company shall coordinate with the city on the design and placement of facilities in the rights-of-way during and for the design of public projects. At the request and sole expense of the company, the city may include design for facilities in the design of public projects. Upon request by the city and within the time period specified in the city's request, the company shall locate, remove, relocate, or adjust any facilities located in rights-of-way if reasonably necessary for a public project. Such location, removal, relocation, or adjustment for a particular public project shall be performed by the company without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to applicable city rules and regulations. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as soon as possible within the time set forth in any request by the city for such relocation or adjustment. If additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment becomes necessary as a result of inaccurate or mistaken information provided by the company or city, the party which provided such inaccurate or mistaken information shall be responsible for costs associated with such additional location, removal, relocation, or adjustment without expense to the other party. The city will use its best efforts to continue to provide a location in the rights-of-way for the company's facilities as part of a public project, provided that the company has cooperated promptly and fully with the city in the design of its facilities as part of the public project. 
(g)  The company shall not be responsible for the expenses of relocation to accommodate any new private development project initiated after the effective date of this franchise. The expenses attributable to such a project shall be the responsibility of the third party requesting, requiring, or using such project upon the request and appropriate documentation of the company. Before such expenses may be billed to the third party, the company shall be required to coordinate with the third party and the city on the design and construction to ensure that the work required is necessary and done in a cost effective manner. The company may require payment in advance of estimated costs of relocation prior to undertaking any work required to accommodate any new private development project initiated after the effective date of this franchise. 
(h)  The company shall take adequate measures to protect and defend its facilities in the rights-of-way from harm or damage. If the company fails to accurately locate facilities when requested, it shall have no claim for costs or damages against the city. The company shall be responsible to the city and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the company to perform any of its obligations under this franchise agreement. The above general provisions notwithstanding, the city and its authorized contractors shall take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations through Kansas One Call and exercising due caution when working near the company's facilities. 
(i)  At a minimum, and without limitation, the company shall comply with all building, electrical and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the city. The company shall comply with all technical and zoning standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of the facilities in the right-of-way, as required by present and future federal, state, and city laws and regulations, including but not limited to the most recent standards of the State of Kansas, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
(j)  The city encourages the conservation of the rights-of-way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this franchise prohibiting third party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the company shall permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all facilities constructed or erected by the company. 
(k)  The company shall comply with city ordinances and regulations regarding the cutting, trimming, and removal of trees upon and overhanging the rights-of-way. For routine trimming operations, customers shall be contacted at least one week in advance by either personal contact or by informational door hanger. The company shall perform line clearance work in accordance with its general terms and conditions, NESC 218, and regulations established under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.269.

The use of the right-of-way provision of this franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the city have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines which use the public rights-of-way or public property of the city, and do not have requirements on the use of the public ways substantially equivalent to the requirements of this franchise, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to Kansas Gas Service.

Sec. 15-82. - Grant. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to SBC Kansas, a telecommunications local exchange service provider providing local exchange service within the city, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to construct, maintain, and operate facilities along, across, upon and under the public right-of-way for the purpose of providing telecommunications services. Nothing in this franchise is intended to preclude the city from seeking or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from any subsidiary, affiliate or third party providing telecommunications services. 
(b)  This contract franchise ordinance shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the public right-of-way, and gives only the right to occupy public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated herein. 
(c)  This contract franchise ordinance does not provide SBC Kansas the right to provide "cable service" to the city and inhabitants thereof. For purposes of this ordinance, "cable service" is defined as the one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming or other programming services, and subscriber interaction, if any, which is required for the selection of such video programming or other programming service; but "cable service" does not include point to point, point to multipoint, and switched video services that SBC Kansas has historically offered or other similar services that SBC Kansas may in the future offer. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking, or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from any subsidiary, affiliate, or third party providing "cable services." SBC Kansas and city agree that nothing in this franchise is intended to authorize the city to seek from SBC Kansas nor to require SBC Kansas to obtain a franchise to offer "open video systems" as that term is used in section 653 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 573). SBC Kansas and city further agree, however, that this ordinance does not authorize SBC Kansas to offer "open video systems" without paying a franchise fee on the gross revenues of the system operator for the provision of cable service in lieu of a franchise fee, pursuant to and in the manner described in 47 U.S.C. 573(c)(2)(b) and without complying with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 573. 
(Ord. No. 6340, § 1, 6-17-03) 
Sec 15-83. - Term. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance shall be effective for a term of one year from the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance. Thereafter, this contract franchise ordinance will renew for one additional one year term, unless either party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the contract franchise ordinance prior to 180 days before the termination of the then current term. The term of this franchise shall be deemed a continuation of the franchise that became effective on July 1, 2003, and not a new franchise. The additional term provided for herein shall also be deemed a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the City or Grantee, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, upon any of the following events: Changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or grantee, including but not limited to the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to the grantee or the compensation to be received by the city hereunder. 
(c)  Amendments under this section, if any, shall be made by contract ordinance as prescribed by statute. The contract franchise ordinance shall remain in effect according to its terms pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
(Ord. No. 6340, § 1, 6-17-03; Ord. No. 6554, § 1, 7-11-06; Ord. No. 6711, § 1, 7-15-08) 
Sec. 15-84. - Compensation. 
(a)  In consideration of this contract franchise ordinance, SBC Kansas agrees to remit to the city a franchise fee of $1.20 per access line. Thereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of the contract franchise ordinance shall continue to be based on a sum equal to $1.20 per access line, unless the city notifies SBC Kansas at least 90 before the end of the calendar year, that it intends to switch to a gross receipts fee in the following calendar year. In the event the city elects compensation based on a gross receipts fee, nothing herein precludes the city from switching back to a access line fee provided the city notifies SBC Kansas at least 90 before the end of the calendar year. 
(b)  Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the city, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (l) and (m), as amended, may elect to adopt an increased access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the access line fee. 
(c)  The franchise fee shall be due and payable on a monthly basis within 45 calendar days after the end of the remittal period. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate. 
(d)  Franchise fee payments shall be accompanied by a 9K2 statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated on a quarterly basis. No acceptance by the city of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, as amended. 
(e)  The city or its designated representatives shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to SBC Kansas no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees. 
(f)  Within 60 days of the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance, SBC Kansas shall pay to the city a one-time application fee of $1,000.00. The parties agree that such fee reimburses the city for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this contract franchise ordinance. SBC Kansas shall additionally pay the publication costs of this ordinance. 
(g)  The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees, and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the city under K.S.A. 12-2001 and 17-1902, as amended. The franchise fee is compensation for use of the public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind. 
(h)  SBC Kansas shall remit a franchise fee to the city on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the city shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller telecommunications local exchange service provider and shall not require the reseller to enter a contract franchise ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 6340, § 1, 6-17-03) 
Sec. 15-85. - Use of public right-of-way. 
(a)  Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, SBC Kansas shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate poles; conduit; cable; switches and related appurtenances; and facilities along, across, upon, and under the public right-of-way. Such appurtenances and facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities. 
(b)  Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting SBC Kansas the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the public right-of-way. 
(c)  The authority of SBC Kansas to use and occupy the public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the public right-of-way provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require a competitive infrastructure provider to enter into a contract franchise ordinance. SBC Kansas shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations governing the use of public right-of-way. 
(d)  The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of public right-of-way by SBC Kansas due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following: 
(1)  The prohibition is based upon a recommendation by the city engineer, is related to public health, safety, and welfare and is nondiscriminatory among providers, including incumbent providers; 
(2)  SBC Kansas has rejected a reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory justification offered by the city for requiring an alternate method or alternate route that will result in neither unreasonable additional installation expense nor a diminution of service quality; 
(3)  The city reasonably determines, after affording the provider reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; or 
(4)  The specific portion of the public right-of-way for which SBC Kansas seeks use and occupancy is environmentally sensitive as defined by state or federal law or lies within a previously designated historic district as defined by local, state or federal law. 
(e)  If there is an emergency necessitating response work or repair, SBC Kansas may begin that repair or emergency response work or take any action required under the circumstances, provided that SBC Kansas notifies the city promptly after beginning the work and timely thereafter meets any permit or other requirement had there not been such an emergency. 
(f)  SBC Kansas shall repair all damage to the public right-of-way caused by the activities of SBC Kansas, or of any agent affiliate, employee, or subcontractor of SBC Kansas, while occupying, installing, repairing or maintaining facilities in a public right-of-way and to return the public right-of-way to its functional equivalence before the damage pursuant to the reasonable requirements and specifications of the city. If SBC Kansas fails to make the repairs required by the city, the city may affect those repairs and charge SBC Kansas the cost of those repairs. If the city incurs damages as a result of a violation of this subsection, then the city shall have a cause of action against SBC for violation of this subsection, and may recover its damages, including reasonable attorney fees, if SBC is found liable by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(g)  When requested by the city, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, SBC Kansas promptly shall remove its facilities from the public right-of-way or shall relocate or adjust its facilities within the public right-of-way at no cost to the city. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any request by the city for such relocation or adjustment. Any damages suffered by the city or its contractors as a result of SBC Kansas' failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities shall be borne by SBC Kansas. 
(h)  SBC Kansas shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the public right-of-way in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer.

The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon SBC Kansas. 
(j)  Except as may otherwise be provided by other applicable ordinances of the city, where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public right-of-way exist, SBC Kansas shall place aboveground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible. 
(k)  When SBC Kansas is allowed to place facilities above ground under this section, SBC Kansas may attach its facilities to an existing utility pole pursuant to a properly executed agreement with the pole owner provided; however, that any necessary replacement of the pole in order to accommodate the attachment shall be subject to the proper exercise of the city's police powers, and in no instance shall a franchisee erect a new pole within an existing aerial pole line absent the city's prior authorization. 
    Aboveground pedestals, vaults, or other aboveground facilities, may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to this section, and shall generally be located behind the sidewalk where feasible and shall be screened from public view. Facilities in rear lot easements shall be exempt from the screening requirements except when they are within 50 feet of a street or highway. 
    The underground requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the maintenance and repair of existing facilities, as determined by the city engineer. 
(l)  SBC Kansas shall take all reasonable measures necessary to maintain accurate as completed records in electronic format, of all facilities constructed, reconstructed, or relocated in the public right-of-way of arterial streets after the date hereof. Such facilities shall be horizontally and vertically located at least every 100 feet and at any other alignment change. All points of facilities shall be horizontally located from street centerline, or section or quarter section lines or corners. Vertical locations on all points of facilities shall consist of elevations in United States Geological Survey datum. SBC Kansas shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within right-of-way when requested by the city or its authorized agents for a public project. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of SBC Kansas without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(m)  Permission is hereby granted to SBC to trim trees upon any overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public places of said city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with SBC's facilities; all the said trimming shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, and/or city regulations.

Sec. 15-86. - Indemnity and hold harmless. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of SBC Kansas to take adequate measures to protect and defend its facilities in the public right-of-way from harm or damage. If SBC Kansas fails to accurately or timely locate facilities when requested, it has no claim for costs or damages against the city and its authorized contractors unless such party is responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The city and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near SBC Kansas' facilities. 
(b)  SBC Kansas shall indemnify and hold the city and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of the provider, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of the provider, or their respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining facilities in a public right-of-way. 
    The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If SBC Kansas and the city are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the city under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the city and SBC Kansas and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. 
    SBC Kansas or the city shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against SBC Kansas or the city related to or arising out of the SBC Kansas' activities in a public right-of-way.

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 6680, adopted Dec. 18, 2007, amended the Code by adding Art. X to Ch. 15. Inasmuch as there already exists an Art. X and the provisions of Ord. No. 6680 are similar, the editor has treated said ordinance as superseding Art. X, §§ 15-150-15-162, which derived from Ord. No. 6311, adopted Dec. 17, 2002. 

Sec. 15-150. - Rights granted. 
    Kansas State University is hereby granted the right to construct, maintain, and operate a cable television system in, through, and along the public rights-of-way of the City of Manhattan, Kansas. Such right shall be for the sole purpose of supplying cable television service to facilities owned and operated by Kansas State University. The phrase "cable television service" shall exclude other telecommunication services including, but not limited to, telephone and open video systems. Notwithstanding the fact that this franchise is related to the providing of cable television service, the city hereby declares that Kansas State University is not a "cable grantee" as that term is used in the Communications Act of 1934 and the Telecommunications Act of 1966, and that neither of such acts are applicable to the services provided under this article. 
(Ord. No. 6680, § 1, 12-18-07) 
Sec. 15-151. - Term of franchise. 
    The term of the franchise herein granted shall commence on January 1, 2008. Kansas State University shall accept and agree in writing to the terms and conditions set forth in this article. The term of this shall be five years from such date. 
(Ord. No. 6680, § 1, 12-18-07) 
Sec. 15-152. - Use of rights-of-way. 
(1)  Rights-of-way construction. Prior to commencing any construction within rights-of-way of the city, grantee must obtain all necessary permits and licenses required by federal, state, and city laws, ordinances and rules, and pay all associated fees. Grantee shall comply in full with any rights-of-way ordinance of the city, as such may be adopted and amended from time to time, and all other construction regulations of general applicability. In the event of a conflict between such rights-of-way ordinance and the provisions of this franchise, the more restrictive, as to the use of the rights-of-way, shall apply. Further, grantee shall comply with all other applicable laws, ordinances, and rules relating to the construction, operation, and maintenance of a cable television system. 
(2)  Compliance with laws. At a minimum, and without limitation, grantee shall adhere to all building, electrical, and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the city. The construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be effectuated by grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws, ordinances, and construction standards of the State of Kansas, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical Code, and the FCC to the extent applicable, as well as all other applicable laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances that may be modified or amended from time to time. All open connections on splitters, couplers, and other devices shall be properly terminated. 
(3)  No interference. Grantee's use of the rights-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the city's use or occupation of the rights-of-way. Without limitation of its rights, the city expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the city. Grantee shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner, which minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably determined by the city. Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement as defined in the city's design standards and specifications available in the office of the public works director. Grantee shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. To the extent that the city requires any other users of the rights-of-way to implement such plans, the grantee shall, prior to commencement of work in the rights-of-way, execute a resident-notification plan to notify residents affected by the proposed work. All construction and maintenance by grantee or its subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with industry standards. 
(4)  Protection of the public. 
(a)  Should grantee make or cause to be made any excavation in, upon, under, through, or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley, or other rights-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building, or other material during construction and/or the nighttime, grantee shall cause the same to be enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption. 
(b)  Whenever grantee shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk, alley, driveway approach or other rights-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the excavation until it is refilled as specified. 
(c)  Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector-type street shall be securely covered. The grantee assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing, and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. 
(5)  Excavations/street closures. 
(a)  Grantee shall not excavate any rights-of-way, other than excavations necessary for emergency repairs, without first having provided the city with written notice of such activity. Such notice shall be provided to the office of the director of public works at least three days before the commencement of any such work. 
(b)  Grantee shall not at any one time open or encumber more of the rights-of-way than shall be reasonably necessary to enable grantee to complete the project in the most expeditious manner.

(f)  All work performed in the rights-of-way or which in any way impacts vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be properly signed, barricaded, and otherwise protected at grantee's expense. Such signage shall be in conformance with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(g)  Grantee shall be liable for any damages to underground facilities due to excavation work done prior to obtaining information as to the location of such facilities, or for any damage to underground facilities that have been properly identified prior to excavation. Grantee shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed underground facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities. 
(h)  Whenever there is an excavation by grantee that requires detouring traffic, grantee shall be responsible for providing adequate detour traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by the public works director of the city.

(6)  Rights-of-way repair and restoration.

(7)  Mapping of facilities. Grantee shall maintain and file with the city updated maps, in such form as may be required by the public works director, providing the location and sufficient detail of all existing and new facilities in the rights-of-way, and such other related information as may be reasonably required by the public works director of all users of the rights-of-way. Such maps shall be updated and kept current with the city.

The public works director may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by grantee due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other limitations or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the grantee, the city will cooperate in good faith with grantee to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for grantee. 
(11)  Removal of facilities. Upon expiration of the franchise, whether by lapse of time, by agreement between the grantee and the city, or by forfeiture thereof, the grantee shall remove, at its sole cost, from public property any and all of its facilities that are the subject of the franchise within a reasonable time after such expiration, not to exceed 90 days, and, it shall be the duty of grantee immediately upon such removal to restore the rights-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good condition as the same were before the removal was effected and as required by the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request of grantee, the city may allow underground facilities to be left in place when it is not practical or desirable to require removal. 
(12)  Relocation of facilities. Whenever the city shall, in its exercise of the public interest, request of the grantee the relocation or reinstallation of any of its facilities, grantee shall forthwith remove, relocate or reinstall any such property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request and the cost of such relocation, removal, or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of said grantee. The determination of what is in the public interest shall lie within the sole discretion of the city. Grantee shall upon request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly issued building or moving permit of the city, and within 48 hours prior to the date upon which said person intends to exercise its rights under said permit, thereupon temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires or other facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit, and grantee may require such permit holder to make payment in advance for any expenses incurred by said grantee pursuant to said person's request. 
(13)  Grantee responsible for costs. The grantee shall be responsible for its costs that are directly associated with its installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use, and replacement of its facilities within the rights-of-way. Grantee shall be responsible for its own costs incurred removing or relocating its facilities when required by the city due to city requirements relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for city purposes.

Said interest to be applied commencing with the 60th day after the end of the fiscal quarter and continuing until all such overdue sums (including interest) are paid. 
    No acceptance of any payment shall be construed, as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this franchise. Upon request by the city, Kansas State University shall within a reasonable time submit to the city a detailed financial statement showing the gross revenues for any period of time applicable under this franchise agreement. The city shall be entitled to audit, examine and verify such financial statements and financial records of Kansas State University as necessary to substantiate franchise fees due.

If within 30 days after the effective date of said repealing ordinance Kansas State University shall not have instituted an action, either in the District Court of Riley County, Kansas, or some other court of competent jurisdiction to determine whether or not Kansas State University has violated the terms of this article and that the ordinance is subject to cancellation by reason thereof, this article shall be cancelled and terminated at the end of such 30-day period.

Sec. 15-171. - Grant. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider. This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to Wamego Telecom, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to locate, construct, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain, facilities along, across, upon and under the ROW for Wamego Telecom to lease, license, sell, or otherwise convey such facilities, or the capacity or bandwidth of such facilities, to third-party carriers to provide telecommunications services, internet services, or other intrastate or interstate traffic. 
(b)  Conveyance of title. This contract franchise ordinance shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the ROW, and gives only the right to occupy the ROW, for the purposes and for the period stated herein. 
(c)  Cable service or video service. This contract franchise ordinance does not provide Wamego Telecom the right to provide cable service or video service to the city and inhabitants thereof. If Wamego Telecom intends to provide cable service or video service within the corporate boundaries of the city, Wamego Telecom shall follow the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq., as amended, in providing notice, executing an agreement with the city per K.S.A. 12-2024, and paying a video service provider fee to the city. In the event that K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq. is repealed or amended in such a way as to provide direct franchising authority to the city, Wamego Telecom shall promptly notify the city of its intent to provide cable or video service and renegotiate this contract franchise ordinance in accordance with applicable law prior to providing such service. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking, or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from Wamego Telecom or any subsidiary, affiliate, or third party providing cable services, to the extent any such franchise is permitted under applicable law at the time such service commences. Wamego Telecom and the city agree that nothing in this franchise is intended to authorize the city to seek from Wamego Telecom, nor to require Wamego Telecom to obtain, a franchise to offer "open video systems" as that term is used in section 653 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 573). Wamego Telecom and the city further agree, however, that this article does not authorize Wamego Telecom to offer "open video systems" without paying a fee on the gross revenues of the system operator for the provision of cable service in lieu of a franchise fee, pursuant to and in the manner described in 47 U.S.C. 573(c)(2)(b) and without complying with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 573. 
(d)  [Applicability.] This contract franchise ordinance is subject to the terms and conditions of all applicable federal, state and local laws, existing now or in the future, and the parties shall comply with any such laws in the exercise of their rights and performance of their obligations under this contract franchise ordinance. 
(e)  [Authority.] The authority of Wamego Telecom to use and occupy the ROW shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Wamego Telecom shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations, in effect now or as may be adopted in the future, governing the use of ROW. 
(Ord. No. 7240, § 2, 9-6-16) 
Sec. 15-172. - Term. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance shall be effective for a term of five years from the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance. Thereafter, this contract franchise ordinance shall automatically renew for three additional five-year terms, unless a party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the contract franchise ordinance prior to 180 days before the termination of the current term. The additional terms are a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. But, in no event, shall the city be permitted to terminate Wamego Telecom's right under this agreement to place facilities in the ROW unless Wamego Telecom abandons all of the Network, or unless the terms of the agreement are breached and/or local, state, or federal law permit. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the city or Wamego Telecom, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or Wamego Telecom, including, but not limited to, the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to Wamego Telecom or the compensation to be received by the city. 
(c)  Amendments under this section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. The contract franchise ordinance shall remain in effect according to its terms pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
(Ord. No. 7240, § 3, 9-6-16) 
Sec. 15-173. - Compensation. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider franchise fee. In consideration of this contract franchise ordinance, WTC Technologies, Inc., agrees to pay the city the franchise fee of five percent of Wamego Telecom's gross revenue derived from its grant as a competitive infrastructure provider within the corporate boundaries of the city, including, but not limited to, any RF telecommunications service revenue and any other operating revenue derived from leasing, licensing, or otherwise selling or conveying the right to use Wamego Telecom's facilities, and indefeasible rights of use ("IRU") fees. Wamego Telecom shall pay its franchise fee on the 15th day of the second month following the month in which the gross revenue is collected. 
(b)  Wamego Telecom shall reimburse the city for the publication costs related to the adoption or amendment of this contract franchise ordinance. 
(c)  If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest shall accrue from the due date until received, at an annual rate of ten percent, or if lower, the highest percentage allowed by law. 
(d)  Wamego Telecom shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office in Wamego, KS, or such other location of its choosing, for the purpose of determining the amounts due to the city pursuant to this subsection. The city shall have access to, and the right to examine, at all reasonable times, all books, receipts, files, records and documents of Wamego Telecom necessary to verify the correctness of compensation paid to the city, and to correct the same, if found to be erroneous. The city may only exercise its right to examine the books, receipts, files, records, and documents one time per year at a mutually agreeable time. If the statement of fees paid by Wamego Telecom is incorrect, Wamego Telecom shall promptly make payment upon such corrected statement. The city agrees to hold in confidence any non-public information it learns from Wamego Telecom to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 7240, § 4, 9-6-16) 
Sec. 15-174. - Installation of the facilities. 
(a)  Pursuant to the grants provided herein, Wamego Telecom shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate the facilities along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting Wamego Telecom the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the ROW. 
(b)  Wamego Telecom shall construct and maintain the facilities in a skillful and workmanlike manner that does not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such ROW, and that does not obstruct or interfere with the legal use of the ROW by other utilities. Wamego Telecom shall be solely responsible for communicating with Kansas One-Call, or for taking other necessary measures to determine the location of public improvements or other facilities located in the ROW. Wamego Telecom shall install facilities in accordance with traffic control plans for temporary construction work that are approved by the city, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. Wamego Telecom shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the ROW in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer. 
(c)  Wamego Telecom shall be the city's point of contact and all communications shall be through Wamego Telecom. Wamego Telecom shall at all times maintain with the city a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Wamego Telecom in the event of an emergency. Wamego Telecom shall provide the city with the local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution adopted by the city, Wamego Telecom shall follow the following process for the installation of any facilities: 
(1)  Wamego Telecom shall submit to the city its plans and specifications for the installation of the facilities. Approval of plans and specifications and the issuance of any permits or approvals by the city shall not release Wamego Telecom from the responsibility for, or the correction of, any errors, omissions, or other mistakes that may be contained in the plans, specifications, or city permits or approvals. Wamego Telecom shall immediately notify the city and other relevant parties if Wamego Telecom discovers errors, omissions, or mistakes, and Wamego Telecom shall obtain any correct city approval, if necessary. 
(2)  The city shall approve plans and specifications that comply with the requirements of this article. The city must respond to the submission of such plans and specifications within 30 working days from the date of submission of a complete application with any applicable license application or fee. The location, aesthetic requirements, depth of the fiber underground, and any other requirements shall be approved by the city in writing prior to the installation of any facilities at a specific location, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of the ROW by Wamego Telecom due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare, so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following: 
a.  The prohibition is based upon a recommendation by the city engineer, is related to public health, safety, and welfare and is nondiscriminatory among providers, including incumbent providers; 
b.  Wamego Telecom has rejected a reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory justification offered by the city for requiring an alternate method or alternate route that will result in neither unreasonable additional installation expense nor a diminution of service quality; 
c.  The city reasonably determines, after affording Wamego Telecom reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; or 
d.

(Ord. No. 7103, § 1, 11-4-14) 
Sec. 15-191. - Grants. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider. This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to IdeaTek, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to locate, construct, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain, facilities along, across, upon and under the ROW for IdeaTek to lease, license, sell, or otherwise convey such facilities, or the capacity or bandwidth of such facilities, to third-party carriers to provide telecommunications services, internet services, or other intrastate or interstate traffic. 
(b)  Telecommunications service provider. This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to IdeaTek, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to locate, construct, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain, and operate facilities along, across, upon and under the ROW for IdeaTek to provide local exchange services and other telecommunications services to its customers within the city. 
(c)  Affiliate contract franchise. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from an affiliate or third party providing telecommunications services. 
(d)  Conveyance of title. This contract franchise ordinance shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the ROW, and gives only the right to occupy the ROW, for the purposes and for the period stated herein. 
(e)  Cable service. This contract franchise ordinance does not provide IdeaTek the right to provide cable service to the city and inhabitants thereof. If, during the term of this franchise, IdeaTek desires to provide cable service within the corporate boundaries of the city, IdeaTek shall follow the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq., as amended, in providing notice and paying a video service provider fee to the city. In the event that K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq. is repealed or amended in such a way as to provide direct franchising authority to the city, IdeaTek shall promptly notify the city of its intent to provide cable service and renegotiate this contract franchise ordinance in accordance with applicable law prior to providing such service. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking, or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from IdeaTek or any subsidiary, affiliate, or third party providing cable services, to the extent any such franchise is permitted under applicable law at the time such service commences. IdeaTek and the city agree that nothing in this franchise is intended to authorize the city to seek from IdeaTek, nor to require IdeaTek to obtain, a franchise to offer "open video systems" as that term is used in Section 653 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 573). IdeaTek and the city further agree, however, that this article does not authorize IdeaTek to offer "open video systems" without paying a fee on the gross revenues of the system operator for the provision of cable service in lieu of a franchise fee, pursuant to and in the manner described in 47 U.S.C. 573(c)(2)(b) and without complying with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 573. 
(f)  [Applicability.] This contract franchise ordinance is subject to the terms and conditions of all applicable federal, state and local laws, existing now or in the future, and the parties shall comply with any such laws in the exercise of their rights and performance of their obligations under this contract franchise ordinance. "Laws" means any and all statutes, constitutions, ordinances, resolutions, regulations, judicial decisions, rules, permits, approvals or other applicable requirements of the city or other governmental entity or agency having joint or several jurisdiction over any aspect of this contract franchise ordinance or the parties' activities hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter adopted, including, but not limited to, a city ROW management ordinance and the city's zoning and land use laws to the extent they are not inconsistent with state and federal law regulating use of the ROW, and any related laws, rules, or regulations and amendments thereto relating to the use and occupancy of the ROW. 
(g)  [Authority to use ROW.] The authority of IdeaTek to use and occupy the ROW shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. IdeaTek shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations, in effect now or as may be adopted in the future, governing the use of ROW. 
(Ord. No. 7103, § 2, 11-4-14) 
Sec. 15-192. - Definitions. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance shall be effective for a term of five years from the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance. Thereafter, this contract franchise ordinance shall automatically renew for three additional five-year terms, unless a party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the contract franchise ordinance prior to 180 days before the termination of the current term. The additional terms are a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. But, in no event, shall the city be permitted to terminate IdeaTek's right under this agreement to place facilities in the ROW unless IdeaTek abandons all of the network, or unless the terms of the agreement are breached and/or local, state, or federal law permit. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the city or IdeaTek, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or IdeaTek, including, but not limited to, the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to the IdeaTek or the compensation to be received by the city.

This fee shall be credited toward other city permit fees that exist as of the date the DAS facility is installed that relate to the installation of the DAS facility. IdeaTek shall pay the one-time permit and license fee upon submission of a complete application for the installation of a DAS facility per this article and after the date of IdeaTek's submission of a complete application, the city shall not retroactively apply any new permit or licensing fees to the DAS facility.

The city may only exercise its right to examine the books, receipts, files, records, and documents one time per year at a mutually agreeable time. If the statement of fees paid by IdeaTek is incorrect, IdeaTek shall promptly make payment upon such corrected statement. The city agrees to hold in confidence any non-public information it learns from IdeaTek to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 7103, § 4, 11-4-14) 
Sec. 15-194. - Installation of the facilities. 
(a)  Pursuant to the grants provided herein, IdeaTek shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate the facilities along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting IdeaTek the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the ROW. 
(b)  IdeaTek shall construct and maintain the facilities in a skillful and workmanlike manner that does not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such ROW, and that does not obstruct or interfere with the legal use of the ROW by other utilities. IdeaTek shall be solely responsible for communicating with Kansas One-Call, or for taking other necessary measures to determine the location of public improvements or other facilities located in the ROW. IdeaTek shall install facilities in accordance with traffic control plans for temporary construction work that are approved by the city, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. IdeaTek shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the ROW in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer. 
(c)  IdeaTek shall be the city's point of contact and all communications shall be through IdeaTek. IdeaTek shall at all times maintain with the city a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of IdeaTek in the event of an emergency. IdeaTek shall provide the city with the local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution adopted by the city, IdeaTek shall follow the following process: 
(1)  IdeaTek shall submit to the city its plans and specifications for the installation of the facilities. Approval of plans and specifications and the issuance of any permits or approvals by the city shall not release IdeaTek from the responsibility for, or the correction of, any errors, omissions, or other mistakes that may be contained in the plans, specifications, or city permits or approvals. IdeaTek shall immediately notify the city and other relevant parties if IdeaTek discovers errors, omissions, or mistakes, and IdeaTek shall obtain any correct city approval, if necessary. 
(2)  The city shall approve plans and specifications that comply with the requirements of this article. The city must respond to the submission of such plans and specifications within 15 working days from the date of submission of a complete application with the DAS facility permit and license fee. The location, aesthetic requirements, depth of the fiber underground, and any other requirements shall be approved by the city in writing prior to the instillation of any facilities at a specific location, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of the ROW by IdeaTek due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare, so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following: 
a.  The prohibition is based upon a recommendation by the city engineer, is related to public health, safety, and welfare and is nondiscriminatory among providers, including incumbent providers; 
b.  IdeaTek has rejected a reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory justification offered by the city for requiring an alternate method or alternate route that will result in neither unreasonable additional installation expense nor a diminution of service quality; 
c.  The city reasonably determines, after affording IdeaTek reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; or 
d.  The specific portion of the ROW for which IdeaTek seeks use and occupancy is environmentally sensitive as defined by state or federal law or lies within a previously designated (as of the date of submission of the DAS facility permit application) historic district as defined by local, state or federal law. 
(e)  IdeaTek shall cooperate with the city and follow all legally binding city policies and state and local ordinances with respect to aesthetics. 
(f)  In addition to the approvals required by this section, IdeaTek must obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, and any other authorization or approval required by the city (collectively, the "permits and approvals") relating to the installation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities or network and for the use and occupancy of the ROW, including but not limited to all permits and approvals required under a city ROW ordinance or zoning regulation and that are not inconsistent with state and federal laws regarding the regulation of the public ROW. The city shall process each valid and administratively complete application for requested permits and approvals in accordance with the time requirements of applicable laws, and shall not unreasonably or unlawfully withhold or delay any permits and approvals. IdeaTek shall comply with any condition or requirement set forth in any permit and approval, if they comply with the laws. 
(g)  Except as may otherwise be provided by this article, where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public ROW exists, IdeaTek shall place all facilities underground, and/or replace all above-ground facilities with underground facilities, in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city, provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible as determined by both parties. Above-ground pedestals, vaults, or other above-ground facilities, may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not technically or financially feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to this section, and shall generally be located behind the sidewalk where feasible and shall be screened from public view. The underground requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the maintenance and repair of existing facilities, as determined by the city engineer. 
(h)  When IdeaTek is allowed to place DAS facilities above ground under this section, IdeaTek may attach its DAS facilities to an existing utility pole pursuant to a properly executed agreement with the pole owner provided. If IdeaTek locates on an existing utility pole owned by the city, IdeaTek shall be responsible for all costs to install and maintain a separate utility meter, and shall pay the electric costs related to its facilities on the city pole. IdeaTek agrees that in areas where there are existing poles, IdeaTek will work with the owner of that existing pole to collocate DAS facilities, but only when the pole owner is willing to allow such attachment and where such attachment is feasible from a safety, technical, and engineering (structural and radio frequency coverage) perspective. Any necessary replacement of any pole to accommodate the attachment shall be subject to the proper exercise of the city's police powers, and in no instance shall IdeaTek erect a new pole within an existing aerial pole line absent the city's prior authorization. IdeaTek may build new poles or other similar facilities required for the installation of the facilities which would comply with all encroachment and building permits, applicable city, state and federal specifications, and this article. IdeaTek hereby grants the city the right to use any new poles for city purposes, including, but not limited to, streetlights and other lighting, so long as such use does not interfere with IdeaTek's use of its facilities. IdeaTek shall reasonably cooperate with the city in the city's use of the new poles The city shall not be required to pay a fee to use IdeaTek's poles for a city purpose, except that IdeaTek may require the city to separately meter and pay for any city electrical use of IdeaTek's pole. Except for the installation of the lights and ancillary equipment on or in the new poles and/or as set forth in subsection (j) below, IdeaTek shall not be responsible for maintenance, repair, or replacement of city-owned lights, light bulbs and equipment or equipment owned by third parties authorized by the city on the new poles. 
(i)  If IdeaTek's pole falls or is damaged such that there is an imminent threat of harm to persons or property, then the city may cause the pole to be removed to the side of the street or a location that city believes reasonably eliminates the risk of such imminent threat of harm to persons or property. IdeaTek shall, after written notice from the city that its pole has been damaged or removed, cause its pole to be removed, repaired or replaced within 30 days after the city's written notice. The cost to remove, repair or replace IdeaTek's pole, including the replacement city streetlight, bulb and ancillary equipment, shall be paid by IdeaTek; provided, however, that if IdeaTek's pole is damaged or destroyed by the city or a third party user that the city has given the right to use the pole, then the city and/or its third party user shall pay the cost to repair and/or replace the pole. To the extent that IdeaTek seeks reimbursement from a third party either directly or through applicable insurance, the city shall assign to IdeaTek any rights the city may have against such third party for such claim. 
(j)  If there is an emergency necessitating response work or repair, IdeaTek may begin that repair or emergency response work or take any action required under the circumstances, provided that IdeaTek notifies the city promptly after beginning the work and timely thereafter meets any permit or other requirement had there not been such an emergency. 
(k)  In granting this contract franchise ordinance, the city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of the ROW. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon IdeaTek. 
(l)  IdeaTek shall take all reasonable measures necessary to maintain accurate as completed records in electronic format, of all facilities constructed, reconstructed, or relocated in the ROW. IdeaTek shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the ROW when requested by the city or its authorized agents for a public project. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of IdeaTek without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(m)  IdeaTek may trim trees overhanging the ROW that may come into contact with IdeaTek facilities with the prior approval of the city's forester.

(d)  To protect or preserve the public health, safety and welfare. 
    The city shall cooperate with IdeaTek in relocating any portion of the network removed pursuant to this section in a manner that allows IdeaTek to continue providing service to its customers, including, but not limited to, expediting approval of any necessary permits and approvals required for the relocation of that portion of the relocated network. The city may not charge permitting or other fees for a removal occurring under this section. Any damages suffered by the city or its contractors as a result of IdeaTek's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities shall be borne by IdeaTek. The parties understand and agree that neither the city nor IdeaTek is entitled to compensation for any relocation of the IdeaTek network that may be required by this section. IdeaTek acknowledges that it is not entitled to relocation assistance or any other compensation or benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act or any other applicable provision of law upon termination of this contract franchise ordinance.

    IdeaTek agrees that it will be solely responsible for the payment of any and all applicable taxes, fees and assessments levied on its ownership, use and maintenance of the network and this contract franchise ordinance. Pursuant to Section 79-5(a)(26) of the Kansas Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended, the city hereby advises, and IdeaTek recognizes and understands, that IdeaTek's use of the ROW and/or IdeaTek facilities may create a possessory interest subject to real property taxation and that IdeaTek may be subject to, and responsible for, the payment of real property taxes levied on such interest.

Sec. 15-204. - Default; abandonment; expiration or termination of contract franchise. 
(a)  A "default" shall be deemed to have occurred if a party fails to cure a breach, within 30 days after written notice specifying such breach, provided that if the breach is of a nature that it cannot be cured within 30 days, a default shall not have occurred so long as the breaching party has commenced to cure within said time period and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion. 
(b)  Upon a party's failure to timely cure a breach after city notice, and upon expiration of the above cure periods, then the other party may terminate this contract franchise and pursue all remedies provided for in this contract franchise and/or any remedies it may have under applicable law or principles of equity relating to such breach. 
    In addition to the remedies set forth herein, the city shall have the right to terminate this contract franchise if (i) the city is mandated by law, a court order or decision, or the federal or state government to take certain actions that will cause or require the removal of the facilities from the ROW; or (ii) if IdeaTek's licenses are terminated, revoked, expired, or otherwise abandoned. Such termination rights under subsection (i) shall be subject to IdeaTek's rights to just compensation, if any, from the federal, state or local government requiring such removal for any taking of a protected property right. 
(c)  In the event IdeaTek ceases to operate and abandons the network, any facility, or parts thereof, for a period of 90 days or more, IdeaTek shall, at its sole cost and expense and within 90 days from the date of abandonment, vacate and remove the network or the abandoned part thereof. If such removal disturbs the facility or adjacent property (including ROW or city real property), IdeaTek shall also, at its sole cost and expense, restore or repair the ROW, each facility, and any adjacent property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and further excepting landscaping and related irrigation equipment or other aesthetic improvements made by IdeaTek to the facility or adjacent property. Alternatively, the city may allow IdeaTek, in the city's sole and absolute discretion, to abandon the network, or any part thereof, in place and convey it to the city. 
(d)  Upon expiration or termination of this contract franchise for any reason, IdeaTek shall have the right to remove any and all of its facilities within 60 days after such termination or expiration, or to transfer any and all of its facilities to another entity authorized to place facilities in the ROW. IdeaTek has the duty, immediately upon any such removal, to restore the ROW from which the facilities are removed to as good a condition as the same were before removal was performed. If IdeaTek fails to remove or transfer its facilities within 60 days, the city may, at its option, remove any or all of the facilities at IdeaTek's expense, or take ownership of any or all of facilities for the city's use and/or disposal. 
(Ord. No. 7103, § 15, 11-4-14) 
Sec. 15-205. - Notices.

(Ord. No. 7196, § 2, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 15-221. - Grant. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider. This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to Kansas Fiber, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to locate, construct, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain, facilities along, across, upon and under the ROW for Kansas Fiber to lease, license, sell, or otherwise convey such facilities, or the capacity or bandwidth of such facilities, to third-party carriers to provide telecommunications services, internet services, or other intrastate or interstate traffic. 
(b)  Affiliate contract franchise. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from an affiliate or third party providing telecommunications services. 
(c)  Conveyance of title. This contract franchise ordinance shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the ROW, and gives only the right to occupy the ROW, for the purposes and for the period stated herein. 
(d)  Cable service. This contract franchise ordinance does not provide Kansas Fiber the right to provide cable service to the city and inhabitants thereof. If, during the term of this franchise, Kansas Fiber desires to provide cable service within the corporate boundaries of the city, Kansas Fiber shall follow the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq., as amended, in providing notice and paying a video service provider fee to the city. In the event that K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq. is repealed or amended in such a way as to provide direct franchising authority to the city, Kansas Fiber shall promptly notify the city of its intent to provide cable service and renegotiate this contract franchise ordinance in accordance with applicable law prior to providing such service. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance is intended to preclude the city from seeking, or authorize the city to seek, a franchise from Kansas Fiber or any subsidiary, affiliate, or third party providing cable services, to the extent any such franchise is permitted under applicable law at the time such service commences. Kansas Fiber and the city agree that nothing in this franchise is intended to authorize the city to seek from Kansas Fiber, nor to require Kansas Fiber to obtain, a franchise to offer "open video systems" as that term is used in section 653 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 573). Kansas Fiber and the city further agree, however, that this article does not authorize Kansas Fiber to offer "open video systems" without paying a fee on the gross revenues of the system operator for the provision of cable service in lieu of a franchise fee, pursuant to and in the manner described in 47 U.S.C. 573(c)(2)(b) and without complying with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 573. 
(e)  This contract franchise ordinance is subject to the terms and conditions of all applicable federal, state and local laws, existing now or in the future, and the parties shall comply with any such laws in the exercise of their rights and performance of their obligations under this contract franchise ordinance. 
(f)  The authority of Kansas Fiber to use and occupy the ROW shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Kansas Fiber shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations, in effect now or as may be adopted in the future, governing the use of ROW. 
(Ord. No. 7196, § 3, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 15-222. - Term. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance shall be effective for a term of five years from the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance. Thereafter, this contract franchise ordinance shall automatically renew for three additional five-year terms, unless a party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the contract franchise ordinance prior to 180 days before the termination of the current term. The additional terms are a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. But, in no event, shall the city be permitted to terminate Kansas Fiber's right under this agreement to place facilities in the ROW unless Kansas Fiber abandons all of the network, or unless the terms of the agreement are breached and/or local, state, or federal law permit. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the city or Kansas Fiber, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or Kansas Fiber, including, but not limited to, the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to Kansas Fiber or the compensation to be received by the city. 
(c)  Amendments under this section, if any, shall be made by contract franchise ordinance as prescribed by statute. The contract franchise ordinance shall remain in effect according to its terms pending completion of any review or renegotiation provided by this section. 
(Ord. No. 7196, § 4, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 15-223. - Compensation. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider franchise fee. In consideration of this contract franchise ordinance, Kansas Fiber agrees to pay the city the franchise fee of five percent of Kansas Fiber's gross revenue derived from its grant as a competitive infrastructure provider within the corporate boundaries of the city, including, but not limited to, RF telecommunications service revenue and any other operating revenue derived from leasing, licensing, or otherwise selling or conveying the right to use Kansas Fiber's facilities, and indefeasible rights of use ("IRU") fees. Kansas Fiber shall pay its franchise fee on the 15 th day of the second month following the month in which the gross revenue is received. 
(b)  Kansas Fiber shall reimburse the city for the publication costs related to the adoption or amendment of this contract franchise ordinance. 
(c)  If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest shall accrue from the due date until received, at an annual rate of ten percent, or if lower, the highest percentage allowed by law. 
(d)  Kansas Fiber shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office in Wichita, Kansas, or such other location of its choosing, for the purpose of determining the amounts due to the city pursuant to this subsection. The city shall have access to, and the right to examine, at all reasonable times, all books, receipts, files, records and documents of Kansas Fiber necessary to verify the correctness of compensation paid to the city, and to correct the same, if found to be erroneous. The city may only exercise its right to examine the books, receipts, files, records, and documents one time per year at a mutually agreeable time. If the statement of fees paid by Kansas Fiber is incorrect, Kansas Fiber shall promptly make payment upon such corrected statement. The city agrees to hold in confidence any non-public information it learns from Kansas Fiber to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 7196, § 5, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 15-224. - Installation of the facilities. 
(a)  Pursuant to the grants provided herein, Kansas Fiber shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate the facilities along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting Kansas Fiber the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the ROW. 
(b)  Kansas Fiber shall construct and maintain the facilities in a skillful and workmanlike manner that does not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such ROW, and that does not obstruct or interfere with the legal use of the ROW by other utilities. Kansas Fiber shall be solely responsible for communicating with Kansas One-Call, or for taking other necessary measures to determine the location of public improvements or other facilities located in the ROW. Kansas Fiber shall install facilities in accordance with traffic control plans for temporary construction work that are approved by the city, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. Kansas Fiber shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the ROW in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer. 
(c)  Kansas Fiber shall be the city's point of contact and all communications shall be through Kansas Fiber. Kansas Fiber shall at all times maintain with the city a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Kansas Fiber in the event of an emergency. Kansas Fiber shall provide the city with the local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution adopted by the city, Kansas Fiber shall follow the following process for the installation of any facilities: 
(1)  Kansas Fiber shall submit to the city its plans and specifications for the installation of the facilities. Approval of plans and specifications and the issuance of any permits or approvals by the city shall not release Kansas Fiber from the responsibility for, or the correction of, any errors, omissions, or other mistakes that may be contained in the plans, specifications, or city permits or approvals. Kansas Fiber shall immediately notify the city and other relevant parties if Kansas Fiber discovers errors, omissions, or mistakes, and Kansas Fiber shall obtain any correct city approval, if necessary. 
(2)  The city shall approve plans and specifications that comply with the requirements of this article. The city must respond to the submission of such plans and specifications within 30 working days from the date of submission of a complete application with any applicable license application or fee. The location, aesthetic requirements, depth of the fiber underground, and any other requirements shall be approved by the city in writing prior to the installation of any facilities at a specific location, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of the ROW by Kansas Fiber due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare, so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following: 
a.  The prohibition is based upon a recommendation by the city engineer, is related to public health, safety, and welfare and is nondiscriminatory among providers, including incumbent providers; 
b.  Kansas Fiber has rejected a reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory justification offered by the city for requiring an alternate method or alternate route that will result in neither unreasonable additional installation expense nor a diminution of service quality; 
c.  The city reasonably determines, after affording Kansas Fiber reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; or 
d.  The specific portion of the ROW for which Kansas Fiber seeks use and occupancy is environmentally sensitive as defined by state or federal law or lies within a previously designated (as of the date of submission of the facility plans) historic district as defined by local, state or federal law. 
(e)  Kansas Fiber shall cooperate with the city and follow all legally binding city policies and state and local ordinances with respect to aesthetics. 
(f)  In addition to the approvals required by this section, Kansas Fiber must obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, and any other authorization or approval required by the city (collectively, the "permits and approvals") relating to the installation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities or network and for the use and occupancy of the ROW, including, but not limited to, all permits and approvals required under a city ROW ordinance or zoning regulation and that are not inconsistent with state and federal laws regarding the regulation of the public ROW. The city shall process each valid and administratively complete application for requested permits and approvals in accordance with the time requirements of applicable laws, and shall not unreasonably or unlawfully withhold or delay any permits and approvals. Kansas Fiber shall comply with any condition or requirement set forth in any permit and approval, if they comply with the laws. 
(g)  Except as may otherwise be provided by this article, where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public ROW exists, Kansas Fiber shall place all facilities underground, and/or replace all above-ground facilities with underground facilities, in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city, provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible as determined by both parties. Above-ground pedestals, vaults, or other above-ground facilities, may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not technically or financially feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to this section, and shall generally be located behind the sidewalk where feasible and shall be screened from public view. The underground requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the maintenance and repair of existing facilities, as determined by the city engineer. 
(h)  If there is an emergency necessitating response work or repair, Kansas Fiber may begin that repair or emergency response work or take any action required under the circumstances, provided that Kansas Fiber notifies the city promptly after beginning the work and timely thereafter meets any permit or other requirement had there not been such an emergency. 
(i)  In granting this contract franchise ordinance, the city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of the ROW. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon Kansas Fiber. 
(j)  Kansas Fiber shall take all reasonable measures necessary to maintain accurate as completed records in electronic format, of all facilities constructed, reconstructed, or relocated in the ROW. Kansas Fiber shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the ROW when requested by the city or its authorized agents for a public project. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of Kansas Fiber without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors.

Sec. 15-225. - Removal of facilities due to public project and other causes. 
    Upon receipt of a written demand from the city, Kansas Fiber, at its sole cost and expense, shall remove and relocate any part of the network constructed, installed, used and/or maintained by Kansas Fiber under this contract franchise ordinance, within the reasonable time frame set forth by the city, whenever the city reasonably determines that the removal and/or relocation of any Kansas Fiber facility is needed for any of the following purposes: 
(a)  Due to any work proposed to be done by or on behalf of the city or any other governmental agency, including, but not limited to, any change of grade, alignment or width of any street, sidewalk or other public facility, installation of curbs, gutters or landscaping and installation, construction, maintenance or operation of any underground or aboveground facilities such as sewers, water mains, drains, storm drains, pipes, gas mains, poles, power lines, telephone lines, cable television lines and tracks; or, 
(b)  Because any part of the network or facility is interfering with or adversely affecting the proper operation of city-owned light poles, traffic signals, or other city facilities; or, 
(c)  Because the city is mandated by law, a court order or decision, or the federal or state government to take certain actions that will cause or require the removal of the facilities from the ROW; or, 
(d)  To protect or preserve the public health, safety and welfare. 
    The city shall cooperate with Kansas Fiber in relocating any portion of the network removed pursuant to this section in a manner that allows Kansas Fiber to continue providing service to its customers, including, but not limited to, expediting approval of any necessary permits and approvals required for the relocation of that portion of the relocated network. The city may not charge permitting or other fees for a removal occurring under this section. Any damages suffered by the city or its contractors as a result of Kansas Fiber's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities shall be borne by Kansas Fiber. The parties understand and agree that neither the city nor Kansas Fiber is entitled to compensation for any relocation of the Kansas Fiber network that may be required by this section. Kansas Fiber acknowledges that it is not entitled to relocation assistance or any other compensation or benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act or any other applicable provision of law upon termination of this contract franchise ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 7196, § 7, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 15-226. - Kansas Fiber and city access to the facilities. 
(a)  Kansas Fiber will be given reasonable access to each of the facilities in the ROW for the purposes of routine installation, repair, maintenance or removal of facilities. If any such activities have the potential to result in an interruption of the city's use of Kansas Fiber's new poles, Kansas Fiber shall provide the city with a minimum of three days' prior written notice of such activities. Such activities shall, to the extent feasible, be done with minimal impairment, interruption, or interference to city's use of Kansas Fiber's new poles. 
(b)  The city shall have commercially reasonable access to observe and inspect the facilities, and any work conducted by Kansas Fiber during the installation, maintenance and/or repairs of the facilities.

(b)  Kansas Fiber shall, at Kansas Fiber's sole cost and expense, perform all maintenance and repairs reasonably needed to maintain its facilities in good condition and neat and orderly appearance, and in compliance with all applicable laws. In the event any facility requires replacement because such part cannot be repaired, Kansas Fiber shall, at Kansas Fiber's sole cost and expense, replace the irreparable facility. Kansas Fiber shall not cause rubbish, garbage or debris on or around the facilities and shall not permit any rubbish, garbage or debris to accumulate on or around any enclosed areas around the facilities. If the city gives Kansas Fiber written notice of a failure by Kansas Fiber to maintain the facilities, Kansas Fiber shall use its best efforts to remedy such failure within 48 hours after receipt of such written notice. 
(c)  Kansas Fiber shall be responsible for any damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to street pavement, existing facilities and utilities, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, landscaping, and all other public or private facilities, to the extent caused by Kansas Fiber's construction, installation, maintenance, access, use, repair, replacement, relocation, or removal of facilities in the ROW. Kansas Fiber shall promptly repair such damage and restore the ROW and any affected adjacent property to a safe and satisfactory condition to the city in accordance with the city's applicable street or ROW restoration standards, or to the property owner if not the city. If Kansas Fiber fails to make the repairs required by the city, the city may affect those repairs and charge Kansas Fiber the cost of those repairs. If the city incurs damages as a result of a violation of this subsection, then the city shall have a cause of action against Kansas Fiber for violation of this section, and may recover its damages, including reasonable attorney fees, if Kansas Fiber is found liable by a court of competent jurisdiction. Kansas Fiber's obligations under this section shall survive for one year past the completion of such reparation and restoration work and return of the affected part of the ROW by Kansas Fiber to the city, or such longer period as may be established by the city's ROW ordinance, rules or regulations or other applicable laws.

Sec. 15-234. - Default; abandonment; expiration or termination of contract franchise. 
(a)  A "default" shall be deemed to have occurred if a party fails to cure a breach, within 30 days after written notice specifying such breach, provided that if the breach is of a nature that it cannot be cured within 30 days, a default shall not have occurred so long as the breaching party has commenced to cure within said time period and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion. 
(b)  Upon a party's failure to timely cure a breach after city notice, and upon expiration of the above cure periods, then the other party may terminate this contract franchise and pursue all remedies provided for in this contract franchise and/or any remedies it may have under applicable law or principles of equity relating to such breach. 
    In addition to the remedies set forth herein, the city shall have the right to terminate this contract franchise if (i) the city is mandated by law, a court order or decision, or the federal or state government to take certain actions that will cause or require the removal of the facilities from the ROW; or (ii) if Kansas Fiber's licenses are terminated, revoked, expired, or otherwise abandoned. Such termination rights under subsection (i) shall be subject to Kansas Fiber's rights to just compensation, if any, from the federal, state or local government requiring such removal for any taking of a protected property right. 
(c)  In the event Kansas Fiber ceases to operate and abandons the network, any facility, or parts thereof, for a period of 90 days or more, Kansas Fiber shall, at its sole cost and expense and within 90 days from the date of abandonment, vacate and remove the network or the abandoned part thereof. If such removal disturbs the facility or adjacent property (including ROW or city real property), Kansas Fiber shall also, at its sole cost and expense, restore or repair the ROW, each facility, and any adjacent property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and further excepting landscaping and related irrigation equipment or other aesthetic improvements made by Kansas Fiber to the facility or adjacent property. Alternatively, the city may allow Kansas Fiber, in the city's sole and absolute discretion, to abandon the network, or any part thereof, in place and convey it to the city. 
(d)  Upon expiration or termination of this contract franchise for any reason, Kansas Fiber shall have the right to remove any and all of its facilities within 60 days after such termination or expiration, or to transfer any and all of its facilities to another entity authorized to place facilities in the ROW. Kansas Fiber has the duty, immediately upon any such removal, to restore the ROW from which the facilities are removed to as good a condition as the same were before removal was performed. If Kansas Fiber fails to remove or transfer its facilities within 60 days, the city may, at its option, remove any or all of the facilities at Kansas Fiber's expense, or take ownership of any or all of facilities for the city's use and/or disposal. 
(Ord. No. 7196, § 16, 2-2-16)

Sec. 15-251. - Grant. 
(a)  Competitive infrastructure provider. This contract franchise ordinance hereby grants to Twin Valley, the nonexclusive contract, right, privilege, and franchise to locate, construct, place, attach, install, operate, use, control, repair, replace, upgrade, enhance and maintain, facilities along, across, upon and under the ROW for Twin Valley to lease, license, sell, or otherwise convey such facilities, or the capacity or bandwidth of such facilities, to third-party carriers to provide telecommunications services, internet services, or other intrastate or interstate traffic.

(c)  Cable service or video service. This contract franchise ordinance does not provide Twin Valley the right to provide cable service or video service to the city and inhabitants thereof. If Twin Valley intends to provide cable service or video service within the corporate boundaries of the city, Twin Valley shall follow the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2021, et seq., as amended, in providing notice, executing an agreement with the city per K.S.A. 12-2024, and paying a video service provider fee to the city.

(d)  This contract franchise ordinance is subject to the terms and conditions of all applicable federal, state and local laws, existing now or in the future, and the parties shall comply with any such laws in the exercise of their rights and performance of their obligations under this contract franchise ordinance. 
(e)  The authority of Twin Valley to use and occupy the ROW shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Twin Valley shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations, in effect now or as may be adopted in the future, governing the use of ROW. 
(Ord. No. 7329, § 3, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 15-252. - Term. 
(a)  This contract franchise ordinance shall be effective for a term of five years from the effective date of this contract franchise ordinance. Thereafter, this contract franchise ordinance shall automatically renew for three additional five-year terms, unless a party notifies the other party of its intent to terminate the contract franchise ordinance prior to 180 days before the termination of the current term. The additional terms are a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. But, in no event, shall the city be permitted to terminate Twin Valley's right under this agreement to place facilities in the ROW unless Twin Valley abandons all of the network, or unless the terms of the agreement are breached and/or local, state, or federal law permit. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the city or Twin Valley, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, upon any of the following events: changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or Twin Valley, including, but not limited to, the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to Twin Valley or the compensation to be received by the city.

In consideration of this contract franchise ordinance, Twin Valley Communications, Inc. agrees to pay the city the franchise fee of five percent of Twin Valley's gross revenue derived from its grant as a competitive infrastructure provider within the corporate boundaries of the city, including, but not limited to, any RF telecommunications service revenue and any other operating revenue derived from leasing, licensing, or otherwise selling or conveying the right to use Twin Valley's facilities, and indefeasible rights of use ("IRU") fees. Twin Valley shall pay its franchise fee on the 15th day of the second month following the month in which the gross revenue is collected. 
(b)  Twin Valley shall reimburse the city for the publication costs related to the adoption or amendment of this contract franchise ordinance. 
(c)  If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest shall accrue from the due date until received, at an annual rate of ten percent, or if lower, the highest percentage allowed by law. 
(d)  Twin Valley shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office in Wamego, Kansas, or such other location of its choosing, for the purpose of determining the amounts due to the city pursuant to this subsection.

Sec. 15-254. - Installation of the facilities. 
(a)  Pursuant to the grants provided herein, Twin Valley shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate the facilities along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting Twin Valley the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the ROW. 
(b)  Twin Valley shall construct and maintain the facilities in a skillful and workmanlike manner that does not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such ROW, and that does not obstruct or interfere with the legal use of the ROW by other utilities. Twin Valley shall be solely responsible for communicating with Kansas One-Call, or for taking other necessary measures to determine the location of public improvements or other facilities located in the ROW. Twin Valley shall install facilities in accordance with traffic control plans for temporary construction work that are approved by the city, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. Twin Valley shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the ROW in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer. 
(c)  Twin Valley shall be the city's point of contact and all communications shall be through Twin Valley. Twin Valley shall at all times maintain with the city a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of Twin Valley in the event of an emergency. Twin Valley shall provide the city with the local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution adopted by the city, Twin Valley shall follow the following process for the installation of any facilities: 
(1)  Twin Valley shall submit to the city its plans and specifications for the installation of the facilities. Approval of plans and specifications and the issuance of any permits or approvals by the city shall not release Twin Valley from the responsibility for, or the correction of, any errors, omissions, or other mistakes that may be contained in the plans, specifications, or city permits or approvals. Twin Valley shall immediately notify the city and other relevant parties if Twin Valley discovers errors, omissions, or mistakes, and Twin Valley shall obtain any correct city approval, if necessary. 
(2)  The city shall approve plans and specifications that comply with the requirements of this article. The city must respond to the submission of such plans and specifications within 30 working days from the date of submission of a complete application with any applicable license application or fee. The location, aesthetic requirements, depth of the fiber underground, and any other requirements shall be approved by the city in writing prior to the installation of any facilities at a specific location, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of the ROW by Twin Valley due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare, so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following:

(c)  Conveyance of title. This contract franchise ordinance shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the ROW, and gives only the right to occupy the ROW, for the purposes and for the period stated herein.

(f)  The authority of ExteNet to use and occupy the ROW shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety, and welfare requirements and regulations of the city. The city may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the ROW provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. ExteNet shall comply with all laws and lawful city regulations, in effect now or as may be adopted in the future, governing the use of ROW.

The additional terms are a continuation of this franchise and not a new franchise or amendment. But, in no event, shall the city be permitted to terminate ExteNet's right under this agreement to place facilities in the ROW unless ExteNet abandons all of the Network, or unless the terms of the agreement are breached and/or local, state, or federal law permit. 
(b)  Upon written request of either the city or ExteNet, this contract franchise ordinance shall be renegotiated at any time in accordance with the requirements of K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902, as amended, upon any of the following events: Changes in federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or orders that materially affect any rights or obligations of either the city or ExteNet, including, but not limited to, the scope of the contract franchise ordinance granted to ExteNet or the compensation to be received by the city.

ExteNet shall pay the one-time permit and license fee upon submission of a complete application for the installation of a DAS or small wireless facility per this article and after the date of ExteNet's submission of a complete application, the city shall not retroactively apply any new permit or licensing fees to the DAS or small wireless facility. 
(c)  [Reimbursement to the city.] ExteNet shall reimburse the city for the publication costs related to the adoption or amendment of this contract franchise ordinance. 
(d)  [Interest accrual for late fee.] If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest shall accrue from the due date until received, at an annual rate of ten percent, or if lower, the highest percentage allowed by law. 
(e)  [Recordkeeping.] ExteNet shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office in Lisle, Illinois, or such other location of its choosing, for the purpose of determining the amounts due to the city pursuant to this subsection. The city shall have access to, and the right to examine, at all reasonable times, all books, receipts, files, records and documents of ExteNet necessary to verify the correctness of compensation paid to the city, and to correct the same, if found to be erroneous. The city may only exercise its right to examine the books, receipts, files, records, and documents one time per year at a mutually agreeable time. If the statement of fees paid by ExteNet is incorrect, ExteNet shall promptly make payment upon such corrected statement. The city agrees to hold in confidence any non-public information it learns from ExteNet to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Sec. 15-316. - Installation of the facilities. 
(a)  Pursuant to the grants provided herein, ExteNet shall have the right to construct, maintain, and operate the facilities along, across, upon, and under the ROW. Nothing in this contract franchise ordinance shall be interpreted as granting ExteNet the authority to construct, maintain or operate any facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the city outside of the ROW. 
(b)  ExteNet shall construct and maintain the facilities in a skillful and workmanlike manner that does not obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such ROW, and that does not obstruct or interfere with the legal use of the ROW by other utilities. ExteNet shall be solely responsible for communicating with Kansas One-Call, or for taking other necessary measures to determine the location of public improvements or other facilities located in the ROW. ExteNet shall install facilities in accordance with traffic control plans for temporary construction work that are approved by the city, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. ExteNet shall coordinate the placement of its facilities in the ROW in a manner that minimizes adverse impact on public improvements, as reasonably determined by the city engineer. 
(c)  ExteNet shall be the city's point of contact and all communications shall be through ExteNet. ExteNet shall at all times maintain with the city a local point of contact who shall be available at all times to act on behalf of ExteNet in the event of an emergency. ExteNet shall provide the city with the local contact's name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution adopted by the city, ExteNet shall follow the following process: 
(1)  ExteNet shall submit to the city its plans and specifications for the installation of the facilities. Approval of plans and specifications and the issuance of any permits or approvals by the city shall not release ExteNet from the responsibility for, or the correction of, any errors, omissions, or other mistakes that may be contained in the plans, specifications, or city permits or approvals. ExteNet shall immediately notify the city and other relevant parties if ExteNet discovers errors, omissions, or mistakes, and ExteNet shall obtain any correct city approval, if necessary. 
(2)  The city shall approve plans and specifications that comply with the requirements of this article. The city must respond to the submission of such plans and specifications within 15 working days from the date of submission of a complete application with the DAS or small wireless facility permit and license fee. The location, aesthetic requirements, depth of the fiber underground, and any other requirements shall be approved by the city in writing prior to the instillation of any facilities at a specific location, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupation of a specific portion of the ROW by ExteNet due to a reasonable public interest necessitated by public health, safety and welfare, so long as the authority is exercised in a competitively neutral manner and is not unreasonable or discriminatory. A reasonable public interest shall include the following: 
a.  The prohibition is based upon a recommendation by the city engineer, is related to public health, safety, and welfare and is nondiscriminatory among service and infrastructure providers, including incumbent providers; 
b.  ExteNet has rejected a reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory justification offered by the city for requiring an alternate method or alternate route that will result in neither unreasonable additional installation expense nor a diminution of service quality; 
c.  The city reasonably determines, after affording ExteNet reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety and is imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis; or 
d.  The specific portion of the ROW for which ExteNet seeks use and occupancy is environmentally sensitive as defined by state or federal law or lies within a previously designated (as of the date of submission of the DAS or small wireless facility permit application) historic district as defined by local, state or federal law. 
(e)  ExteNet shall cooperate with the city and follow all legally binding city policies and state and local ordinances with respect to aesthetics. 
(f)  In addition to the approvals required by this section, ExteNet must obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, and any other authorization or approval required by the city (collectively, the "permits and approvals") relating to the installation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities or network and for the use and occupancy of the ROW, including, but not limited to, all permits and approvals required under a city ROW ordinance or zoning regulation and that are not inconsistent with state and federal laws regarding the regulation of the public ROW. The city shall process each valid and administratively complete application for requested permits and approvals in accordance with the time requirements of applicable laws, and shall not unreasonably or unlawfully withhold or delay any permits and approvals. ExteNet shall comply with any condition or requirement set forth in any permit and approval, if they comply with the laws. 
(g)  Except as may otherwise be provided by this article, where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public ROW exists, ExteNet shall place all facilities underground, and/or replace all above-ground facilities with underground facilities, in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city, provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible as determined by both parties. Above-ground pedestals, vaults, or other above-ground facilities, may be installed only if approved by the city where alternative underground facilities are not technically or financially feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise waived pursuant to this section, and shall generally be located behind the sidewalk where feasible and shall be screened from public view. The underground requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the maintenance and repair of existing facilities, as determined by the city engineer. 
(h)  When ExteNet is allowed to place DAS or small wireless facilities above ground under this section, ExteNet may attach its DAS or small wireless facilities to an existing utility pole pursuant to a properly executed agreement with the pole owner provided. If ExteNet locates on an existing utility pole owned by the city, ExteNet shall be responsible for all costs to install and maintain a separate utility meter, and shall pay the electric costs related to its facilities on the city pole. ExteNet agrees that in areas where there are existing poles, ExteNet will work with the owner of that existing pole to collocate DAS or small wireless facilities, but only when the pole owner is willing to allow such attachment and where such attachment is feasible from a safety, technical, and engineering (structural and radio frequency coverage) perspective. Any necessary replacement of any pole to accommodate the attachment shall be subject to the proper exercise of the city's police powers, and in no instance shall ExteNet erect a new pole within an existing aerial pole line absent the city's prior authorization. ExteNet may build new poles or other similar facilities required for the installation of the facilities which would comply with all encroachment and building permits, applicable city, state and federal specifications, and this article. ExteNet hereby grants the city the sole right to use any new poles for city purposes only, including, but not limited to, streetlights and other lighting, so long as such use does not interfere with ExteNet's use of its facilities. This franchise does not grant any third party nor may city grant any third party a right to access any ExteNet owned poles or facilities. ExteNet shall reasonably cooperate with the city in the city's use of the new poles. The city shall not be required to pay a fee to use ExteNet's poles for a city purpose, except that ExteNet may require the city to separately meter and pay for any city electrical use of ExteNet's pole. Except for the installation of the lights and ancillary equipment on or in the new poles and/or as set forth in subsection (j) below, ExteNet shall not be responsible for maintenance, repair, or replacement of city-owned lights, light bulbs and equipment or equipment owned by third parties authorized by the city on the new poles. 
(i)  If ExteNet's pole falls or is damaged such that there is an imminent threat of harm to persons or property, then the city may cause the pole to be removed to the side of the street or a location that city believes reasonably eliminates the risk of such imminent threat of harm to persons or property. ExteNet shall, after written notice from the city that its pole has been damaged or removed, cause its pole to be removed, repaired or replaced within 30 days after the city's written notice. The cost to remove, repair or replace ExteNet's pole, including the replacement city streetlight, bulb and ancillary equipment), shall be paid by ExteNet; provided, however, that if ExteNet's pole is damaged or destroyed by the city or a third party user that the city has given the right to use the pole, then the city and/or its third party user shall pay the cost to repair and/or replace the pole. To the extent that ExteNet seeks reimbursement from a third party either directly or through applicable insurance, the city shall assign to ExteNet any rights the city may have against such third party for such claim. 
(j)  If there is an emergency necessitating response work or repair, ExteNet may begin that repair or emergency response work or take any action required under the circumstances, provided that ExteNet notifies the city promptly after beginning the work and timely thereafter meets any permit or other requirement had there not been such an emergency. 
(k)  In granting this contract franchise ordinance, the city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of the ROW. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon ExteNet. 
(l)  ExteNet shall take all reasonable measures necessary to maintain accurate as completed records in electronic format, of all facilities constructed, reconstructed, or relocated in the ROW. ExteNet shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the ROW when requested by the city or its authorized agents for a public project. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of ExteNet without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(m)  ExteNet may trim trees overhanging the ROW that may come into contact with ExteNet facilities with the prior approval of the city's forester. 
(Ord. No. 7386, § 6, 11-6-18) 
Sec. 15-317. - Removal of facilities due to public project and other causes. 
    Upon receipt of a written demand from the city, ExteNet, at its sole cost and expense, shall remove and relocate any part of the network constructed, installed, used and/or maintained by ExteNet under this contract franchise ordinance, within the reasonable time frame set forth by the city, whenever the city reasonably determines that the removal and/or relocation of any ExteNet facility is needed for any of the following purposes: 
(a)  Due to any work proposed to be done by or on behalf of the city or any other governmental agency, including, but not limited to, any change of grade, alignment or width of any street, sidewalk or other public facility, installation of curbs, gutters or landscaping and installation, construction, maintenance or operation of any underground or aboveground facilities such as sewers, water mains, drains, storm drains, pipes, gas mains, poles, power lines, telephone lines, cable television lines and tracks; or, 
(b)  Because any part of the network or facility is interfering with or adversely affecting the proper operation of city-owned light poles, traffic signals, or other city facilities; or, 
(c)  Because the city is mandated by law, a court order or decision, or the federal or state government to take certain actions that will cause or require the removal of the facilities from the ROW; or, 
(d)  To protect or preserve the public health, safety and welfare. 
    The city shall cooperate with ExteNet in relocating any portion of the network removed pursuant to this section in a manner that allows ExteNet to continue providing service to its customers, including, but not limited to, expediting approval of any necessary permits and approvals required for the relocation of that portion of the relocated network. The city may not charge permitting or other fees for a removal occurring under this section. Any damages suffered by the city or its contractors as a result of ExteNet's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities shall be borne by ExteNet. The parties understand and agree that neither the city nor ExteNet is entitled to compensation for any relocation of the ExteNet network that may be required by this section. ExteNet acknowledges that it is not entitled to relocation assistance or any other compensation or benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act or any other applicable provision of law upon termination of this contract franchise ordinance.

Sec. 15-318. - ExteNet and city access to the facilities. 
(a)  ExteNet will be given reasonable access to each of the facilities in the ROW for the purposes of routine installation, repair, maintenance or removal of facilities. If any such activities have the potential to result in an interruption of the city's use of ExteNet's new poles, ExteNet shall provide the city with a minimum of three days' prior written notice of such activities. Such activities shall, to the extent feasible, be done with minimal impairment, interruption, or interference to city's use of ExteNet's new poles. 
(b)  The city shall have commercially reasonable access to observe and inspect the facilities, and any work conducted by ExteNet during the installation, maintenance and/or repairs of the facilities.

(b)  ExteNet shall, at ExteNet's sole cost and expense, perform all maintenance and repairs reasonably needed to maintain its facilities in good condition and neat and orderly appearance, and in compliance with all applicable laws. In the event any facility requires replacement because such part cannot be repaired, ExteNet shall, at ExteNet's sole cost and expense, replace the irreparable facility. ExteNet shall not cause rubbish, garbage or debris on or around the facilities and shall not permit any rubbish, garbage or debris to accumulate on or around any enclosed areas around the facilities. If the city gives ExteNet written notice of a failure by ExteNet to maintain the facilities, ExteNet shall use its best efforts to remedy such failure within 48 hours after receipt of such written notice. 
(c)  ExteNet shall be responsible for any damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to street pavement, existing facilities and utilities, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, landscaping, and all other public or private facilities, to the extent caused by ExteNet's construction, installation, maintenance, access, use, repair, replacement, relocation, or removal of facilities in the ROW. ExteNet shall promptly repair such damage and restore the ROW and any affected adjacent property to a safe and satisfactory condition to the city in accordance with the city's applicable street or ROW restoration standards, or to the property owner if not the city. If ExteNet fails to make the repairs required by the city, the city may affect those repairs and charge ExteNet the cost of those repairs. If the city incurs damages as a result of a violation of this subsection, then the city shall have a cause of action against ExteNet for violation of this section, and may recover its damages, including reasonable attorney fees, if ExteNet is found liable by a court of competent jurisdiction. ExteNet's obligations under this section shall survive for one year past the completion of such reparation and restoration work and return of the affected part of the ROW by ExteNet to the city, or such longer period as may be established by the city's ROW ordinance, rules or regulations or other applicable laws. 
(Ord. No. 7386, § 9, 11-6-18) 
Sec. 15-320. - Non-interference. 
(a)  ExteNet shall operate its network in a manner that will not cause interference with city non-public safety communications systems and to the services and facilities of other licensees or lessees of city property located at or near the facilities that were in operation prior to the installation of the network or that are in operation prior to any modifications ExteNet may make to the network. 
(b)  ExteNet's network and facilities shall not cause interference with public safety communications systems operated by city or any other public agency, regardless of the date such systems or any components thereof have been placed in service. Nor shall ExteNet's network and facilities cause interference with the city's use of the ExteNet poles for the city's intended city purpose. 
(c)  If such interference with the facilities described in subsections (a) or (b) occurs, ExteNet shall, upon receipt of written notice from the city, immediately commence commercially reasonable, diligent, efforts to correct or eliminate such interference. If such interference cannot be corrected by ExteNet to the reasonable satisfaction of the city within the cure period set forth in the city's notice, which notice shall not be less than 30 days, absent an emergency or danger to public health and safety requiring shorter notice, such interference shall be deemed a material breach under this contract franchise ordinance and city may terminate the contract franchise ordinance. Interference caused by actions of ExteNet's customer(s) remains the responsibility of ExteNet.

Such termination rights under subsection (i) shall be subject to ExteNet's rights to just compensation, if any, from the federal, state or local government requiring such removal for any taking of a protected property right. 
(c)  In the event ExteNet ceases to operate and abandons the network, any facility, or parts thereof, for a period of 90 days or more, ExteNet shall, at its sole cost and expense and within 90 days from the date of abandonment, vacate and remove the network or the abandoned part thereof. If such removal disturbs the facility or adjacent property (including ROW or city real property), ExteNet shall also, at its sole cost and expense, restore or repair the ROW, each facility, and any adjacent property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and further excepting landscaping and related irrigation equipment or other aesthetic improvements made by ExteNet to the facility or adjacent property. Alternatively, the city may allow ExteNet, in the city's sole and absolute discretion, to abandon the network, or any part thereof, in place and convey it to the city.

If the application for a certificate of appropriateness complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in subsection (e), the board must approve the certificate of appropriateness. The board may also approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness if the applicant agrees to meet specific conditions with regard to modifications to the proposed project so that it complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in subsection (e). Written notice of the approval of the application for a certificate of appropriateness, with conditions if applicable, shall be provided the applicant within seven working days following the determination and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness. 
(d)  Denial of a certificate of appropriateness. If the application for a certificate of appropriateness does not comply with the designation ordinance or the criteria for review in subsection (e) and the applicant does not agree to meet specific conditions with regard to modification to the proposed project so that it complies with the designation ordinance and the criteria for review in subsection (e), the board must not approve the certificate of appropriateness. A denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the denial. The historic resources board shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the historic resources board to reconsider its denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the differences between the applicant and the historic resources board. The applicant may resubmit an amended application that takes into consideration the recommendations of the historic resources board. Written notice of the denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be provided the applicant within seven working days following the determination. 
(e)  Criteria for review. In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic resources board shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to the ordinance designating the historic structure, historic site or historic district: 
(1)  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have occurred may be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. 
(8)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(9)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(Ord. No. 6065, Art. V, 4-20-99) 
Sec. 17.5-18. - Fees and enforcement. 
(a)  Fees. Any application for historical designation or certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such fee as shall be specified from time to time by ordinance of the governing body of the city. 
(b)  Civil action. Any person who willfully constructs, reconstructs, alters, restores, renovates, relocates, stabilizes, repairs or demolishes any historic structure or historic site or property within a historic district in violation of this chapter may be required to return the historic structure, historic site, or property to its appearance and setting prior to the violation. Only the city shall have the authority to bring an action to enforce the provisions of this subsection. In the event that the cost of returning the historic structure, historic site or property to its appearance or setting prior to the violation exceeds 50 percent of the value of the historic structure, historic site or property, the offender shall have the option of either returning the historic structure, historic site or property to its appearance and setting prior to the violation or paying to the City of Manhattan a dollar amount equivalent to the cost of reconstruction. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty. 
(Ord. No. 6065, Art. VI, 4-20-99) 
Sec. 17.5-19. - Applicability of prior ordinances. 
    All ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed. Specifically, and in addition, Ordinance No. 3932, adopted February 16, 1982, is hereby repealed except to the extent it applies to the Downtown Historic District, as established by Ordinance No. 3933, adopted February 16, 1982. Both of said ordinances shall remain in effect for the sole purpose of regulating the Downtown Historic District, as created thereunder. The historic resources board, created under the terms of this chapter, shall act as the historic districts review board for the purposes of Ordinance Nos. 3932 and 3933 and the historic districts review board, as created under the prior ordinances, is hereby dissolved.

The body of such Agreement reads, as follows: 
"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF MANHATTAN, KANSAS, AND RILEY COUNTY, KANSAS, RELATING TO JOINT COOPERATION IN PLANNING AND ZONING 
    "THIS AGREEMENT is hereby entered into, pursuant to K.S.A. 12-744, this 6th day of February, 2001, by and between the City of Manhattan, Kansas, a Municipal Corporation, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "City"; and the Board of County Commissioners of Riley County, Kansas, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "County". 
    "WHEREAS, the City and the County have previously entered into an agreement (the "Original Agreement"), pursuant to K.S.A. 12-716, which was effective on May 1, 1976; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the Original Agreement created a Joint Planning Commission (The Manhattan Urban Area Planning Board, hereinafter sometimes referred to as "MUAPB"), to exercise planning functions, both within the corporate limits of the City, and within a designated area outside the City, but within Riley County; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the Original Agreement was amended by the parties several different times, including, on November 6, 1979, to modify the designated area outside the City; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the Original Agreement was again amended by the parties in 1981 to provide for a different method of appointing members of MUAPB; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the City and the County have adopted the Original Agreement and the amendments thereto, by ordinance and resolution respectively; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the Kansas Legislature has repealed K.S.A. 12-716 and replaced it with K.S.A. 12-744, which now provides the authority for cities and counties to cooperate, by written agreement, in the exercise and performance of planning powers, duties and functions and to establish a joint planning commission; and, 
    "WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend, and replace, in their entirety, the Original Agreement and the amendments thereto. 
    "NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
"1.  That the Original Agreement, and all amendments thereto, are hereby amended and replaced, in their entirety, by the provisions set forth hereinafter. 
"2.  The City and the County hereby agree to cooperate in the exercise and performance of planning powers, duties and functions within the Urban Area, all as more specifically set forth hereinafter. 
"3.  That the Joint Planning Commission known as the MUAPB, as created by the Original Agreement, and amendments thereto, is hereby continued, as more specifically set forth hereinafter. The MUAPB shall consist of seven (7) members, with three (3) being appointed by the City, pursuant to its own adopted procedure governing the appointment of members to its Boards, and three (3) being appointed by the County, pursuant to its adopted procedures governing the appointment of members to its boards, and one (1) being alternately appointed by the County and the City, again pursuant to the procedures of the appointing body. The members of the MUAPB shall be appointed for three (3) year terms and the members previously appointed pursuant to the Original Agreement shall continue to serve, and their term shall expire at the same time as it would have expired under their original appointment. The alternating appointment between the City and the County shall continue in the same order as it was previously established under the Original Agreement. The members of the MUAPB, while appointed for a term for the convenience of the jurisdiction appointing them, shall serve in that term at the pleasure of the governing body of the jurisdiction appointing them. In order to qualify for service as a member of the MUAPB, a person must reside within the area of the jurisdiction of the MUAPB. 
"4.  The MUAPB is hereby empowered to carry into effect the provisions of Kansas law delegated to planning commissions, all as set forth in K.S.A. 12-741, et seq., pertaining to matters within the corporate limits of the City of Manhattan, Kansas, and also pertaining to matters within the Urban Area. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Urban Area shall consist of an area lying outside the corporate limits of the City of Manhattan, but within Riley County, the boundaries of which shall be specifically agreed to, in writing, by the governing bodies of the City of Manhattan and Riley County. At the outset of this Agreement, and until modified by written agreement of the parties, the boundaries of the Urban Area are set forth on Exhibit A, attached hereto. The parties hereto agree to review, and modify if necessary, such boundaries on an annual basis, or more frequently, when events occur that cause the administrative staffs of either, or both, governing bodies, to recommend such review and/or modification. 
"5.  (a)  The parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other, and with the MUAPB, in the creation of a single Comprehensive Plan for the City and surrounding Urban Area that is consistent with the City's growth policies and plans. 
"(b)  The parties further agree to cooperate with each other, and the MUAPB, in the creation, and maintenance, of sub-division regulations that are consistent for both the Urban Area and the City of Manhattan. 
"(c)  Any Comprehensive Plan created pursuant to this Agreement shall not be effective until it has been adopted by the MUAPB, pursuant to K.S.A. 12-747, and approved by the governing body of the City, and the Board of the Riley County Commissioners, also pursuant to K.S.A. 12-747. 
"6.  In addition to those duties proscribed by K.S.A. 12-741, et seq., the MUAPB shall continually, when time and priorities permit, make specific recommendations to the governing bodies regarding any matters that might facilitate cooperation between the parties in the providing of governmental services within the Urban Area. Such matters include, by way of example, but are not limited to, the following: 
"(a)  The adoption of codes relating to minimum standards of housing, building, electrical work, plumbing work, and other related areas. 
"(b)  The staffing for administration, inspection and enforcement of all of such codes, as well as sub-division regulations and zoning regulations within the Board's jurisdiction. 
"(c)  The division of cost between the City and the County related to such cooperation. 
"7.  Until such time as plans or regulations provided for herein, or recommendations by the MUAPB, are adopted by the City and the County, the separate regulations of the City shall apply within the corporate limits of the City, and the separate regulations of the County shall apply in the unincorporated area. Further, until the City and the County have adopted joint regulations which provide otherwise, the City and the County shall continue to have separate administrative staffs and personnel for administration, inspection and enforcement; however, these separate staffs are directed to work diligently, and cooperatively, in connection with the efforts of the MUAPB and in furtherance of the purposes of this Agreement. 
"8.  The duration of this Agreement is perpetual unless terminated on January 1 of any given year, by either the City or the County. The party desiring termination shall provide written notice to the other party on, or before, March 1 of the year preceding the effective date of termination. 
"9.  The parties agree to adopt this Agreement, by official action of their governing bodies, pursuant to law."

A tapered transition between the upper pole and cantenna is required to shroud all cabling. The cantenna should be a maximum of 20 inches in diameter. 
(j)  Ground-mounted enclosures. Must follow applicable city ordinances for ground-mounted enclosures and be attached to a concrete foundation. The maximum acceptable dimensions of ground-mounted enclosures is 30 inches wide by 30 inches deep by four feet high. Ground-mounted enclosures must be installed flush to the ground and must match the color of the corresponding pole. Ground-mounted accessory equipment on sidewalks must not interfere with the flow of pedestrian traffic and must conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in regards to appropriate unobstructed sidewalk dimensions. No more than one enclosure is permitted per pole. 
(k)  Pole-mounted enclosures. The lowest point may not be lower than 15 feet above the grade of the ground on which the pole is located. All accessory equipment other than the antenna(s), electric meter and disconnect switch must be concealed within an enclosure not to exceed 11 cubic feet in total volume. It is preferred that the enclosure be mounted flush to the pole. Standoff mounts are permitted for the enclosure, but may not exceed six inches and must include metal shrouding to conceal the space between the shroud and the pole. 
(l)  Height of installations on existing poles. Collocation on existing poles has no height limitation beyond the added height of the cantenna.

(Ord. No. 7144, § 1, 6-16-15; Ord. No. 7190, § 1, 1-19-16) 
Sec. 31-34. - Procedure for impounding motor vehicles. 
(a)  The Riley County Police Department may impound and dispose of vehicles pursuant to and in compliance with K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. or otherwise request for a vehicle to be moved as provided in K.S.A. 8-1103 et seq. pursuant to and in compliance with K.S.A. 8-1102. The governing body of the city hereby finds and determines that the absence of an engine in a vehicle in no way mitigates the effects of abandoning a vehicle or leaving a vehicle unattended in such a manner as to interfere with public highway operations and as a result the same public health, public safety and public welfare justifications which support and make necessary the motor vehicle impoundment and disposition authority and procedures set forth within K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. support and make necessary the impoundment and disposition of any vehicle, as that term is defined in the Standard Traffic Ordinance for Kansas Cities as adopted and amended by the city, under the circumstances and for the reasons described for the impoundment and disposition of motor vehicles in K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. These public health, public safety and public welfare justifications include the public's interest in the safe and orderly flow of traffic and the efficient and predictable removal of vehicles that have been abandoned or left on a public highway or other property open to use by the public or on other real property which is not owned or leased by the person abandoning or leaving the vehicle or by the owner or lessee of such vehicle. Therefore, the Riley County Police Department is hereby additionally empowered to impound and dispose of vehicles that are not motor vehicles under the circumstances described and pursuant to and in compliance with the procedures set forth within K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. for motor vehicles. In the alternative, the Riley County Police Department may also, under the circumstances described and pursuant to and in compliance with the procedures set forth within K.S.A. 8-1102, request for such vehicles to be moved by a wrecker or towing service under the circumstances described and pursuant to and in compliance with the procedures set forth within K.S.A. 8-1103 et seq. The removal, recovery, release, transportation, protection, storage and safekeeping of a vehicle, including the personal property contained therein, that is requested to be removed by a wrecker or towing service pursuant to this section shall only be accomplished pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 8-1103 et seq. 
(b)  The governing body of the city hereby finds and determines that unattended vehicles which are stopped, stood or parked in violation of the Standard Traffic Ordinance for Kansas Cities, as adopted and amended by the city, interfere with public highway operations in several ways, including: 
(1)  Negatively affecting the safe and lawful use of the public sidewalks and highways of the city by pedestrians and impeding the safe and orderly flow of traffic alongside or opposite street excavations and obstructions, upon bridges and other elevated structures, within highway tunnels and over or near railroad tracks, railroad crossings and fire stations; 
(2)  Preventing firefighting and emergency medical equipment, including vehicles used for firefighting or emergency medical purposes, from being maneuvered, parked, located and stood to maximize safe and orderly vehicular traffic upon the public highways or other property open to use by the public while maintaining the safety of emergency response personnel and other persons which may be present during an incident; 
(3)  Causing an unusual delay to traffic that impedes the travel of persons, vehicles and emergency response personnel and equipment; 
(4)  Preventing or otherwise frustrating the use of public highways or other property open to use by the public by adjacent private property owners and other users of such public highways and other property open to use by the public; 
(5)  Creating a potentially hazardous condition; and 
(6)  Endangering the safety and welfare of persons and property by forcing drivers or operators of vehicles which are empowered to stand and park in certain locations to seek other locations to stand and park such vehicles that may not offer the same safety and accommodation of surrounding traffic for the loading or unloading of merchandise or passengers. 
    Therefore, unattended vehicles which are stopped, stood or parked in violation of the Standard Traffic Ordinance for Kansas Cities, as adopted and amended by the city, are subject to immediate removal and impoundment pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. 
(c)  The governing body of the city hereby finds and determines that unattended vehicles which are stopped, stood or parked in violation of section 31-203 of the Code of Ordinances, City of Manhattan, Kansas, interfere with public highway operations in several ways, including preventing the safe and orderly removal and remediation of snow upon the streets of the city which may cause a delay to traffic that impedes the travel of persons, vehicles and emergency response personnel and equipment thereby endangering the safety and welfare of persons and property. Therefore, unattended vehicles which are stopped, stood or parked in violation of section 31-203 of the Code of Ordinances, City of Manhattan, Kansas are subject to immediate removal and impoundment pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1101 et seq. 
(d)  If an impounded vehicle is registered in another state or bears no registration plates and the Riley County Police Department impounds such vehicle, the Riley County Police Department shall, in addition to any and all procedures set forth in K.S.A. 8-1102, take prompt action that is reasonably calculated to apprise the owner and lienholder, if any, of the vehicle's location and potential disposition. Such action may include, but is not limited to, contacting the department of motor vehicles of other states to learn to whom the vehicle is registered, performing a check with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center to determine whether the vehicle has been stolen or obtaining a report from CARFAX or an equivalent entity which shows the state in which the vehicle is titled and/or registered and the presence of any liens. If a report from CARFAX or an equivalent entity is obtained, the Riley County Police Department shall subsequently inquire with the appropriate employees and officials of the state in which the vehicle is titled and/or registered to determine the names and addresses of its owner(s) and any lienholders. If the Riley County Police Department is unsuccessful in determining the name and address of the owner or any lienholder of the vehicle, they shall publish a notice once each week for two consecutive weeks in the official city newspaper describing the vehicle by name of maker, model, color and serial number (if any), and shall further state the reasons for the impoundment, information regarding the rights of the owner/lienholder in the recovery of the vehicle and a statement that unless the owner/lienholder takes action within ten days of the date of the second publication, the vehicle will be sold at public auction to cover the removal and storage costs and publication costs incurred by the Riley County Police Department. If the Riley County Police Department is successful in locating the name and address of the owner or any lienholder, they shall be afforded the same notice by certified mail as set forth in K.S.A. 8-1102(a)(2) for owners registered with the Kansas Department of Revenue Division of Vehicles. 
(e)  Whenever the Riley County Police Department has complied with the foregoing provisions of K.S.A. 8-1102 and this section with respect to any impounded vehicle, and the owner or lienholder does not exercise any of his rights as set forth in K.S.A. 8-1102 and this section within the time stated in the notice, the Riley County Police Department may, pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102 and this section, directly or through its designated agent sell the vehicle at public auction to the highest bidder for cash. 
(f)  Once any vehicle has been impounded pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102 and this section or moved as provided in K.S.A. 8-1103 et seq. in response to a request from an officer of the Riley County Police Department, the owner or lienholder may: 
(1)  Immediately pay the accrued wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees, and thereby regain possession of the vehicle; 
(2)  Provide a surety bond in the amount of the accrued wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees, and thereby immediately regain possession of the vehicle. Upon the posting of a surety bond, the clerk of the municipal court shall schedule a hearing on the validity of the removal or impoundment to be held before the municipal court on a regularly scheduled court day not more than ten calendar days following the posting of the surety bond. If the judge of the municipal court finds that there was no probable cause that the traffic violation attendant with the removal or impoundment occurred and the removal or impoundment was not otherwise justified pursuant to this section and K.S.A. 8-1102, the vehicle shall be immediately released to its lawful owner or possessor without the payment of wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees or any other costs, and the bond posted shall be returned. Upon such a finding, the city shall pay the wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees to the wrecker or towing service which had been in possession of the vehicle; or 
(3)  Demand a hearing on the validity of the removal and impoundment, to be held before the municipal court on the next regularly scheduled court day following the demand. If the judge of the municipal court finds that there was no probable cause that the traffic violation attendant with the removal or impoundment occurred and the removal and impoundment was not otherwise justified pursuant to this section and K.S.A. 8-1102, the vehicle shall be immediately released to its lawful owner or possessor without the payment of wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees or any other costs. Upon such a finding, the city shall pay the wrecker or towing service fees and storage fees to the wrecker or towing service which had been in possession of the vehicle. 
(g)  No vehicle shall be returned until the owner/lienholder provides proof of valid registration (if the vehicle is required to be registered by law) and ownership of the vehicle.

(d)  In any prosecution charging a violation of this section, proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was at the time of the violation a registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute a prima facie presumption that said registered owner of such vehicle was the person who parked such vehicle.

(3)  They encourage pilfering and theft, and constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located thereby causing a loss in property value to surrounding property; 
(4)  They constitute a fire hazard in that they block access for fire equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.

(c)  Sewer usage charges shall be assessed for the purposes of recovering the variable costs of operating the POTW based upon the volume of water a customer uses as determined in section 32-118 below. The volume of water shall be measure in units equal to 100 cubic feet (C cf). The following monthly rates for sewer used shall be as follows: 
Customer Sewer Usage Charge Rates (per C cf) Inside City $ 3.49 Outside City $ 5.24  
(d)  Sewer service charges shall be charged per connection, per monthly billing period, and shall be assessed to all customers who have service availability at any time during a billing period as shown below. A customer is deemed to have service available if the private water service system, at the customer's residence or business, has been connected to the city's water distribution system and at any time during a billing period. The sewer service charges are to be applied regardless of whether or not any water volume passed from the city to private water systems during a billing period. Sewer service connections deemed inactive by the director of public works shall not be assessed sewer service charges. Sewer service charges shall consist of a minimum charge and a meter-based capacity surcharge. 
(1)  Minimum charges shall be assessed for the purposes of recovering fixed costs incurred by the city for operating the POTW, without regard to quantity of customer use. The minimum charge per each connection shall be as follows: 
Customer Sewer Service Minimum Charge Inside City $8.05 Outside City $12.08  
(2)  Capacity surcharges shall be assessed for the purposes of recovering capacity costs incurred by the city for operating the POTW, and shall be based on the water meter size and the customer's capacity to demand water from the water system and discharge wastewater to the POTW. The capacity surcharge per each meter shall be as follows: 
a.  Sewer service capacity surcharge

b.  For customers that utilize a compound meter or fire meter, which consist of a combined two-meter system for the purpose of accurate metering of both high- and low-volume water demands, the larger of the two meters shall be used to determine the monthly capacity surcharge. 
c.  For a one or two-family residential dwelling structure connected to the city water system that require a fire protection sprinkler system, if such sprinkler system requires a larger meter size to provide adequate fire protection, the fire chief, director of public works, or other duly designated representative of the city shall have the authority to determine the appropriate equivalent meter size to assess the meter-based monthly capacity surcharge to better reflect the standard residential meter size that would otherwise be necessary to provide domestic service to the structure. 
(e)  Whenever the city provides sewer service to a wholesale customer located outside of the city limits pursuant to a written contract authorized by the city commission, the rates applicable to the user identified in that contract shall be the rates set forth within the contract, even if such rates are inconsistent with the provisions of this section. 
(f)  Any institution, business or industry having a sewer connection, directly or indirectly, with the POTW and discharging wastewater therein with strengths in excess of 300 mg/L biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 350 mg/L total suspended solids (TSS) to the POTW shall, as they be hereinafter determined from time to time by the director, become subject to a surcharge. The surcharge which is a charge in addition to the metered use charge, shall be computed in accordance with the following surcharge formula: 
S = V × 0.00075 × 8.34 [B$ (BOD - 300) + T$ (TSS - 350)] 
Where: 
S = Surcharge in dollars 
V = Sewage volume in hundred cubic feet 
0.00075 = Conversion factor for hundred cubic feet to million gallons 
8.34 = Pounds per gallon of water 
B$ = Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) unit charge in dollars per pound 
BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand in parts per million by weight or milligrams per liter (mg/L) 
300 = Allowable BOD strength under normal volume charges in parts per million by weight or milligrams per liter (mg/L) 
T$ = Total suspended solids (TSS) unit charge in dollars per pound 
TSS = Total suspended solids strength index in parts per million by weight or milligrams per liter (mg/L) 
350 = Allowable TSS strength under normal volume charges in parts per million by weight or milligrams per liter (mg/L) 
The unit charge for BOD and TSS are hereby established as follows: 
Parameter Unit charge in dollars per pound B$ $0.55/lb T$ $0.38/lb  
(g)  In accordance with section 32-222, the cost of wastewater discharge permits for significant industrial users (SIUs) are hereby established as follows: 
Significant Industrial User (SIU) Annual permit fee Discharging SIU $350.00/Year Non-discharging SIU $155.00/Year  
(h)  All liquid waste haulers are required to obtain an annual liquid waste discharging permit before any discharge of liquid waste to the POTW. The duration of the permit shall be January 1 to December 31. Furthermore, liquid waste haulers are required to pay a discharge fee based on the volume of liquid waste in gallons for each discharge. The cost of liquid waste permit and discharge fees are hereby established as follows: 
Liquid waste permit fee Liquid waste discharge fee $50.00/Year $40.00/1,000 gallons or fraction thereof  
(i)  In addition to the monthly sewer charges set forth in subsections (c) and (d), above, any property located within the city and also within the growth area, as that term is defined within the interlocal agreement (the "agreement") between the City of Manhattan and the Board of Pottawatomie County Commissioners acting as the Governing Body of the Blue Township Sewer Benefit District (the "district"), dated the 12th day of June, 2007 and connected to the district's sewer system, shall be assessed additional monthly sewer charges. The additional monthly sewer charges shall be the same as the sum the city is required to pay to the district, pursuant to Article IX(d)(3) of the agreement, and shall be paid at the same time as the other monthly sewer charges set forth within this section.

Sec. 32-118. - Basis for sewer charge. 
(a)  The basis for the sewer usage charge for residential users shall be an average of the actual water used for the months of December, January and February. This shall be defined as the Winter-Quarter-Average (WQA). Residential users shall be charged based upon this WQA usage from April 1 through March 31. Any residential user that does not have actual usage during December, January, or February, so as to reasonably determine the WQA usage, will be charged based upon the city-wide WQA. 
(b)  The basis for the monthly sewer charges for nonresidential users shall be based upon actual water usage for each of the 12 months; except that the city will permit deviations therefrom upon being satisfied by substantial evidence that is presented to the director of public works that greater than 15 percent of the total annual volume of the water used for all purposes is not discharged to the POTW and that a deduction is therefore appropriate hereunder. A nonresidential user can establish the extent of any water usage that does not discharge to the POTW as follows: 
(1)  The director may require or shall permit the installation of additional meters at the user's expense, in such a manner as to calculate the quantity of water from the connection of such user that does not discharge to the POTW. Any deductions from the monthly sewer charges shall be based upon the quantity of water that does not discharge to the POTW as so determined. 
(2)  If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity of water not discharged to the POTW by aforesaid meters, he or she shall determine the quantity of water not discharged to the POTW in any manner or method as he or she may find practicable in order to arrive at an appropriate deduction from the monthly sewer charges for the quantity of water quantity of water that does not discharge to the POTW as so determined. 
(3)  Any nonresidential user may appeal the decision of the director under this section by submitting a written appeal document stating the grounds of the appeal and any supporting evidence to the city manager within five business days following the director's decision. The city manager or the city manager's designee shall render his/her written decision within five business days following the city manager's receipt of the nonresidential user's appeal, and the decision of the city manager or city manager's designee is final.

Sec. 32-120. - Water meters required. 
    When under the provisions of this division the amount of any monthly sewer usage charges shall be determined wholly or in part by the amount of water used upon any premises furnished with sewer service by the POTW, the quantity of water so used upon the premises shall be measured by the water or wastewater meter(s) serving the premises. If any occupant or owner of any premises connected with the POTW shall obtain water from a source other than the city's water system, then such occupant or owner shall, at his own expense, install and maintain a water or wastewater meter(s) on the premises satisfactory to the director of public works or other duly designated representative of the city. Said meter(s) shall measure all water received on said premises from all sources, or discharged to the POTW and, in addition to the monthly sewer usage charge set forth in section 32-116, all other applicable sewer usage charges shall be based upon the aggregate quantity of water received on the premises as measured by the meter(s). The director of public works or any other duly authorized representative of the city shall have access to the premises of the customer at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting and testing the water meter and reading the records thereof. For all POTW connections located outside of the city limits, where the installation of a water or sewer meter is not feasible, the director of public works or other duly designated representative of the city shall have the authority to determine the appropriate equivalent meter size for the connection based on the usage of the structure(s) in order to establish the required system development charge set forth in section 32-116 and the monthly meter-based sewer system capacity surcharge set forth in section 32-117. 
(Code 1973, § 16-204; Ord. No. 7332, § 5, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 32-121. - Monthly billing; failure to pay. 
(a)  Bills for sewer service rendered from the POTW shall be rendered monthly. All bills shall be due and payable the finance department or at such other place as may be designated by the governing body. If any bill for sewer service shall remain unpaid ten days after the same has been rendered, water service to such customer shall be disconnected and shall not be reconnected until all past due bills for water and sewer service, or either, are paid in full. It shall be the duty of the representative of the city at the time in charge of collection of sewer service charges to notify the director of public works of all delinquencies under this section and the director or his or her designee shall proceed immediately to disconnect water service of any customer so in arrears. 
(b)  Residential owners or occupants may elect to participate in the budget billing plan. The owner or occupant will pay a uniform amount for 11 months with the 12th month being the month to balance the account and compute the uniform monthly payment for the next year. The uniform amount will be based on the average dollar amount of the 12 prior months. Election to establish a budget billing will in no way relieve the owner or occupant of responsibility for payment of any and all actual charges that may accumulate at the service location. Such actual charges are payable annually or upon termination.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Section 7 of Char. Ord. No. 31, adopted Dec. 17, 1996, replaced Art. IV in its entirety and provided for similar provisions as herein set out. Former Art. IV pertained to storm sewers and derived from Ord. No. 4718, § 3, adopted Dec. 17, 1991. 

Division 1 - GENERALLY 

Sec. 32-184. - Creation of stormwater management system. 
    Pursuant to the provisions of Charter Ordinance No. 31, the City of Manhattan does hereby establish a stormwater management system and declares its intention to operate, construct, maintain and repair such stormwater management system. It is hereby found, determined, and declared that the elements of the stormwater management system which provide for the collection, treatment and disposal of stormwater are of benefit, and provide services, to property within the incorporated city limits. The beneficiaries of the system include all real properties within the city which benefit by the provisions, operation and improvement of the system. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater, the reduction of hazard to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff, improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions, and improvement to the water quality in the storm and surface water system and its receiving waters. 
(Char. Ord. No. 31, § 7, 12-17-96; Char. Ord. No. 57, § 4, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 32-185. - Storm drainage fee. 
(a)  User fee established. The City of Manhattan, Kansas ("the city") shall assess against all residential and nonresidential properties within the city limits a monthly fee for use of its stormwater management system. The owner, occupant and any person who is responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall all be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of said fee. Persons responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall include the person responsible for payment for water provided to a master meter that is then distributed to multiple users, whether or not said users are located on the same property as the master meter. The fee shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Equivalent residential unit. The equivalent residential unit ("ERU") is hereby established for purposes of calculating the stormwater utility user fee. The ERU is hereby established to be 3,625 square feet of impervious area. 
(2)  User fee for residential property. The ERU rate for residential property shall be $5.82 per month (the "residential ERU rate"). The stormwater management system user fee for residential property shall be the residential ERU rate multiplied by the number of individual dwelling units existing on the property. The term "residential" shall include single-family homes, mobile homes and mobile home parks, duplexes and apartment units. The term "residential" shall not include rooming and boarding houses, fraternities, sororities and similar facilities. The term "living unit" shall mean one or more rooms in a residential building which are arranged, designed, used or intended for use by one family, and which includes cooking space and lawful sanitary facilities reserved for the occupants thereof. 
(3)  User fee for nonresidential property. The ERU rate for nonresidential property shall be $4.65 per month (the "nonresidential ERU rate"). The stormwater management system user fee for all property which is not residential shall be the nonresidential ERU rate multiplied by a numerical factor calculated by dividing the total impervious area of the property by the number of square feet in one ERU, then rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
(4)  Determining the area of property developed for a particular use. The area measured shall include all property contiguous to the particular use, and under the same ownership, except that portion of said property that is both unimproved and legally subject to being subdivided from that portion actually devoted to the primary use. In situations where property is used in common with more than one use, the common area shall be included with each use in the same proportions as the area of each use bears to the area of the total of all uses. In situations where property is devoted to uses on more than one level, the area of the property shall be proportionately divided among the levels. 
(b)  The revenue generated by this fee shall be set aside in a special fund to be used only for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of stormwater system facilities, including the acquisition, and related costs thereof, of real estate for such use. In addition, said fund may be used to pay fees to study and prepare documents related to such facilities, and to make payments of principal and interest on bonds issued for such improvements. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to limit or restrict the city's ability to use and obtain other sources of funds for the same or similar purposes. 
(c)  The monthly fees set forth above may be included as part of the monthly bill for water and sanitary sewer service, but shall be identified separately on said billing, said fees shall be due at the same time as water charges are due and the failure to pay said fees shall be considered a failure to pay water charges and enforceable pursuant to section 32-51 of this Code. If the monthly fees are not included as part of a water or sewer bill, they shall be billed at least annually. In addition, any time water service is established, or re-established, to a property, all fees hereunder shall be paid current, as of the date such water service is established, or re-established. 
(d)  (1)  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of their storm drainage fee or, who believes that the actual amount of impervious area located upon their property justifies a reduction in the square footage of their property used to calculate the fee, in order to make their fee consistent with other uses with a similar amount of impervious area, may appeal the determination of their fee to the city engineer. The appeal shall be in writing. The city engineer shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The city engineer, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing dwelling units, total property area, and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the city engineer. Based upon information provided, the city engineer shall make a determination of the storm drainage fee for such property. The city engineer shall notify parties in writing of his/her decision. 
(2)  A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the city engineer to a board comprised of the city manager, or his designee, the director of public works, and the director of community development. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days of the date of the written decision of the city engineer. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the city engineer. A hearing on such appeal shall be held within 30 days from the date of filing and the applicant shall be given seven days' advance notice of the time and date of such hearing. Within seven days after the conclusion of such hearing, the board shall render a decision in writing that sets forth findings that support its decision. The decision of the board shall be final and any further appeal of such decision shall be to the district court pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d).

"Consistent Removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the wastewater discharge which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 C.F.R., Section 403.7. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(Ord. No. 6706, § 25, 7-1-08) 
Sec. 32-215. - Specific pollutant limitations. 
    The director shall establish local numerical limits of discharge concentrations and/or mass limits for parameters that must be regulated by the city to prevent pass through or interference. These local limits will be applied at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW or end-of-pipe, unlike the federal categorical standards that apply at the end-of-process. The aggregate permitted discharge from all users shall not exceed the mass limits per day established by the director and approved by the approval authority. The director may establish best management practices (BMPs) to implement the prohibitions found in section 32-212. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of this article and Section 307(d) of the Act. 
(Ord. No. 6706, § 26, 7-1-08) 
Sec. 32-216. - State requirements.

Sec. 32-217. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Special agreements and arrangements between the city and any user may be established when in the opinion of the director, unusual or extraordinary circumstances compel special terms or conditions. State and federal standards may not be waived by special agreements. 
(Ord. No. 6706, § 28, 7-1-08) 
Sec. 32-218. - Dilution prohibited. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 6706, § 29, 7-1-08)

ARTICLE IV. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
    Section 32-184. Creation of Storm Water Management System. 
    Pursuant to the provisions of Charter Ordinance No. 31, the City of Manhattan does hereby establish a stormwater management system and declares its intention to operate, construct, maintain and repair such stormwater management system. It is hereby found, determined, and declared that the elements of the stormwater management system which provide for the collection, treatment and disposal of stormwater are of benefit, and provide services, to property within the incorporated City limits. The beneficiaries of the system include all real properties within the City which benefit by the provisions, operation and improvement of the system. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater, the reduction of hazard to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff, improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions, and improvement to the water quality in the storm and surface water system and its receiving waters. 
    Section 32-185. Storm Drainage Fee. 
A.  There is hereby assessed against all property within the City that is connected to either the water or sanitary sewer systems, or both, of the City a monthly storm drainage fee. Such fee is based upon a determination, using accepted engineering principals, of a comparable amount of impervious area for uses within each rate category, as set forth hereinafter. The owner, occupant and any person who is responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall all be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of said fee. Persons responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall include the person responsible for payment for water provided to a master meter that is then distributed to multiple users, whether or not said users are located on the same property as the master meter. The fee shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  All property devoted to a residential use shall be assessed the sum of One Dollar and Ten Cents ($1.10) per month per living unit. The term "residential" shall include single family homes, mobile homes and mobile home parks, duplexes and apartment units. The term "residential" shall not include rooming and boarding houses, fraternities, sororities and similar facilities. The term "living unit" shall mean one or more rooms in a residential building which are arranged, designed, used or intended for use by one family, and which includes cooking space and lawful sanitary facilities reserved for the occupants thereof. 
2.  Property devoted to any use other than residential, as set forth above, shall be assessed a monthly fee based upon the number of square feet developed for that particular use, as follows: 
Less than or equal to 20,000 square feet ..... $ 5.20 
20,001 to 100,000 square feet ..... 25.00 
100,001 to 200,000 square feet ..... 50.00 
200,001 to 400,000 square feet ..... 100.00 
400,001 to 1,000,000 square feet ..... 208.00 
1,000,001 to 2,000,000 square feet ..... 390.00 
2,000,001 to 4,000,000 square feet ..... 710.00 
4,000,001 to 6,000,000 square feet ..... 870.00 
6,000,001 to 8,000,000 square feet ..... 1,000.00 
8,000,001 to 10,000,000 square feet ..... 1,100.00 
10,000,001 to 12,000,000 square feet ..... 1,160.00 
For all properties in excess of 12,000,000 square feet (275 acres) the fee shall be $4.23 multiplied by the number of acres in the property. 
3.  In determining the area of property developed for a particular use, the area measured shall include all property contiguous to the particular use, and under the same ownership, except that portion of said property that is both unimproved and legally subject to being subdivided from that portion actually devoted to the primary use. In situations where property is used in common with more than one use, the common area shall be included with each use in the same proportions as the area of each use bears to the area of the total of all uses. In situations where property is devoted to uses on more than one level, the area of the property shall be proportionately divided among the levels. 
B.  The revenue generated by this fee shall be set aside in a special fund to be used only for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of stormwater system facilities, including the acquisition, and related costs thereof, of real estate for such use. In addition, said fund may be used to pay fees to study and prepare documents related to such facilities, and to make payments of principal and interest on bonds issued for such improvements. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to limit or restrict the City's ability to use and obtain other sources of funds for the same or similar purposes. 
C.  The monthly fees set forth above may be included as part of the monthly bill for water and sanitary sewer service, but shall be identified separately on said billing, said fees shall be due at the same time as water charges are due and the failure to pay said fees shall be considered a failure to pay water charges and enforceable pursuant to Section 32-51 of this Code. If the monthly fees are not included as part of a water or sewer bill, they shall be billed at least annually. In addition, anytime water service is established, or reestablished, to a property, all fees hereunder shall be paid current, as of the date such water service is established, or re-established. 
D.  1.  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of their storm drainage fee or, who believes that the actual amount of impervious area located upon their property justifies a reduction in the square footage of their property used to calculate the fee, in order to make their fee consistent with other uses with a similar amount of impervious area, may appeal the determination of their fee to the City Engineer. The appeal shall be in writing. The City Engineer shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The City Engineer, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing dwelling units, total property area, and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the City Engineer. Based upon information provided, the City Engineer shall make a determination of the storm drainage fee for such property. The City Engineer shall notify parties in writing of his/her decision. 
2.  A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the City Engineer to a board comprised of the City Manager, or his designee, the Director of Public Works, and the Director of Community Development. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days of the date of the written decision of the City Engineer. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the City Engineer. A hearing on such appeal shall be held within 30 days from the date of filing and the applicant shall be given seven days advance notice of the time and date of such hearing. Within seven days after the conclusion of such hearing, the Board shall render a decision in writing that sets forth findings that support its decision. The decision of the Board shall be final and any further appeal of such decision shall be to the District Court pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d).

Section 32-185. Storm Drainage Fee. 
A.  There is hereby assessed against all property within the City that is connected to either the water or sanitary sewer systems, or both, of the City a monthly storm drainage fee. Such fee is based upon a determination, using accepted engineering principals [principles], of a comparable amount of impervious area for uses within each rate category, as set forth hereinafter. The owner, occupant and any person who is responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall all be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of said fee. Persons responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall include the person responsible for payment for water provided to a master meter that is then distributed to multiple users, whether or not said users are located on the same property as the master meter.

3.  In determining the area of property developed for a particular use, the area measured shall include all property contiguous to the particular use, and under the same ownership, except that portion of said property that is both unimproved and legally subject to being subdivided from that portion actually devoted to the primary use. In situations where property is used in common with more than one use, the common area shall be included with each use in the same proportions as the area of each use bears to the area of the total of all uses. In situations where property is devoted to uses on more than one level, the area of the property shall be proportionately divided among the levels. 
B.  The revenue generated by this fee shall be set aside in a special fund to be used only for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of stormwater system facilities, including the acquisition, and related costs thereof, of real estate for such use. In addition, said fund may be used to pay fees to study and prepare documents related to such facilities, and to make payments of principal and interest on bonds issued for such improvements. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to limit or restrict the City's ability to use and obtain other sources of funds for the same or similar purposes. 
C.  The monthly fees set forth above may be included as part of the monthly bill for water and sanitary sewer service, but shall be identified separately on said billing, said fees shall be due at the same time as water charges are due and the failure to pay said fees shall be considered a failure to pay water charges and enforceable pursuant to Section 32-51 of this Code. If the monthly fees are not included as part of a water or sewer bill, they shall be billed at least annually. In addition, any time water service is established, or re-established, to a property, all fees hereunder shall be paid current, as of the date such water service is established, or re-established. 
D.  1.  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of their storm drainage fee or, who believes that the actual amount of impervious area located upon their property justifies a reduction in the square footage of their property used to calculate the fee, in order to make their fee consistent with other uses with a similar amount of impervious area, may appeal the determination of their fee to the City Engineer. The appeal shall be in writing. The City Engineer shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The City Engineer, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing dwelling units, total property area, and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the City Engineer. Based upon information provided, the City Engineer shall make a determination of the storm drainage fee for such property. The City Engineer shall notify parties in writing of his/her decision. 
2.  A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the City Engineer to a board comprised of the City Manager, or his designee, the Director of Public Works, and the Director of Community Development. Such appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) days of the date of the written decision of the City Engineer. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the City Engineer. A hearing on such appeal shall be held within thirty (30) days from the date of filing and the applicant shall be given seven (7) days advance notice of the time and date of such hearing.

The decision of the Board shall be final and any further appeal of such decision shall be to the District Court pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d). 
    Section 3. All portions of the Original Ordinance, not amended hereby, shall remain in full force and effect. 
    Section 4. This Charter Ordinance shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in the official City newspaper. 
    Section 5. This is a Charter Ordinance and shall take effect sixty-one (61) days after final publication, or on April 1, 2007, whichever date is later, unless a sufficient petition for a referendum is filed requiring a referendum to be held on this ordinance as provided in Article 12, Section 5, subdivision (c) (3) of the Constitution of the State of Kansas in which case the ordinance shall become effective on April 1, 2007, or on the first day of the month following approval by a majority of the electors voting thereon, whichever date is later.

The owner, occupant and any person who is responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall all be jointly and severally responsible for the payment of said fee. Persons responsible for the payment of water and/or sewer service to the property shall include the person responsible for payment for water provided to a master meter that is then distributed to multiple users, whether or not said users are located on the same property as the master meter.

3.  In determining the area of property developed for a particular use, the area measured shall include all property contiguous to the particular use, and under the same ownership, except that portion of said property that is both unimproved and legally subject to being subdivided from that portion actually devoted to the primary use.

D.  1.

The appeal shall be in writing. The City Engineer shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The City Engineer, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing dwelling units, total property area, and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the City Engineer.

In the event any person, firm, corporation, political unit or organization living or operating on property served by the City's Sewer System or Sewer Systems shall neglect, fail or refuse to pay the service charges fixed by the Governing Body of the City, the City may, as authorized by rules and regulations adopted under the authority of this section and if a unified and consolidated billing system has been established, refuse the delivery of water through the pipes and mains of its publicly owned waterworks until such time as such charges are fully paid. 
    SECTION 4. Amendment/Repeal. The City of Manhattan does hereby repeal Charter Ordinance No. 56, and does hereby amend Section 7 of the Original Ordinance as follows: 
Sec. 32-384 [32-184]. Creation of Storm Water Management System. 
Pursuant to the provisions of Charter Ordinance No. 31, the City of Manhattan does hereby establish a storm water management system and declares its intention to operate, construct, maintain and repair such storm water management system. It is hereby found, determined, and declared that the elements of the storm water management system which provide for the collection, treatment and disposal of storm water are of benefit, and provide services, to property within the incorporated City limits. The beneficiaries of the system include all real properties within the City which benefit by the provisions, operation and improvement of the system. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of storm water, the reduction of hazard to property and life resulting from storm water runoff, improvement in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable storm water conditions, and improvement to the water quality in the storm and surface water system and its receiving waters. 
Sec. 32-185. Storm Drainage Fee. 
A.  There is hereby assessed against all property within the City that is connected to either the water or sanitary sewer systems, or both, of the City a monthly storm drainage fee. The method of calculating and fixing these service fees shall be as established by ordinary ordinances or by rules and regulations herefore or hereafter adopted. 
B.  The revenue generated by this fee shall be set aside in a special fund to be used only for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of storm water system facilities, including the acquisition, and related costs thereof, of real estate for such use. In addition, said fund may be used to pay fees to study and prepare documents related to such facilities, and to make payments of principal and interest on bonds issued for such improvements. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to limit or restrict the City's ability to use and obtain other sources of funds for the same or similar purposes. 
C.  The monthly fees set forth above may be included as part of the monthly bill for water and sanitary sewer service, but shall be identified separately on said billing, said fees shall be due at the same time as water charges are due and the failure to pay said fees shall be considered a failure to pay water charges and enforceable pursuant to Section 32-51 of this Code. If the monthly fees are not included as part of a water or sewer bill, they shall be billed at least annually. In addition, any time water service is established, or re-established, to a property, all fees hereunder shall be paid current, as of the date such water service is established, or re-established. 
D.  1.  Any person who disagrees with the calculation of their storm drainage fee or, who believes that the actual amount of impervious area located upon their property justifies a reduction in the square footage of their property used to calculate the fee, in order to make their fee consistent with other uses with a similar amount of impervious area, may appeal the determination of their fee to the City Engineer. The appeal shall be in writing. The City Engineer shall thereafter hold an informal hearing. The City Engineer, prior to such hearing, may request that the appealing party provide information concerning the basis of the appeal, including a land survey showing dwelling units, total property area, and impervious area, as appropriate, if such information is deemed to be material by the City Engineer. Based upon information provided, the City Engineer shall make a determination of the storm drainage fee for such property. The City Engineer shall notify parties in writing of his/her decision. 
2.  A person shall have the right to appeal the decision of the City Engineer to a board comprised of the City Manager, or his designee, the Director of Public Works, and the Director of Community Development. Such appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) days of the date of the written decision of the City Engineer. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the City Engineer. A hearing on such appeal shall be held within thirty (30) days from the date of filing and the applicant shall be given seven (7) days advance notice of the time and date of such hearing. Within seven (7) days after the conclusion of such hearing, the Board shall render a decision in writing that sets forth findings that support its decision. The decision of the Board shall be final and any further appeal of such decision shall be to the District Court pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d). 
    SECTION 5. Amendment. The City of Manhattan does hereby amend Section 8 of the Original Ordinance, by removing said Section 8 in its entirety and inserting the following: 
SECTION 8. Nothing contained within this Charter Ordinance shall prohibit the Governing Body from the exercising authority granted hereunder by the adoption of simple ordinances enacted after the date hereof, including amendments to Article IV of Chapter 32 of the Code of Ordinances. 
    SECTION 6. Charter Ordinance No. 56 is hereby repealed and all portions of the Original Ordinance, not amended hereby, shall remain in full force and effect. 
    SECTION 7. This Charter Ordinance shall be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in the official City newspaper. 
    SECTION 8. This is a Charter Ordinance and shall take effect sixty-one (61) days after final publication, or on July 1, 2018, whichever date is later, unless a sufficient petition for a referendum is filed requiring a referendum to be held on this ordinance as provided in Article 12, Section 5, subdivision (c)(3) of the Constitution of the State of Kansas in which case the ordinance shall become effective on July 1, 2018, or on the first day of the month following approval by a majority of the electors voting thereon, whichever date is later.

that is proposed to be constructed or expanded may choose to either proceed
pursuant to this section, or may comply with sections of these regulations
applicable to the uses set forth in Article IV. Other than this Section, no
provision of these regulations, except those provisions generally applicable to
all regulations herein, such as provisions dealing with interpretation or

(D) The proposed construction or expansion of any public utility or facility,
III-11
ARTICLE III GENERAL PROVISIONS
subject to this section, shall not proceed until such is authorized by an
ordinance adopted by the Governing Body. The adoption of such an
ordinance shall not be considered to be an amendment to the zoning
regulations, nor shall it be considered to be a rezoning of the property
involved. Requests for the adoption of such an ordinance shall be submitted
by the owner of such utility or facility to the Zoning Administrator on forms
provided by said Zoning Administrator. The request shall include documents
and evidence, as required by staff, the Planning Board or the Governing Body,
such as an appropriate site plan, sufficient for the Planning Board and
Governing Body to evaluate the factors set forth in Section (F).
(E) Upon receipt of such a request, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule a
public hearing on said request in front of the Manhattan Urban Area Planning
Board. Notice of such public hearing shall be given pursuant to Section
15-202 of these regulations, as though such request were an amendment to the
zoning of said property. Thereafter, the Manhattan Urban Area Planning
Board shall proceed to conduct such public hearing on said request.
(F) At the conclusion of the hearing required by the preceding section, the
Manhattan Urban Area Planning Board shall forward their recommendation
on the request to the Governing Body. Such recommendation shall include all
factors and reasons the Planning Board relies upon to support such
recommendation. In arriving at such recommendation, the Planning Board
shall balance the public interests to be served by the construction or expansion
of the utility or facility, as opposed to the impact upon interests intended to be
protected by these zoning regulations. In balancing such interests, the
Planning Board shall consider factors, such as:
(1) The nature and scope of the municipality or state agency making the
request; and,
(2) The function of the utility or facility; and,
(3) The extent of the public interest to be served by the utility or facility;
and,
(4) The effect that regulation of the construction, or expansion, either by
the imposition of requirements necessary to mitigate impacts or by a
complete denial, will have upon the municipality's, or state agency's,
ability to efficiently, economically and prudently meet the public
interests they are serving; and,
(5) The impact that construction or expansion of the utility or facility will
have upon legitimate interests of that portion of the community in
which it is proposed to be located; and,
III-12
ARTICLE III GENERAL PROVISIONS
(6) If the owner of the utility or facility is the City of Manhattan, and if the
facility or utility is of a type embraced within the Comprehensive Plan,
whether or not it is in conformity with that Plan; and,
(7) Such other factors as the Planning Board deems appropriate and
relevant.
(G) The Planning Board shall not recommend approval of the request unless it
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the public interests to be
served by the construction or expansion of the utility or facility outweigh any
impact upon legitimate community interests, as such impact is mitigated by
any requirements of the Planning Board.
(H) If the Planning Board recommends approval, they shall also recommend any
requirements or conditions they deem necessary to mitigate impacts caused by
such use. Such requirements or conditions may include, but are not limited to,
any bulk, or other requirements, which would have otherwise been applicable
within the zoning district in which the proposed use is to be placed.
(I) Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board pursuant to this
section, the Governing Body shall consider the request. As a part of such
consideration, the Governing Body shall schedule a public hearing on said
request and notice of such public hearing shall be given in the same manner as
required by Sub-Paragraph E above. In evaluating a request, the Governing
Body shall consider all factors set forth in Sub-Section F and shall also
consider the recommendation and reasoning of the Planning Board. The
Governing Body is not bound by the recommendations of the Planning Board,
nor is it obligated to return the matter to the Planning Board unless the
Governing Body chooses to do so. If the Governing Body desires to approve
the request, it shall do so by the adoption of an ordinance. The Governing
Body shall not approve the request unless it determines, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that the public interest to be served by the construction or
expansion of the utility or facility outweighs the impacts upon legitimate
community interests, as such impacts are mitigated by requirements of the
Governing Body. The Governing Body in any ordinance approving such
request may establish such conditions as it deems necessary to mitigate any
impacts created by such use.
(J) As used herein, the phrase "preponderance of the evidence" means that the
issue being decided is more probably true than not true.
3-413. Architectural and Aesthetic Standards for Residential-Design Manufactured Homes.
In order to be classified as a Residential-Design Manufactured Home, such home
shall meet the following architectural and aesthetic standards:

permanent masonry foundation or curtain wall, unpierced except for required
ventilation and access, shall be installed under the perimeter of the home.

of these regulations which amendments would have made illegal the
issuance of such permit, and
(6) Construction pursuant to such permit is completed prior to the
expiration of such permit.
(7) When a structure is completed under a permit to which this applies, an
occupancy certificate shall be issued in accordance with the zoning
regulations in effect at the time the building permit was issued.
(B) Single Family Residential Developments. For the purpose of single family
residential developments, development rights in such land use shall vest upon
recording of a plat of such land. If construction is not commenced on such
land within five (5) years of recording a plat, the development rights in such
shall expire.
(C) No building permit shall be issued after the notice has been published
concerning a proposed amendment to these regulations, or amendment to the
zoning classification of a specific piece of property, unless the request
complies with both the existing regulations and classification as well as the
proposed amendment. This provision shall not apply to property vested
pursuant to paragraph (B) above.

Regulations User Guide.
(B) Measurement of the Area of a Sign.
(1) Signs in Frames or Cabinets. The area of a sign enclosed in a frame or cabinet
shall be determined on the basis of the outer dimensions of the frame or
cabinet surrounding the sign face(s). The area and dimensions of the sign shall
encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle,
etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or
approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display.

Similar Surface of a Building or Structure. The area and dimensions of the
sign shall be encompassed by a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle,
trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which
form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, and any
applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building or
structure. When separate elements are organized to form a single message, but
are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated
by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which
encompass all of the display areas, including the space between different
elements. For signs with mixed case lettering, a rectangle shall be drawn
around either the ascending or descending letters, but not both.
(3) Monument Signs. The sign area shall be determined by the regular geometric
shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular
geometric shapes that encompass the perimeter of the sign display or message
and all portions of a background surface that differentiate the message display
area from the overall monument structure.
(4) Pylon Signs. The sign area shall be determined by the regular geometric shape
(rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular
geometric shapes that encompass the perimeter of the freestanding structure,
but shall not include:
(a) The pole or other structural support, unless such pole or structural
support is internally illuminated, or otherwise so designed to constitute a
display device, or to be an integral part of the sign display.

not an integral part of the sign display, which may consist of
ARTICLE VI SIGNS
VI - 13
landscaping, retaining walls, or structural forms complementing the site
in general.
(5) Three Dimensional Signs. The sign face area shall be determined on the basis
of the maximum surface area visible from any one (1) perspective.
(6) Awnings, Canopies and Marquees. When signs are incorporated into awnings,
canopies and marquees, the sign area shall be determined by measuring the
area encompassed by a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid,
triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or
approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the sign display or message.
(7) Temporary Signs. The sign area shall be determined on the basis of the
perimeter dimensions of the Temporary Sign.
(8) Double-Faced Signs.
(a) When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both
faces cannot be viewed from any single perspective at the same time,
and are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed
by measurement of one of the two (2) faces. When a sign has more than
two (2) display surfaces, the area of the sign shall be the area of largest
display surfaces that are visible from any single perspective.
(b) When a double-faced sign having nonparallel faces such that the angle
between the faces exceeds twenty-four (24) degrees, the sign area shall
be calculated as the total of both sign faces.
(C) Determining Sign Height.
(1) The height of a Pylon or Monument Sign shall be measured from the base of
the signs supportive structure at its point of attachment to the ground, to the
highest point of the sign structure.
(2) The height of a Wall Sign shall be measured from the point where the
supporting wall meets the ground to the top of the highest point of the Wall
Sign.

maintained to eliminate blowing dust and erosion.
(c) Those residential land uses required to have six (6) or fewer
parking spaces may construct such parking areas, parking
spaces, travelways, driveways, ingress and egress of compacted
gravel. However, paving shall be required for such purposes
between the front property line and the setback of the principal
structure, or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater.
(4) Drainage. Parking areas should be designed to promote efficient
disposal of storm water. All storm water runoff to adjacent property

determining off-street parking requirements, areas devoted to storage,
hallways, stairwells, elevators, bathrooms, or mechanical rooms shall
not be included. When determination of the number of off-street

of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or less may be
disregarded; and a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as
one parking space.
(9) Collective Provisions. Off-street parking facilities for separate uses

it has previously conformed to all applicable Zoning Regulations, or has not
been subject to such regulations, and it has remained in the same condition
continuously since such time, and the only reason it no longer conforms, is
because of a change in the regulations. Legally nonconforming properties

combination thereof only if:
(1) The lot is at least twenty-five (25) feet in width; and
(2) The lot has never been held in common ownership with adjacent
property during any period of its nonconformity; and
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-2
(3) The lot has never been transferred during any period of its
nonconformity whereby both the transferor and the transferee
voluntarily entered into such transfer, except for transfers from a
purchaser at a judicial sale.
(B) Construction permitted by Section 8-201(A) shall comply with all of the
regulations (except lot area, width and depth) applicable to single-family
dwellings in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located;
provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall apply in
place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
(1) The dwelling shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each
side of the dwelling.
(2) The sum of the widths of the two yards on each lot shall be not less than
the smaller of:
(a) Twenty-five (25) percent of the width of the lot, or
(b) The minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk
regulations for said zoning district.
(3) No side yard shall be less than ten (10) percent of the width of the lot,
and in no case less than three feet.
8-202. In Districts Other Than Residential Districts.
(A) In any district other than a residential district, notwithstanding the regulations
imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a building designed for
any permitted use may be erected on a lot that is legally nonconforming,
because of lot area, width, depth, or any combination thereof only if:

property during any period of its nonconformity; and

nonconformity, whereby both the transferor and the transferee
voluntarily entered into such transfer, except for transfers from a
purchaser at a judicial sale.
(B) Construction permitted by Section 8-202(A) shall comply with all of the
regulations (except lot area, width and depth) applicable in the zoning district
in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the width of
any side yard need not be greater than that derived by applying the following
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-3
formula (wherein the width of any side yard required = X):
(Actual lot width) x (district's minimum side yard)
X = ---------------------------------------------------------
district's minimum lot width
PART 3. IMPROVED NONCONFORMING LOTS
8-301. Authority to Continue. Any improved lot which is devoted to a use permitted in the
zoning district where it is located, but which is legally nonconforming for other

subject to the remaining sections of this part.
8-302. Enlargement, Repair, Alterations. Improvements upon a lot described in Section
8-301 may be added, enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled, provided,
however, that no such addition, enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling
shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing
nonconformity of all or any part of such lot. Any such enlargement, maintenance,
repair, remodeling, restoration, or addition upon lots that are legally nonconforming
because of lot size shall maintain side yards in accordance with Section 8-201 in the
case of residential property, and Section 8-202 in the case of nonresidential property.
8-303. Damage or Destruction.
(A) In the event that any improvement described in Section 8-301 is damaged or
destroyed, by any means, to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its total
market value, such improvement shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located;
provided that the improvements located on a lot which does not comply with
the applicable lot size requirements shall maintain side yards in accordance
with Section 8-201 in the case of residential property, and Section 8-202 in
the case of nonresidential property.
(B) When any improvement is damaged to a total extent of less than fifty (50)
percent, it may be repaired or restored, pursuant to Section 8-302, if a building
permit is obtained and repair or restoration is actually begun within one (1)
year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to
completion; otherwise any such repairs or restoration must comply with the
regulations of the Zoning District in which it is located.
(C) Not-withstanding the above, any improvement, described in Section 8-301,
which is damaged to any extent, or totally destroyed, may be repaired,
restored, or rebuilt, to its prior condition, if all of the following conditions are
met, to-wit:
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-4
(1) The nonconformity was created by the City of Manhattan acquiring a
portion of the property upon which the improvement is located; and,
(2) The acquisition document (i.e., deed, easement, eminent domain
petition, etc.) contains language substantially as follows: "The
provisions of Section 8-303(C) of the Manhattan Zoning Regulations
apply to this acquisition."; and,
(3) The repair, restoration or rebuilding of the improvement does not create
any additional nonconformity, or increase the degree of nonconformity,
of the improvement as it originally existed; and,
(4) A building permit is obtained and repair, restoration, or rebuilding is
actually begun within one (1) year after the date of such damage or
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
8-304. Moving. No improvement described in Section 8-301 shall be moved in whole or in
part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless the entire improvement shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
PART 4. NONCONFORMING USES
8-401. Authority to Continue. Any legally nonconforming use of part or all of a structure
or any legally nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure or only
involving a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so
long as otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Sections 8-402
through 8-406.
8-402. Expansion. A legally nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged or
increased in intensity beyond that which existed at the time it became legally
nonconforming. Any change in a legal nonconforming use which requires the use of
additional structures, additional land area, or additional floor space within the same
structure not originally designed or arranged for such use, shall be deemed an
expansion, enlargement or increase in violation of this section.
8-403. Change in Use. A legally nonconforming use shall not be changed or modified in
any manner from what existed at the time it became legally nonconforming, without
complying with all applicable regulations. A legal nonconforming use shall not be
deemed to have been changed or modified as long as:
(A) it reflects the nature and purpose of the use prevailing at the time it became
legally nonconforming; and,
(B) there is no difference in the intensity and character of the use; and,
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-5
(C) there is no different effect upon the neighborhood.
8-404. Land Uses. All legally nonconforming uses of land, not involving a structure or
involving only structures which are accessory to such use of land, shall be
eliminated or made to conform with the regulations of the zoning district in which
located within two years from the date such use became legally nonconforming.
8-405. Structures Devoted to Legally Nonconforming Uses.
(A) No structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a legally nonconforming
use shall be remodeled, enlarged or added to in any manner unless the entire
structure, and the use thereof, shall thereafter conform to all applicable zoning
regulations.
(B) Normal maintenance and incidental repair of a structure, which does not
expand, enlarge or increase the degree of the legal nonconformity shall not be
a violation of this section. Normal maintenance and incidental repair of a
structure may include the replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing
walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing.
(C) Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, or
restoring to a safe condition, of a structure in compliance with any order
pursuant to legislative authority dealing with unsafe structures, as long as such
strengthening or restoration is not in violation of 8-402, or 8-405(D).
(D) When any principal structure, except those in (E) hereafter, devoted in whole,
or in part, to a legally nonconforming use is damaged to an extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value, or an accessory structure or
combination of structures are damaged such that the damage is greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of all structures on the property,
the legally nonconforming use shall cease, and all uses thereafter existing on
said property shall comply with all applicable zoning regulations. When such
a structure, or combination of structures, is damaged to an extent of fifty
percent (50%) or less of its fair market value, such use may continue only if a
permit is obtained and repairs are commenced within one (1) year of the date
of damage and are diligently pursued to completion.
(E) When any residential dwelling, or dwellings, located in a residential district
are legally nonconforming and are damaged or destroyed by any means, other
than the willful act of the owner, such structure may be restored so that such
use may continue if a building permit is issued and restoration is begun within
one (1) year of the damage, is diligently pursued to completion, and no greater
number of living units are provided than existed prior to the damage and no
greater nonconformity exists than existed prior to the damage.
8-406. Abandonment.
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-6
(A) No legally nonconforming use shall be reestablished or resumed after it has
been abandoned. In order for a use to be abandoned, there must be an intent
on the part of the user to abandon the use, and an overt act or failure to act,
which carries the implication that the user does not claim or retain any interest
in the nonconforming use.
(B) Notwithstanding (A), when a nonconforming use of land, not involving a
structure, or involving only a structure which is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land, is discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive
months (regardless of any intent not to abandon such use), such use shall not
thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy
of such land shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which
such land is located.
(C) Notwithstanding (A), when a nonconforming use of a part or all of the
structure which was designed and intended for a use which is permitted in the
zoning district in which such structure is located, regardless of how it was
originally used or is presently being used, is discontinued for a period of
twelve (12) consecutive months (regardless of any intent not to abandon such
use), such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any
subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the
regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
(D) Notwithstanding (A), when a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure
which was not designed or intended for any use which is permitted in the
zoning district in which such structure is located, regardless of how it was
originally used or is presently being used, is discontinued for a period of
eighteen (18) consecutive months (regardless of any intent not to abandon
such use), such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any
subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the
regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
PART 5. MODIFYING NONCONFORMING USES UTILIZING A CONDITIONAL USE
APPLICATION
8-501. Authorization. Any legally nonconforming use shall be deemed to be a conditional
use of the zoning district in which it is located. The Board of Zoning Appeals is
hereby authorized to grant such conditional use and subsequent amendments thereto,
subject to the following:
(A) All procedures and conditions which are applicable to the granting of such
conditional use and related exception, if any, are contained within this Section
and no portion of Part 7 of Article XIV shall be applicable to a request
hereunder, unless it is specifically referenced in this section. Once such
conditional use is granted, all enforcement provisions of these regulations
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-7
shall apply to such nonconforming use.
(B) The owner of the property upon which such use exists must submit an
application for such conditional use to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(C) The application for such conditional use shall be made using the forms
provided by the Secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals, and shall contain
in complete form all information requested on the forms, as well as such
information as may be requested by the Secretary, or the Board. As part of
the application, the applicant shall be obligated to provide, at least, the
following information:
(1) A complete site plan showing all existing structures and improvements
on the property;
(2) A complete description of all existing uses on the property, including
the dates when such uses were established on the property in question;
(3) A site plan showing all proposed modifications, deletions, or additions
to structures, the site itself, or improvements thereon;
(4) A complete description of all proposed modifications to the existing
use(s) on the site;
(5) A complete and correct list of all owners of record of all property
located within 200 feet of the boundaries of the property on which the
nonconforming use is located; and
(6) The complete and correct legal description of the property on which the
nonconforming use is located.
(D) A hearing on the application shall be conducted, and notice given, by the
Board of Zoning Appeals in the same manner as hearings are conducted, and
notice given, for any other conditional use application.
(E) The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a conditional use or related
exception hereunder, unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific
written findings of fact, based upon the particular evidence presented to it,
that all the following standards have been met.
(1) That the size of the zoning lot is not increased from that which currently
exists;
(2) That either: (a) the current existing use does not have a significantly
adverse impact upon either the surrounding neighborhood or the public
health, safety or general welfare, and the proposed modifications,
ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMITIES
VIII-8
additions and deletions will not worsen such impact; or, (b) that the
current existing use does have such a significantly adverse impact and
the granting of the proposed modifications, additions and deletions will
be more likely to reduce or eliminate such impact than a denial of such
proposal;
(3) The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable provisions of
these regulations, except for those existing conditions that are legally
nonconforming; however, the proposal may contain requests for
exceptions to such requirements as provided in Paragraph (F)
hereinafter; and
(4) The existing use continues in a substantially similar form, or in a form
that is altered only to make it more modern or efficient.
(F) An applicant may request an exception as part of the conditional use, and the
Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an exception to these regulations as to
any of the following:
(1) Any bulk regulation.
(2) Any regulation dealing with signage.
(3) Any regulation dealing with parking.
(G) As a condition of granting a conditional use hereunder, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall require that, in the event the use upon the site changes to a use
permitted at that location by these regulations, the conditional use shall expire
and shall not be re-established.
(H) Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a conditional use and any related
exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions,
safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefited by the conditional use
or exception as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in
Paragraph (E), and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these
regulations. Failure to comply with all of the conditions, safeguards and
restrictions placed on a conditional use or exception shall constitute a
violation of these regulations.
(I) Decisions and Records. A final decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals
occurs upon the majority vote of the Board on the conditional use and
exception request at the public hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
9-101. Purpose and Objectives. The following regulations shall apply to land use and
structures within a Planned Unit Development District which, when approved by the
Planning Board and Governing Body, may differ in one or more respects from the
regulations that are applicable in any other zoning district, except the Flood Plain
District and Airport Overlay District. The objectives of a Planned Unit
Development District shall be to promote progressive development of land and
construction by encouraging Planned Unit Developments (PUD's) to achieve:
(A) A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing
and building types;
(B) A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if permitted as
part of the project, more convenience in the location of commercial uses and
services;
(C) A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and
geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents the
disruption of natural drainage patterns;
(D) A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through conventional
development;
(E) A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
facilities, and community facilities;
(F) An environment which provides safe, clean, convenient and necessary
residential, commercial, and industrial facilities which will afford greater
opportunities for better housing, recreation, shops and industrial plants for all
citizens of the community;
(G) A development plan which suits the specific needs of the site and takes into
account the unique conditions of the property which may require changes of
conventional bulk regulations, lot layout, or density; or results in a project that
provides greater public benefit than would be provided under conventional
zoning; and
(H) A mixture of compatible uses which might not otherwise be permitted in a
single district, or which may restrict the range of land uses more than in a
single district.
9-102. Provisions Governing Planned Unit Developments. Because of the special
IX-1
ARTICLE IX PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
characteristics of Planned Unit Developments, special provisions governing the
development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or
difference between the provisions of this Article and those of the other Articles of
these regulations or the Subdivision Regulations, the provisions of this Article shall
prevail for the development of land in Planned Unit Developments. Subjects not
covered by this Article shall be governed by the respective provisions found
elsewhere in these regulations.
9-103. General Standards for Planned Unit Developments Districts. The district is
designed to provide for the greatest amount of flexibility in the mixing of compatible
uses and the location and type of structures for those uses while setting aside
perpetual common use open space and facilities for owners, occupants and
customers in the district. Standards applicable to all PUD's are as follows:
(A) Permitted Uses: The applicant may propose any mixture of land uses,
including accessory and temporary uses. Temporary uses are generally
provided for under Section 5-201 of these regulations, unless they are
disallowed through the PUD zoning process.
(B) District Size: One-half acre for residential or commercial; one acre for
industrial; one acre if industrial is combined with either residential or
commercial. Manufactured Home Park developments shall be a minimum of
5 acres.
(C) Bulk Regulations including front, rear and side yard setbacks, and structure
height: Generally consistent with the existing zoning district on the proposed
site and adjacent property, but may be altered for a specific site as proposed
by the applicant.
(D) Maximum Lot Coverage: If a Planned Unit Development is strictly for any
one use, the total ground area occupied by structures for principal uses and
accessory uses should not exceed the following specified percentages of the
total ground area:
Residential 40 percent
Commercial 50 percent
Industrial 60 percent
A combination of any or all of these uses shall not exceed 50 percent of the
total ground area, except in the case of a Planned Unit Development located
within or adjacent to another zoning district which allows a greater coverage,
then the greater coverage allowances may apply.
(E) Signs: The applicant may propose a signage plan for the PUD and should
include any potential temporary signage.
IX-2
ARTICLE IX PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
(F) Parking: Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided for all uses
within the district in accordance with the requirements of Article 7 of these
regulations, unless it is determined by the Planning Board and Governing
Body that other parking ratios are more appropriate for a specific proposal.
(G) Guarantees: The following guarantees shall be provided by the applicant
prior to issuance of any building permits:
(1) Landscaping and underground irrigation approved with the Final
Development Plan shall be guaranteed by the applicant by providing a
bond, certificate of deposit, letter of credit, or the equivalent in order to
assure all landscaping and underground irrigation is installed.

ARTICLE X
FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
PART 1. PURPOSE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
10-101. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, and Statement of Purpose
(A) Statutory Authorization.
(1) Approval of Draft Ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer Prior to
Adoption.
The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were
approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water
Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on December 23,
2014.
(2) Kansas Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq. and
specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed
to protect the health, safety, and general welfare.
(B) Findings of Fact.
(1) Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation.
The special flood hazard areas of Manhattan, Kansas, are subject to
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(2) General Causes of the Flood Losses.
These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of
development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood
heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards.
ARTICLE X FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
X-2
The FEMA and Community Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified
in the effective Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Riley County and
Pottawatomie County, dated March 16, 2015, and its accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and local or FEMA approved revisions to the
FIRM and/or FIS which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this Article.
In areas where a Preliminary FIRM and Preliminary FIS exist, Community
Base Flood Elevations shown on the Preliminary FIRM and Preliminary FIS
shall be used for local regulatory purposes, if they are higher than those
shown on the effective FIRM and FIS.
The initial Flood Insurance Rate Maps are as follows for the jurisdictional
areas at the initial date:
City of Manhattan dated April 1, 1982.
Riley County Unincorporated Areas dated October 1, 1981.
Pottawatomie County Unincorporated Areas dated February 17, 1988.
The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the basis of this ordinance and uses a
standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of
a series of interrelated steps.
(a) Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations,
which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of
inundation. The base flood selected for this ordinance is
representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one (1%) percent chance of occurrence in any one
(1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS,
and illustrative materials dated March 16, 2015 as amended, and any
future revisions thereto.
(b) Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel
and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
(c) Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
(d) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
ARTICLE X FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
X-3
(e) Delineation of floodway fringe; i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
(C) Statement of Purpose.
(1) It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize flood losses resulting from periodic
inundation of the base flood by applying provisions designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or cause undue increases in flood heights
or velocities.
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time
of initial construction.
(c) Protect individuals from buying or leasing lands which are unsuited
for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
(d) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(e) Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
10-102. General Provisions.
(A) Official Floodplain Map.
(1) The Official Floodplain Map shall consist of the FIRM, Flood Insurance
Rate Map for Riley County, Kansas; Pottawatomie County, Kansas; and
Incorporated Areas, consisting of the Map Panels listed on Map Index
Sheet dated March 16, 2015, and any future revisions thereto, and the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance
Study for Riley County, Kansas; Pottawatomie County, Kansas; and
Incorporated Areas, dated March 16, 2015. The Official Floodplain Map
consists of the FEMA flood model and the community flood model. The
Official Floodplain Map shall also consist of all modifications or changes
to the above by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) The Official Floodplain Map shall apply to all land within the jurisdiction
of the City of Manhattan subject to the base flood.
ARTICLE X FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
X-4
(B) Floodplain Overlay Districts.
(1) The Official Floodplain Map shall be applied as two (2) overlay districts
for the purposes set forth in 10-101(C)(1)(a-e). Land uses not meeting
the development standards of this Article and those Articles of the
underlying zoning districts are prohibited.
(a) Floodway Overlay District (FW):
(1) The FW District boundaries are identified on the FIRM of as the
FEMA Floodway and shall be consistent with those boundaries.
(b) Floodway Fringe Overlay District (FF):
(1) The FF District boundaries are identified on the FIRM as
numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including A, AE, AO and
AH Zones), and Zone X (FUTURE CONDITIONS 1%
ANNUAL FLOOD HAZARD) and shall be consistent with
those boundaries.
(C) Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries.
(1) The boundaries of the Floodway and Floodway Fringe Overlay Districts
shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map and
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Where interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown
on the Official Zoning Map or FIRM, for example where there appears to
be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the
Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretations. The
base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor
in locating the district boundary on the land. Any person contesting the
location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to present their case to FEMA for an amendment or revision of the
boundary.
(D) Compliance.
(1) No development located within a FW or FF District shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with
the terms of this Article.
(E) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
(1) It is not intended by this Article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
Article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Article shall
ARTICLE X FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
X-5
prevail. All other Articles inconsistent with this Article are hereby
repealed to the extent of inconsistency only.
(F) Public Hearings Required By Regulatory Agencies.
(1) In the event FEMA, the Kansas Department of Agriculture, or any other
regulatory agency having jurisdiction over matters covered by this Article
requires the City to conduct a public hearing related to such matters, and
the method by which such public hearing is to be conducted is not
prescribed by such agency or elsewhere in these regulations, such method
shall be as follows:
(a) Written notice of such hearing shall be mailed at least 20 days before
the hearing to all affected property owners. The Floodplain
Administrator may require any applicant to provide the City with a
list of the names and addresses of all affected property owners.
(b) Notice of such hearing shall be published once in the official City
newspaper at least 20 days prior to the hearing.
(c) The Floodplain Administrator may request the Manhattan Urban
Area Planning Board to review the matter prior to the public hearing
if the public hearing is to be conducted by the Governing Body.
(G) Use of Other Base Flood Data in Identified Floodplains Where Base Flood
Elevations Have Not Been Established.
(1) When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
Section 10-102(A)(1), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review,
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from federal, state or other sources as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall
comply with the requirements of this Article.
(2) If a floodway has not been designated, no development, including
sanitary landfills, shall be permitted within the Floodplain, unless it is
demonstrated by the developer that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, as shown in the Future Land Use Map of the
Comprehensive Plan, other area planning studies or approved
development plan, will not increase the base flood elevation by more than
one (1) foot on the average cross section of the reach in which the
development is located as shown on the Flood Insurance Study.
(3) Any use of data required in this section which would alter the location of
the Floodplain, FW District or FF District shall be subject to the
ARTICLE X FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
X-6
additional requirements of Section 10-102(E).
10-103. Administration.
(A) The Zoning Administrator, or his/her designee, shall serve as the Floodplain
Administrator and shall administer, enforce and implement the provisions of
this Article.
(B) Duties of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but are not limited to,
the following:
(1) Review all Floodplain Development Permits for proposed development
to assure that sites are reasonably safe from flooding and that the
floodplain development requirements of this Article have been
satisfied.
(2) Review Floodplain Development Permits for proposed development to
assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from federal, state,
or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.

documents for this article, which can be amended administratively, as
needed.
10-104. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study.
Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway
fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free
from flooding or flood damage. This Article shall not create liability on the part of
the City of Manhattan or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
may result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

XII-13
ARTICLE XII TELECOM STRUCTURES
12-114. Stealth Design Principles for Telecom Structures
Stealth telecom structures shall be designed to blend in with the character and
environment of the area in which they are proposed to be located, and to enhance
compatibility with nearby land uses by minimizing visual impacts. Stealth telecom
structures shall incorporate the following design principles, as applicable to the type of
telecom structure and character of the location:
(A) Preserve the pre-existing character of the area as much as possible.
(B) Minimize the height, mass and proportion of telecom structures to minimize
impacts on the character of the nearby area.
(C) Minimize the silhouette presented by new towers, stealth monopoles, antenna
support structures and antenna arrays. Monopoles are favored over lattice-type
towers; antennas mounted inside an antenna support structure or monopole, or
mounted flush to the antenna support structure, are favored over triangular tophat
or other projecting external types of antenna arrays.
(D) Use colors, textures and materials that blend in with the existing environment;
surfaces shall be painted, or otherwise treated, to match or complement existing
background structures and surfaces, and to minimize reflection.
(E) Conceal telecommunication facilities from view by placing inside a building,
steeple, penthouse, clock tower, flagpole or other appropriate structure.
Architectural additions or appurtenances to existing antenna support structures
that are intended to conceal telecommunication facilities, shall be designed to be
appropriate in mass, scale, material, texture, color and character with the existing
antenna support structure.
(F) Camouflage and/or disguise telecom structures to look like another type of
structure or object, through methods including, but not limited to design,
placement, use of materials, texture, color, year-round landscaping and screening,
to blend in with the character of the surroundings, or integrate into the
architectural elements and character of an existing antenna support structure to
such an extent that it is indistinguishable by the casual observer from the structure
on which it is located, or from the surroundings in which it is placed. Stealth
monopoles designed to look like a flagpole shall utilize a flag that is appropriately
sized for the height of the pole. Stealth monopoles disguised as a tree shall be of
a height, character and placement that is appropriate to the location. Telecom
structures mounted on roofs or similar structures shall be concealed from view by
XII-14
ARTICLE XII TELECOM STRUCTURES

the original recommendation and proceed accordingly.

Governing Body, by simple majority thereof, may adopt, or may revise or
amend and adopt, such recommendation by ordinance, or it need take no

recommendation and address the matters required by Section 15-403, even if
they take no further action thereon.

disapproval of a zoning amendment, if a valid protest petition against such
amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days
after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing which was commenced
pursuant to the publication notice, the ordinance adopting such amendment
shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the
Governing Body. Such protest petition, in order to be valid, shall be signed by
all owners of record of twenty percent (20%) or more of any real property
proposed to be rezoned, or by all the owners of record of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the total real property within the area required to be notified
of the proposed rezoning of a specific property, excluding streets and public

zoning amendment was requested by the owner of the specific property
subject to the rezoning, or the owner of the specific property subject to the
rezoning does not oppose in writing such zoning amendment, such property

regulations and affects specific property, they shall address the following
matters:
(1) the existing use of the property;
(2) the physical and environmental characteristics of the property;
(3) the zoning and land uses of nearby properties;
(4) the suitability of the subject property for the land uses to which it is
restricted under current zoning;
(5) the character of the neighborhood;
(6) the compatibility of the proposed zoning district with nearby properties
and the extent to which it may detrimentally affect those properties;

purpose of these regulations;
XV-6

public services exist, or can be provided to serve the uses that would be
permitted by the proposed zoning district;

(B) In addition to the matters set forth in subparagraph (A), the Governing Body
shall also consider the recommendation of the Planning Board.
(C) In approving or disapproving such a proposed amendment, the Planning
Board and the Governing Body shall set forth, on the record, their reasons for
such action, as they pertain to each of the matters set forth above. Such
Bodies may incorporate, as their reasons, any information contained in the
report of the Planning Staff prepared pursuant to Section 15-303. The failure
of the Planning Board or Governing Body to specifically address any matters
set forth above shall raise the presumption that their reasons, as to the matter,
are as contained in said report.

6-102. INFORMATION PACKETS.
Information packets concerning the subdivision process, meeting schedules
and application forms are available at the responsible Planning Department.
PART 2. PRE-APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE.
6-201. Prior to submitting an application for the review and approval of a
Preliminary Plat, the subdivider shall contact the responsible Planning
Department to arrange for a Pre-Application Development Conference, and
such Planning Department shall schedule same, subject to Section 5-101 (B)
(1-3).
VI-1
The Pre-Application Development Conference is the beginning step in the
review of any subdivision and shall be mandatory for any proposal. The
conference shall include, but is not limited to, the subdivider or an appointed
designee and representatives of the responsible Planning and Engineering
Departments, and other appropriate departments. The Pre-Application
Development Conference shall be an informal review of the proposal and the
subdivider shall bring to the Pre-Application Development Conference a
Sketch Plat, prepared in accordance with Section 7-101, and when
applicable, a Concept Plat as required by Section 6-301 (B) (2) herein. The
subdivider shall also bring to the Pre-Application Development Conference
information in the form of drawings and/or legal descriptions which
identifies all unplatted land contiguous to the proposed subdivision, and
which is in the same ownership as the proposed subdivision. The subdivider
shall also bring information regarding any benefit districts, to which the
proposed tract is subject, and which have been created by the City of
Manhattan. Such information shall include a rough draft of the plan
regarding special assessments, required by Section 6-302. The purpose of
the conference is to acquaint the subdivider with the application submittal
process; to identify any accompanying studies, documents or reports that
should be submitted; to provide an exchange of information regarding the
proposed development; and, to advise the subdivider about policies and
regulations that create opportunities or pose constraints on the proposed
development. No official approval or disapproval of a proposal occurs with
this step. A development conference shall have effect for only six (6)
months. If no Preliminary Plat, Lot Split or Boundary Line Adjustment
action has been filed within six (6) months of the conference, the subdivider
shall hold another conference, unless an extension is granted by the
responsible Planning Department.
6-202. In the event any factor of the proposed subdivision, which in the judgement
of the responsible Planning Department, necessitates review, and comment,
by an Advisory Board, other than the MUAPB, such review and comment
shall occur prior to the submittal of an application for a Preliminary Plat.
The subdivider shall submit all necessary information to such Board for such
review and comment.
PART 3. APPLICATION, REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY AND
CONCEPT PLATS.
6-301. (A) The subdivider shall submit an application, on forms provided by the
responsible Planning Department, for the review, and approval, of a
Preliminary Plat. The responsible Planning Department may
administratively provide for submission deadlines for materials
required in support of an application provided for in these Regulations.
VI-2
(1) If the tract of land, proposed to be subdivided, is located within
the corporate limits of the City, the application shall be submitted
to the responsible Planning Department.
(2) If the tract of land, proposed to be subdivided, is located within
the Urban Service Area, the application shall be submitted to the
Departments of both the City and County, responsible for
planning and zoning. Such Departments shall coordinate between
themselves the primary responsibility for reviewing such
applications.
(3) If the tract of land, proposed to be subdivided, is located in the
Urban Area, the application shall be submitted to the responsible
Planning Department.
(B) The following documents, where applicable, shall be attached to the
application:
(1) The proposed Preliminary Plat, and information, as set forth in
Article VII of these Regulations.
(2) A Concept Plat, when required, as follows:
(a) Upon submittal of a Preliminary Plat, the subdivider shall
submit a Concept Plat, addressing land contiguous to the
proposed subdivision, and in the same ownership as the
proposed subdivision. The responsible Planning
Department, subsequent to the Pre-Application
Development Conference, shall determine the scope, and
extent, of such contiguous land that is required to be
addressed by the Concept Plat. In determining such scope,
and extent, the responsible Planning Department may
consider such factors as the size of the area contiguous to
the proposed subdivision, the topography of such area, the
Manhattan Urban Area boundaries, the time within which
such area is likely to develop, and such other factors as the
responsible Planning Department deems reasonable. The
responsible Planning Department shall notify the
subdivider of such scope, and extent, as soon as possible
after the Pre-Application Development Conference. A
Concept Plat shall be submitted, even if a prior Concept
Plat, covering some, or all, of the same area, has been
previously submitted with a prior Preliminary Plat. A
Concept Plat shall be considered an informal review of
contiguous land. The purpose of the Concept Plat is solely
to allow the MUAPB to receive and exchange information
VI-3
from the subdivider about future development of the
contiguous land during its formative stages.
(b) The Concept Plat shall be prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Article VII, Part 1, Section 7-101 (1-13).
(c) The MUAPB shall not be entitled to base any decision
about the Preliminary Plat upon information contained in
the Concept Plat and neither the MUAPB nor the
subdivider shall be bound by any information on the
Concept Plat as to the future development of the area which
it represents.
6-302. (A) Upon receipt of a complete application for the review and approval of a
Preliminary Plat, the responsible Planning Department shall schedule the
application for Public Hearing before the MUAPB. Such Hearing shall not
be scheduled sooner than thirty (30) days subsequent to the receipt of the
complete application. After such Hearing date has been established, the
responsible Planning Department shall proceed with the publication of a
public notice for a Public Hearing before the MUAPB, as prescribed herein.
(B) If the tract of land proposed to be subdivided is subject to special
assessments imposed by the City of Manhattan, no application for a
Preliminary Plat regarding such tract shall be deemed complete until the
subdivider has submitted a plan, and said plan has been approved by the
Citys Planning Department, which sets forth the manner in which such
special assessments are to be re-apportioned upon the tract, as platted. Such
plan, as submitted for approval, shall include the written approval of all
owners of the tract and shall be consistent with the original resolution
creating the benefit district and the ordinance levying the special
assessments. If, after such plan has been approved, the proposed Preliminary
Plat is modified, such Preliminary Plat shall not be approved until the plan
has been resubmitted, and approved by the Citys Planning Department.
6-303. Public Hearing. The MUAPB shall conduct a Public Hearing on any
application for a Preliminary Plat. A Notice of Public Hearing shall be
advertised once in the official City/County newspaper and at least twenty
(20) days shall elapse between the date of publication and the date set for the
Public Hearing. Such notice shall state the date, time and place of the Public
Hearing and a general description of the proposed subdivision.
6-304. Area of Notification. Notice of the Public Hearing shall be mailed at least
twenty (20) days before the hearing to all owners of record of land within
two hundred (200) feet of the area proposed to be platted. If the area to be
platted is located adjacent to or outside the Citys limits, the area of
VI-4
notification shall extend to one thousand (1,000) feet in the unincorporated
area.
6-305. Posting of Signs for Public Hearings Involving Specific Property.
(A)For parcels in the City and Urban Service Area, the subdivider shall
place a sign on the property informing the general public that a Public
Hearing will be held concerning the proposed change. The sign shall be
furnished by the City, and the subdivider shall maintain the sign for at
least twenty (20) days immediately preceding the date of the Public
Hearing. The sign shall be firmly attached to a stake and placed within 5
feet of the street right-of-way line in a central position on the lot, tract or
parcel of land, so that the sign is free of any visual obstructions
surrounding the sign. If a lot, tract or parcel of land is located on a
corner, one sign shall be placed so as to face each of the streets abutting
thereto. If the lot, tract or parcel of land does not have a yard in which to
place a sign, a sign may be posted in the window of the building in such
a manner that it is free of visual obstructions. The responsible Planning
Department may waive the requirement to post a sign, in cases where a
lot, tract or parcel of land is not accessible to the publics view.
(B) The subdivider shall file an affidavit with the responsible Planning
Department on the day of the Public Hearing verifying that the sign has
been maintained and posted as required by this paragraph. The sign may
be removed at the conclusion of the Public Hearing and must be removed
by the applicant at the end of all proceedings on the application or upon
withdrawal of the application. Failure to post the sign(s) in accordance
with these procedures, or failure to submit the affidavit prior to the
hearing may result in a delay of the Public Hearing.
6-306. Consideration of Preliminary Plats.
(A)The MUAPB shall approve the Preliminary Plat if:
(1) The proposed Preliminary Plat conforms with the requirements of
these Regulations; and,
(2) There is no indication from providers of public facilities, or
services, that their facilities, or services, will not be available to
the platted area within a reasonable period of time. For the
purposes of this Section, public facilities and services shall
include, but are not limited to sanitary sewer, water, streets, storm
sewer, fire protection, police protection, schools, electricity, and
phone service; and,
VI-5
(3) The Plat conforms to all requirements established by the MUAPB
pursuant to Subsection 6-306 (B); and,
(4) The proposed plat presents an overall development pattern that is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and policies adopted by
the responsible Governing Body, and,
(5) The plat contains a sound, well-conceived parcel and land
subdivision layout that is consistent with good land planning, site
engineering design principles, and the requirements of Article X,
Subdivision Layout Standards, and,
(6) The spacing and layout of proposed streets, curb cuts, intersection
locations, medians, and the number and location of ingress and
egress points to the land covered by the plat are consistent with
good traffic engineering design and public safety considerations,
and,
(7) The subdivider has made every reasonable effort to mitigate the
impact of the proposed subdivision on the public health, safety and
general welfare, including off-site impacts caused by increased
traffic volume and altered traffic flow.
(B) In the event the MUAPB determines that there are physical
characteristics of the parcel proposed to be platted, which create
circumstances that significantly, and adversely, impact the general
health, safety and welfare of the future users of the site, or other areas,
and such circumstances are not adequately addressed by these
Regulations, but reasonably would have been, if they had been known or
considered at the time of adoption of these Regulations, then the
MUAPB may either impose conditions upon the plat approval or deny
the plat, whichever is reasonably necessary to address such
circumstances.
(C) Prior to the approval of a Preliminary Plat, the MUAPB may require the
subdivider to submit an engineering study of the impact of a flood on
any flood prone area not delineated as a Floodway or Floodway Fringe
District. Flood-prone areas are those that include, but are not necessarily
limited to, those that have a history of flooding due to natural storm
events and/or manmade conditions, or any combination thereof. The
MUAPB shall review the plat to determine if the subdivision proposal
will be reasonably safe from flooding and may impose construction
standards consistent with the need to protect those flood-prone areas
identified in the study. In order to be reasonably safe, residential
development shall be constructed on non-settling fill so that the lowest
enclosed floor, including a basement of the dwelling would be at least
VI-6
one (1) foot above the flood elevation determined by the concurrent
engineering study. In order to be reasonably safe, commercial or
industrial development may be constructed on non-settling fill so that
the lowest enclosed floor is at least one (1) foot above the determined
flood elevation, or flood proofed to at least one (1) foot above the
determined flood elevation. The MUAPB shall review the plat to assure
that:
(1) The proposed plat is consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage within the flood-prone area; and,
(2) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical,
water and streets are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and,
(3) Adequate drainage easements are provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
(D) The MUAPB may deny a plat in unique circumstances where the facts
indicate that due to frequency or severity of flooding, flood depths, or
flood velocities, the proposed plat cannot provide lots that are safe from
the effects of flooding.
(E) (1) If the MUAPB disapproves, or approves conditionally, the
Preliminary Plat, the reasons for such shall be stated in writing
and shall refer specifically to those parts of these Regulations
with which the Preliminary Plat does not conform. A copy of
such writing, signed by the Secretary of the MUAPB, shall be
delivered to the applicant.
(2) If the MUAPB fails to take action to approve, disapprove or
conditionally approve the Preliminary Plat within ninety (90)
days after the date of the first Public Hearing on said Preliminary
Plat, the Preliminary Plat shall be deemed approved, as
submitted, unless the MUAPB, for good reasons stated, extends
such time frame for a period not to exceed an additional ninety
(90) days. If the MUAPB fails to take such action within the
extended period, the Preliminary Plat shall be deemed approved,
as submitted.
(3) When a Preliminary Plat is approved with conditions, the
subdivider shall provide the responsible Planning Department
with a revised Preliminary Plat, consistent with the conditions set
forth by the MUAPB, prior to the submission of the Final Plat to
the MUAPB.
VI-7
(4) Once approved, a Preliminary Plat shall be marked indicating it
has been approved by the MUAPB. If the Preliminary Plat has
been revised pursuant to Subsection (3), the responsible Planning
Department shall determine if it is in compliance with the
requirements of the MUAPB and shall mark the revised
Preliminary Plat accordingly.
(5) Approval of the Preliminary Plat by the MUAPB does not
constitute final acceptance of the subdivision, but is merely an
authorization to proceed to the preparation of the Final Plat.
6-307. Effective Period of Preliminary Approval.
(A) The approval of a Preliminary Plat shall be effective for a period of two
(2) years. Upon written request by the subdivider, made before the
expiration of the period, the MUAPB may extend the period of
effectiveness for another period of two (2) years.
(B) The subdivider shall submit an application for approval of a Final Plat
within the period of effectiveness, including any authorized extensions
thereof for the Preliminary Plat. If no such application is filed within the
period of effectiveness, the approval of the Preliminary Plat shall be
automatically deemed to have been withdrawn. For good cause shown,
the MUAPB may allow the reinstatement of such approval. In the event
such approval is withdrawn, and not reinstated, the proposed
subdivision, in order to be approved, must be reprocessed as a
Preliminary Plat pursuant to these Regulations. In the event an
application requests approval of a Final Plat, for only a portion of the
area covered by the Preliminary Plat, and such request is approved, the
original Preliminary Plat shall be deemed to be considered in phases.
Upon approval of such a Final Plat, the approved portion shall be Phase
1, and the balance of the Preliminary Plat shall be considered Phase 2.
The period of effectiveness for the approval of Phase 2 shall be a period
of two (2) years, commencing on the date of approval of the Final Plat of
Phase 1. The process for the approval of a Final Plat for Phase 2 shall be
the same as for the original Preliminary Plat, including, but not limited
to any request for an extension of the period of effectiveness, and
including the continued phasing of Phase 2, into more phases.
(C) Notwithstanding the period of effectiveness established in Subparagraph
(A) or (B) of this Section, every plat shall conform to existing Zoning
Regulations and Subdivision Regulations applicable at the time of Final
Plat approval, except that any such plat shall be exempt from any
subsequent amendments to the Zoning Regulations rendering the
Preliminary Plat, as approved, nonconforming as to bulk, lot size or use
regulations, provided that the Final Plat approval is obtained within the
VI-8
period of effective approval of the Preliminary Plat.
PART 4. APPLICATION, REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF FINAL PLATS.
6-401. (A) Following approval of a Preliminary Plat, the subdivider may submit an
application for review and approval of a Final Plat, within the period of
effectiveness as described in Section 6-307 (A) and (B), on forms provided
by the responsible Planning Department. Following approval of a Final
Plat, a subdivider may at any time, submit an application for a Replat of all,
or a portion, of the parcel controlled by said Final Plat. An application for a
Replat shall be treated in the same manner as a Final Plat, except no
application for a Replat shall be deemed complete if all, or any portion, of
the tract proposed to be Replatted is subject to special assessments imposed
by the City of Manhattan, until the subdivider submits the plan, and said
plan is approved by the Citys Planning Department, as required by Section
6-302.
(B) The following documents, where applicable, shall be attached to the
application:
(1) The Final Plat, and included information, all as set forth in
Article VII of these Regulations.
6-402. Review of Application for Final Plat by Responsible Planning Department.
(A) Upon receipt of an application for approval of a Final Plat, the responsible
Planning Department shall review such application to determine if, in the
opinion of such Planning Department, the Final Plat substantially conforms
with the Preliminary Plat, as approved by the MUAPB, including
conformance with any conditions and requirements imposed by the
MUAPB; and, that the Final Plat complies with all requirements of these
Regulations, currently in effect. If the responsible Planning Department
determines the Final Plat so conforms, and complies, the Planning
Department shall place approval of such Final Plat on the agenda of a
meeting of the MUAPB in compliance with these Regulations. If the
responsible Planning Department determines that the Final Plat does not
conform, or does not comply, the Planning Department shall notify the
subdivider of the discrepancies and of the action necessary to obtain
conformance and compliance. Upon receipt of such notification, the
subdivider may:
(1) Undertake to take the action suggested by the Planning
Department and resubmit the application for approval of
the Final Plat when such action is complete; or,
(2) If the Planning Department has found that the Final Plat
VI-9
does not substantially comply with the Preliminary Plat, but
that it is in compliance with these Regulations, currently in
effect, the subdivider may request that the application for
appproval be scheduled with the MUAPB in order that the
Board can determine such conformance. The subdivider
may also request that the application for approval of the
Final Plat be considered, in the alternative, as an
application for approval of a Preliminary/Final Plat in one
action. If the subdivider makes such a request, the
requirements of Public Hearing and notice, as set forth in
Sections 6-303, 6-304 and 6-305 shall apply.
(B) The Final Plat shall be deemed submitted to the Secretary of the MUAPB
when the responsible Planning Department determines that it is in
substantial conformance with the Preliminary Plat and it complies with
these Regulations, or when the subdivider makes a written request
pursuant to Subsection (A)(2) above.
6-403. Review of Final Plat.
(A)The MUAPB shall approve the Final Plat if it is in substantial
conformance with the Preliminary Plat, as approved, including all
requirements and conditions placed upon such Preliminary Plat by the
MUAPB; and, the Final Plat complies with all requirements of these
Regulations as of the date of such final approval.
(B) The MUAPB shall determine if the Final Plat substantially conforms
with the Preliminary Plat, and if it complies with these Regulations,
within sixty (60) days after the first meeting of the MUAPB following
the date of submission of such Final Plat to the Secretary of the MUAPB
pursuant to Section 6-402 (B). If such determination is not made within
said period, the Final Plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless
the subdivider has agreed, in writing, to an extension of such period.
(C) If the MUAPB determines that the Final Plat is in substantial
conformance to the Preliminary Plat and that it complies with these
Regulations, there shall be endorsed on the Final Plat the fact that it has
been submitted to, and approved by, the MUAPB. If the Final Plat is
deemed to be approved pursuant to Subsection (B) above, a certificate
indicating such approval shall be issued by the Secretary, upon demand.
(D)If events have occurred, subsequent to the approval of the Preliminary
Plat, which raise issues that the MUAPB believes should be addressed
pursuant to section 6-306 (B) or 6-306 (C), the MUAPB may make such
requirements, as are permitted by those Sections, prior to approval of the
Final Plat.
VI-10
(E) If the MUAPB determines that the Final Plat does not comply with these
Regulations, or does not conform to the Preliminary Plat, or both, the
MUAPB may deny approval of such Final Plat. In such event, the
MUAPB shall set forth, in writing, its order of denial, which shall also
specifically set forth the factors the MUAPB relied upon in making such
determination.
(F) If the MUAPB enters an order denying approval of a Final Plat, it may
also set a period of time, within which, the subdivider may resubmit the
Final Plat, with amendments thereto, for reconsideration by the
MUAPB.
6-404. Governing Body Action.
(A)Before a Final Plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the responsible
Governing Body for consideration of the acceptance of streets and other
public ways, service and utility easements, and land dedicated for public
use. When within the corporate limits of the City, acceptance of
dedications shall be shown over the signature of the Mayor or any other
City official duly authorized to act during the absence or disability of the
Mayor and attested to by the City Clerk. When a Final Plat is located in
the unincorporated areas (i.e. Urban Service Areas or Urban Area) of the
County, it shall be submitted to the County Commissioners for
acceptance of dedications. Acceptance shall be shown over the
signatures of the County Commission and attested to by the County
Clerk.
(B)The responsible Governing Body shall accept or refuse the dedication of
land for public purposes within thirty (30) days after the first regularly
scheduled meeting of said Body, following the date of official submission
of the Final Plat to the said Bodys Clerk by the Secretary of the
MUAPB. The responsible Governing Body may defer action for an
additional thirty (30) days for the purpose of allowing for modifications
to such dedications in order to comply with the requirements established
by said Body.
(C) If the Governing body defers or refuses any such dedication, it shall
advise the subdivider and the MUAPB of the reasons therefore. Such
reasons shall be solely related to the ownership, improvement,
maintenance, and use of such dedicated land.
(D) No Final Plat shall be filed of record, or be effective, if it contains
dedications of land to the public that have not been accepted by the
responsible Governing Body.
VI-11
PART 5. APPLICATION, REVIEW, AND APPROVAL OF CONCURRENT PLAT.
6-501. Application Requirements and Approval Procedure. Whenever a subdivision
will consist of five (5) or fewer lots, the subdivider may submit an
application for the concurrent approval of a Preliminary and Final Plat. Such
application shall be on forms provided by the responsible Planning
Department. The application shall contain all the documents required for
both Preliminary Plats and Final Plats and shall be reviewed, simultaneously,
in the same manner required for Preliminary and Final Plats.
PART 6. RECORDING OF PLAT.
6-601. Upon approval of a Final Plat, and acceptance of all dedications by the
appropriate Governing Body, and upon submission of all documents required
to be submitted with a Final Plat, the responsible Planning Department shall
file the Final Plat with the appropriate Register of Deeds. If all documents,
required to be submitted with a Final Plat, have not been submitted within
one (1) year of the date upon which the appropriate Governing Body
accepted the dedications, or within one (1) year of the approval of the Final
Plat, whichever date is later, the approval of such Final Plat shall be deemed
to have been withdrawn and such Final Plat shall not be filed until it has
been submitted again for approval.
PART 7. APPLICATION, REVIEW, AND APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS AND
BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENTS
6-701. (A) The responsible Planning Department is hereby authorized to review,
and either approve or disapprove, both Lot Splits and Boundary Line
Adjustments, in accordance with these Regulations.
(B) Applications for either Lot Splits or Boundary Line Adjustments shall be
submitted to the responsible Planning Department, on forms provided by

land surveyor, licensed in the State of Kansas, showing the lot(s)
involved, the precise location of all structures and easements thereon,
the location of all streets and rights-of-ways, and location and
dimensions of all boundary lines, as they currently exist, and, as they are
proposed. Such Application shall also identify any restrictive covenants
that are applicable to the property involved.
6-702 Consideration of Lot Splits.
(A) The responsible Planning Department shall approve an application for
a Lot Split if the application requests the dividing of a lot into two (2)
lots, and the original lot has not been previously split, and both new
lots conform to the requirements of these Regulations. The
VI-12
responsible Planning Department may approve an application for a Lot
Split that requests the dividing of a lot into more than two (2) lots if, in
the opinion of the responsible Planning Department, the proposed split
does not create lots that are out of character with the original
subdivision, and all new lots conform to the requirements of these
Regulations.
(B) No Lot Split shall be approved if:
(1) A vacation, modification or addition, of streets, alleys, setback
lines, access control or easement is required or proposed.
(2) An installation of a public facility is required or proposed.
(3) The lot split will result in a lot without access to a street or to
adequate services or which cannot meet flood plain requirements.
(4) A substandard sized lot will be created according to applicable
Zoning Regulations or sanitary code.
(5) A newly created lot will not comply with these Regulations.
(6) Any newly created lot will be in violation of any applicable
restrictive covenants filed of record. (The responsible Planning
Department shall be entitled to rely upon the information
provided by the applicant regarding the existence of such
restrictive covenants.)
(7) Any other factor which, in the opinion of the responsible Planning
Department, fails to comply with the intent and purpose of
existing land development regulations and Governing Body
policies.
(C) No building permit shall be issued for a lot created by a Lot Split until the
Lot Split has been approved by the responsible Planning Department.
(D) The Director, or their designee, of the responsible Planning Department
shall either approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the Lot
Split within 30 days after submittal of the application. Upon approval of
a Lot Split, the applicant shall prepare a Lot Split Survey, as described in
Section 7-401 of these Regulations.
6-703. Consideration of Boundary Line Adjustments.
(A) The responsible Planning Department may approve a Boundary Line
Adjustment, if, in the opinion of the responsible Planning Department
VI-13
the Boundary Line Adjustment does not create lots that are out of
character with the original subdivision, and all lots, after the Boundary
Line Adjustment, conform to the requirements of these Regulations.
(B) No Boundary Line Adjustment shall be approved if:
(1) The adjustment causes one, or both, lots to be substandard sized
lots, according to applicable Zoning Regulations or sanitary code.
(2) The adjustment causes one, or both, lots to not comply with these
Regulations.
(3) The adjustment causes one, or both lots to be in violation of any
applicable restrictive covenants filed of record. (The responsible
Planning Department shall be entitled to rely upon the
information provided by the applicant regarding the existence of
such restrictive covenants.)
(4) The adjustment causes any other factor which, in the opinion of
the responsible Planning Department, fails to comply with the
intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and
Governing Body policies.
(C) The Director, or their designee, of the responsible Planning
Department shall either approve, approve with conditions, or
disapprove the Boundary Line Adjustment within 30 days after
submittal of the application. Upon approval of a Boundary Line
Adjustment, the applicant shall prepare a Boundary Line Adjustment
Survey, as described in Section 7-402 of these Regulations.

existing development on the site (land use types and intensities
and the arrangement of buildings, parking and access).
(b) Identify the functional classification of the public street(s) to be
accessed.
(c) Document current public street characteristics (number and
types of lanes, speed limits or 85th percentile speeds, and sight
distances along the public street from proposed access).
(d) Compare proposed access with established design criteria
(typically driveway spacing, alignment with other streets and
driveways, width of driveway, and minimum sight distances).
(e) Determine number of trips generated by the existing and
proposed development - daily and peak hours - using the latest
edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers. Local trip generation characteristics
may be used if deemed to be properly collected and consistent
with the subject development application. Calculate the net
difference in trips between existing and proposed uses.
VII-6
(f) Document the current peak hour traffic volumes at each
proposed access driveway on a typical weekday (Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday). Traffic volumes should be measured on
the public street(s) and at any existing site driveway(s). The
time periods in which existing traffic is counted should
generally coincide with the highest combination of existing
traffic plus traffic expected to be generated by the proposed
development.
(g) Distribute and assign the net development trips through the site
driveway(s).
(h) Conduct volume/capacity analyses for peak hours at site
driveway intersections using methodologies outlined in the
latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published by the
Transportation Research Board. The analyses should be
conducted for both existing conditions and existing plus
development conditions.
(i) Compare existing plus development conditions with established
guidelines/policies for acceptable levels of service and turn
lanes.
(j) Identify geometric and traffic control improvements to mitigate
deficiencies and/or comply with established guidelines/policies.
(k) Prepare a typewritten report outlining the findings and
conclusions of the study, including exhibits illustrating the site
plan, traffic volumes and existing street conditions.
(l) Possible Additional Requirements:
(1) Extend the study to other street segments and/or
intersections on the public street system.
(2) Compare the traffic impacts of the proposed land use
with the traffic impacts of the land use in the
comprehensive land use plan.
(3) Evaluate future (20-year) conditions.
(4) Extend the study to include peak periods outside the
typical weekday commuter periods (i.e., A.M. ad P.M.
peak periods). For example, Saturday in areas with
significant retail development.
VII-7
(8) Notwithstanding that the responsible City or County Engineer may
waive the requirement for submittal of a drainage report and plan
and/or a Transportation Impact Study, the MUAPB may require
submittal of a drainage report and plan and/or Transportation Impact
Study, prior to taking action on an application. Any decision by the
MUAPB to require such submittal shall be final.

SUBDIVISION LAYOUT STANDARDS
PART 1. GENERAL STANDARDS.
10-101. Scope. All subdivision plats shall be prepared in conformity with the standards set
forth herein. The layout, and location, of areas on plats proposed to be dedicated to
the public for uses such as streets, storm and sanitary sewerage systems, water supply
systems and other utilities shall also be consistent with the standards for such public
improvements that may be adopted by the applicable Governing Body or the
applicable Engineering Department.
10-102. Policy and Plan Coordination. All subdivision plats shall conform with the
applicable adopted Comprehensive Plans and policies of the City of Manhattan or
Riley County.
10-103. Access. All lots located on a subdivision plat shall directly abut, and be served
directly by a public street or travel easement.
10-104. Flood Plain Areas. All subdivision plats shall conform to the requirements of the
Flood Plain Regulations of the Manhattan Zoning Ordinance, or the Zoning
Regulations of Riley County, Kansas, whichever is applicable.
10-105. Land Subject to Erosion. On land subject to excessive soil movement that may result
in erosion or deposition of soil, the MUAPB in accordance with the City or County
Engineer's recommendations, may require necessary preventive measures as part of
the Preliminary or Final Plat approval. All provisions of the Environmental
Protection Agencys National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
storm water regulations shall be followed.
10-106. Subdivision Name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too
closely approximate in sound or spelling, any existing subdivision in either Riley
County or Pottawatomie County.
10-107. Conformance to Applicable Laws and Regulations. In addition to the requirements
established herein, all subdivision plats, where applicable, shall comply with the
following laws and regulations:
(A) The City or County Zoning Regulations, respectively;
(B) The Riley County Health Department's regulations;
(C) The regulations of the Kansas State Department of Transportation if the
subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state highway;

(F) The standards and regulations utilized by the City/County Engineer,
respectively;
(G) Where there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted
herein and those contained in the above official regulations, the more restrictive
standard shall apply; and,
(H) Any other applicable statutory provisions.
PART 2. STREET STANDARDS.
10-201. Introduction.
(A) It is the goal and the responsibility of these Regulations to provide for a safe,
convenient, adequate, and comprehensively planned street system that provides
for all forms of transportation including motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.
The system should coordinate and provide connections for bicycles and
pedestrians that are an integral part of the overall transportation network. The
system should be logical and respect the natural features of the community. The
specific standards applicable to the system must address the specific needs of the
users related to the functional classification of the particular street, and bicycle
and pedestrian connections to that system.
(B) Street Classification. Streets are classified according to their function as defined
by these Regulations. Streets shall generally consist of arterial, collector and
local streets.
(C) General Requirements:
(1) The layout of streets on subdivision plats shall be consistent with the
applicable standards adopted by the respective Governing Bodies. Within
the City and the Urban Service Area, the City of Manhattans Design
Standards and Specifications shall be the applicable standard. Within the
Urban Area, The Specifications For Streets Construction And Design,
Subdivision Regulations of Riley County shall apply. In addition, such
layout of streets shall, where applicable, be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, Functional Street Classification Map, Bicycle
Master Plan, Manhattan Linear Park Phase II Master Plan and all other
adopted Plans of the applicable Governing Body.
(2) In order to promote connectivity to adjacent properties, every plat shall
provide multiple access points, to the greatest extent possible. Streets in a
proposed subdivision must connect, where feasible, to existing streets in
X-2
abutting platted subdivisions, and streets must be continued to the
boundaries of the tract being platted, such that future abutting subdivisions
may be connected, unless the MUAPB finds that the minimum
requirements are not reasonable, due to the topography or other existing
physical conditions of the site; or, if the MUAPB finds that such minimum
requirements are not necessary, or desirable, for coordination of the
subdivisions layout with existing adjoining layouts, or the most
advantageous future layouts of adjoining tracts. In making findings that
the minimum requirements are not required, the MUAPB shall consider
the recommendations of the applicable Fire Department.
10-202. STANDARDS REGARDING TOPOGRAPHY AND ARRANGEMENT OF
STREETS.
(A) Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to match the
existing topography, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to
require the minimum number of streets for providing safe and efficient access to
property. Streets shall not intersect with themselves. Through traffic on local
residential streets should be discouraged. If four-legged intersections are
utilized, traffic calming measures may be recommended by the City or County
Engineer and approved by the MUAPB, and made a condition of plat approval.
The use of three-legged intersections (Ts) is encouraged, when appropriate.
(B) Any type of street layout pattern may be used that best fits the topography. A
curvilinear system, grid system, or modified grid system are acceptable
alternatives. Cul-de-sac use should be carefully considered in the planning of a
subdivision to ensure that all forms of vehicular and pedestrian traffic demands
and other safety issues such as fire access have been adequately addressed.
(C) In commercial or industrial developments, the streets and other access ways shall
be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities
and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, walks and
parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types
of traffic, including pedestrian.
10-203 STANDARDS FOR BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.
(A) Bicycle and pedestrian access are an integral component of the overall
transportation network. Planning for the effective provision for bicycle and
pedestrian access begins with the subdivision process so as to ensure that safe,
convenient, and adequate facilities are accommodated.
(1) Bicycle Lanes and Routes.
X-3
(a) At a minimum, the layout of streets and other public ways on plats
shall be adequate to accommodate bicycle lanes and routes, wherever
such lanes or routes are identified by the Bicycle Master Plan.
(b) Bicycle lanes or routes must reflect the overall planning of the area in
which the subdivision is located. Bicycle lanes and routes shall
connect with any anticipated, existing or planned bicycle lane or
route, linear trail and street network.
(2) Pedestrian Access.
(a) Sidewalks.
(1) At a minimum, the layout of streets and other public ways
on plats shall be adequate to accommodate sidewalks that
comply with this Article.
(b) Linear Trail.
(1) Linear Trail extensions, and other pedestrian connections
when appropriate, shall be provided in accordance with the
Manhattan Linear Park Master Plan Phase II
Implementation Guidelines.
(c) Pedestrian Easements.
(1) Pedestrian easements shall be provided according to
Section 10-301 (C) and Section 10-601(H).
10-204. STANDARDS FOR STREET NAMES.
(A) A street, which is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall have the
same name. Names of new streets shall not be so similar in sound and/or
spelling to existing streets names as to cause confusion or misunderstanding,
irrespective of a suffix.
(B) Street names shall be subject to the review of the Planning Department(s), Public
Works Department, Fire Department, Post Office, and Police Department. Street
suffixes shall be used to provide for a uniform classification of street functions in
the following manner:
(1) Boulevard and Parkway shall be reserved for major arterial streets.
(2) Avenue and Parkway shall be used in conjunction with arterial and
collector streets.
X-4
(3) Drive, Road, Terrace, Street, and Way shall be used in conjunction with
local streets.
(4) Lane, Circle, and Court shall be used in conjunction with cul-de-sacs.
(5) Place shall only be used in conjunction with Travel Easements.
(C) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prevent, limit or restrict the
applicable Governing Body from renaming any street, once the street has been
dedicated to the public, to any name said Governing Body deems appropriate.
10-205. STANDARDS FOR LAYOUT AND DEDICATION OF TEMPORARY DEAD-END
STREETS AND CUL-DE-SACS.
(A) Temporary dead-end streets. If the property adjacent to a proposed subdivision is
undeveloped, any street that comes to a temporary dead-end, and would be
extended into a future subdivision on the adjacent property, may be required to
have a temporary "T" turnaround. The provision of the "T" turnaround shall not
affect street rights-of-way and the "T" shall not extend out of the street or utility
easement.
(B) Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs may be allowed where continuous street connections
are not necessary or where other options are not practical due to topographical
constraints. Cul-de-sacs shall provide adequate access to all abutting properties.
When cul-de-sacs are used, pedestrian and bicycle access through the cul-de-sac
to adjacent area shall be adequately accommodated. The cul-de-sac right-of-way
leading to the end of the turnaround shall be the minimum set out in the Table 1,
Minimum Right-of-Way Widths (Feet). The minimum diameter of the cul-de-sac
turnaround shall be one-hundred (100) feet in diameter. The maximum length of
a cul-de-sac shall be six-hundred (600) feet from the centerline of the intersecting
street, along the centerline of the cul-de-sac to the center of the turnaround. In
those instances where the MUAPB approves a Variation pursuant to Section 2-
501, allowing a cul-de-sac greater than six hundred (600) feet in length, the
subdivider shall be required to provide a street consistent with the City of
Manhattans Design Standards and Specifications, or The Specifications For
Streets Construction And Design, Subdivision Regulations of Riley County,
where applicable.
10-206. STANDARDS FOR TRAVEL EASEMENTS
(A) Travel Easements are similar to public streets in that they provide the public with
X-5
legal access to abutting private property. Travel Easements differ from public
streets in that the improvement located within the easement is owned,
constructed, repaired and maintained by the owners of abutting, or nearby,
properties.
(B) Travel Easements identified on any plat shall be deemed to grant an easement to
the public for travel, to the same extent as would be permitted over a public
street.
(C) The following shall apply to Travel Easements:
(1) Travel easements shall only be allowed in Planned Unit Developments.
(2) Travels Easements shall not be permitted if the applicable Governing
Body desires to accept dedication of such area, as a public street.
(3) Travel Easements shall only be used to provide internal access to properties
within a subdivision and shall not be permitted to provide access between
subdivisions.
(4) Improvements within a Travel Easement shall be designed, constructed,
repaired and maintained pursuant to policies adopted by the applicable
Governing Body.
(5) Subdividers desiring to create a Travel Easement shall be required to file
restrictive covenants, or similar documents, which legally bind abutting
properties to construct, repair and maintain the improvements pursuant to
these Regulations. Such covenants shall be in a form approved by the
applicable Governing Body, shall be enforceable by that Governing Body
and shall not be permitted to be amended or removed without the consent of
that Governing Body. The applicable Governing Body may require that the
enforcement of such covenants include the ability of the Governing Body to
make such repairs, or conduct such maintenance, that the abutting
properties fail to provide, and to assess the costs of such to such abutting
properties.
10-207. STANDARDS FOR ACCESS MANAGEMENT
(A) Access Management. Access management includes the control of the spacing,
location of driveways, side streets and intersections. Effective access
management is essential to achieving safe and efficient traffic operations on the
major street system. The amount of access should decrease as the functional
classification of the street increases.
(B) Driveway and Street Spacing. Driveways to abutting property should be
X-6
confined to local streets. Direct access to arterial and collector streets should be
prohibited unless no reasonable alternative is available. There are two primary
aspects to driveway spacing. One is the relationship of an intersecting side
street or driveway relative to the intersection of arterial and collector streets.
The other aspect is the relationship between intersecting local streets or
driveways along an arterial or collector street. The following standards are
hereby required:
(1)Along an arterial street with speeds equal to or greater than 50 m.p.h., no
side street or driveway shall intersect the arterial street within 660 feet of an
intersecting arterial or collector street, nor within 660 feet of an intersecting
local street or highway.
(2) Along an arterial street with speeds less than 50 m.p.h., no side street or
driveway shall intersect the arterial street within 500 feet of an intersecting
arterial or collector street, nor within 500 feet of an intersecting local street
or driveway.
(3) Along a collector street, no side street or driveway shall intersect the
collector street within 300 feet of an intersecting arterial street, nor within
150 feet of an intersecting local street or driveway.
(4) Along a local street, no local street or driveway shall intersect the local
street within 75 feet of another intersecting local street, except that a
driveway for a low density residential development may be reduced to
approximately 40 feet.
10-208. STANDARDS FOR ACCESS TO ARTERIALS AND COLLECTORS.
(A) Access to Arterials and Collectors. Direct access to an arterial or collector, in
the form of a private driveway, shall only be allowed when no other means of
access is available. The City or County Engineer shall review the subdivision
and make a recommendation to the MUAPB.
(1) Where a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision borders on, or
contains an existing or proposed limited access arterial or a collector, the
MUAPB may require a street system layout, which affords separation of
through and local traffic. This may be accomplished through reverse
frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear service areas or
frontage roads.
(2) Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or
proposed arterial or collector street, the MUAPB may require that access to
the arterial or collector street be limited by any of the following means:
(a) When a subdivision abuts an arterial or collector, the subdivision of
X-7
lots shall be laid out so as to back onto the arterial or collector
street and front onto a parallel local street, or cul-de-sac. No
access shall be provided directly to any lot from the arterial or
collector street. Pedestrian and bicycle access to the arterial or
collector sidewalk system should be accommodated by appropriate
use of pedestrian easements; or,
(b) A series of cul-de-sacs, u-shaped streets or short loops shall be
provided generally at right angles to a parallel street, with their
terminal lots backing onto the arterial or collector street and
providing no access to the arterial or collector street from such
lots. Pedestrian and bicycle access to the arterial or collector
system should be accommodated by appropriate use of pedestrian
easements. Eyebrow cul-de-sacs shall be prohibited, unless
approved by the MUAPB; or,
(c) A frontage road may be provided, and shall be separated from the
arterial or collector street by a minimum ten (10) foot wide
planting or grass strip, and providing access to the arterial street at
suitable points.
10-209. SPECIFIC STREET STANDARDS.
(A) General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and
improvements to accommodate future traffic and afford satisfactory access to
emergency and service vehicles; to provide for the safe operation of the street
system; and to coordinate streets so as to develop a convenient system that
avoids undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following standards are
hereby required:
(1) Street classification shall be indicated on the Functional Street
Classification Map.
(2) Right-of-way Widths. Right- of- way widths shall not be less than the
following:
TABLE 1
MINIMUM RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS (FEET)
Street Type City Urban Service Area Urban Area
Expressway 120 120 120
Arterial 100 100 100
Collector 70 80 80
X-8
Local 50 60 60
Cul-de-sac 50 60 60
Cul-de-sac
Turnaround
100 dia. 100 dia. 100 dia.
Frontage 50 60 60
(3) Right-of-way widths in excess of the minimum standards stated herein shall
be required whenever, due to topography or other considerations, additional
width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes or sight distances as
deemed necessary by the MUAPB. Right-of-way widths may be reduced in
accordance with Companion Easements, Section 10-601 (I).
(4) Other right-of-way considerations. Rights-of-way at intersections shall be
designed for sight distance considerations. For safety reasons and for
potential improvements at intersections, no less than a thirty (30) foot Vision
Triangle shall be platted as part of the right-of-way with any subdivision. No
fixed aboveground facilities should be located in the sight triangle at the
intersection (i.e. utility poles, trees, etc.). Consideration regarding the width
of the right-of-way, and companion easements, should be taken into account
when planning the street layout.
(5) Intersection Angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A variation may be approved by the MUAPB based
upon the recommendation of the City/County Engineer. The angle of
intersection shall not be less than seventy-five (75) degrees.
(6) Multiple Intersections. Intersections involving the junction of more than two
(2) streets shall be avoided whenever possible.
(7) Multiple approach intersections. Intersections involving more than four (4)
approaches should be avoided. Properly designed intersections with an
acceptable method to control traffic may be considered.
(8) Horizontal Sight Distances. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for
adequate horizontal sight distances on all curves.
(9) Design Speed. Design speed shall be in conformance with applicable sections
of AASHTO, A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
Operating and design speeds at the lower ranges identified in AASHTO are
encouraged.
(10) Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one-hundred-fifty
(150) feet shall be prohibited. The MUAPB may require the same standard
for cul-de-sacs depending on length of roadway and residential density.
X-9
(11) Distance Between Reverse Curves. A tangent of at least one hundred (100)
feet along the street centerline shall be required between horizontal reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
(12) Curvature. When the street centerline deflects more than ten (10) degrees, a
curve shall be inserted with a radius of footage no less than:
TABLE 2
MINIMUM CURVE RADII
City Urban Service Area Urban Area
Arterial 500 500 500
Collector 300 300 300
Local 150 150 150
(a) The MUAPB may, upon the advice of the City and/or County
Engineer, require an increase in the radius of the applicable curve.
(13) Street Grades. The grades of streets should not exceed the following
percentages:
TABLE 3
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GRADE
Street Type Maximum Grade
Arterial 5%
Collector 8%
Local 10%
(a) Any grades in excess of the above shall be reviewed by the
applicable City or County Engineer, and a recommendation made
to the MUAPB. No street grade shall be less than five-tenths
percent (0.5%), unless reviewed and recommended by the City or
County Engineer.
(14) Traffic Calming. Traffic calming measures are tools to be used in
conjunction with the horizontal and vertical design to achieve lower speeds
in the local residential street system. These measures should be
incorporated in the design of the street system. Recommended measures
include, but are not limited to, entry treatments, chokers, roundabouts,
circles, textured pavements, colored pavement and other geometric features
which will tend to reduce speed on a local residential street.
10-210. STANDARDS FOR ALLEYS.
(A) Alleys may be approved by the MUAPB with a subdivision. In those instances
X-10
where alleys are proposed, the MUAPB shall take into account lot and street
layout, and land uses to be served. When alleys are approved with a
subdivision, the following general standards shall apply:
(1) Alleys shall be platted at a minimum twenty (20) feet in width.
(2) Alleys shall be straight with no alley intersections, except as
may be approved by the MUAPB.
(3) Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
PART 3. STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS.
10-301. Blocks.
(A) The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard
to:
(1) Provision for adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the
type of use contemplated;
(2) Needs for convenient access, safety, circulation;
(3) Consideration of topography; and,
(4) Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
(B) Residential block lengths shall not exceed one thousand six hundred (1,600)
feet.
(C) Pedestrian easements not less than sixteen (16) feet in width shall be dedicated
to the public through blocks where deemed beneficial by the MUAPB to
provide for pedestrian access. These walkways shall be constructed in a
manner approved by the City/County Engineer.
PART 4. STANDARDS FOR LOTS.
10-401. Lots.
(A) The minimum dimensional requirements for proposed lots shall conform with the
applicable Zoning Regulations of the City and/or County that are in effect on the
date of Final Plat submittal, or as specified by the County Health Department.
(B) Each lot shall provide a buildable area. Properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and/or industrial purposes shall be of adequate size to provide for the
off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use, zoning district
X-11
and development contemplated.
(1) Lots intended for multiple-family, commercial, or industrial structures
and/or uses shall provide a buildable area behind the required setbacks,
which has less than a twenty (20) percent slope. In cases where there is no
existing slope that is less than twenty (20) percent, the lot size should either
be increased in area to provide for a buildable area with an existing slope
less than twenty (20) percent, or a specific grading plan shall be submitted
with the Preliminary Plat, which shall be approved by the MUAPB.
Grading plans shall incorporate provisions, which minimize grading,
removal of vegetation, land instability, fire or drainage hazards, or other
public safety hazards such as steep vertical cuts. Building site, off-street
parking lots and driveways must be considered with the grading plan. The
MUAPB may require the submittal of building and off-street parking lot
and driveway plans as a condition of approval with the Preliminary Plat,
which shall be submitted with the Final Plat. The MUAPB may deny a plat
that does not adequately address the minimization of grading, the removal
of vegetation, or creates public safety hazards such as steep vertical cuts.
Final grading plans shall be submitted with the Final Plat for subdivisions
subject to the provisions of this subsection.
(C) Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning
district, the MUAPB may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow
further subdivision and/or the opening of future streets. Such potential lots shall
be in compliance with the Zoning Regulations of the City and/or County, and
these Regulations.
(D) Through (double frontage) lots shall be avoided except where essential to
provide separation of residential development from a street right-of-way (e.g.
Reverse Frontage Lots) or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation.
(E) Side lot lines should be at right angles to streets, or perpendicular to the
tangent, except in special cases approved by the MUAPB, (such as lot
orientation for solar access).
(F) Lots shall be laid out so individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
existing drainage pattern for the area.
(G) The use of flag lots shall be prohibited in all subdivisions except where the
MUAPB determines that topography or other physical conditions on the
property necessitate the need for flexibility in the layout of the subdivision.
The following requirements shall apply to flag lots:
(1) The pole portion of the lot shall be at least thirty (30) feet in width.
X-12
(2) The flag portion of the lot shall comply with the minimum lot
requirements for width, depth and area for the zoning district in
which the lot is located.
(3) The area of the pole portion of the flag lot shall not be counted
towards meeting the minimum lot area requirements of the zoning
district in which the flag lot is located.
(4) If more than one flag lot is proposed to the rear of another lot, then
the subdivision shall only be considered in conjunction with a
Planned Unit Development.
(5) Access to the flag lot shall comply with the requirements of the
responsible Fire Department.
PART 5. STANDARDS FOR SOLAR SUBDIVISIONS.
10-501 Solar Subdivisions. Subdivisions that are intended to be established to provide for solar
access, are encouraged to follow the general standards set out below, in order to protect
solar access, and to provide the greatest flexibility in the design and layout of the
subdivision: The applicable Planning Department will work with a subdivider to help
place restrictions on the plat in order to protect solar access for any subdivision proposal
that will be sensitive to the need for solar access.
(A) The subdivision should be a Planned Unit Development.
(B) Open space and landscaping should be located to protect buildings and/or solar
equipment from shading from other buildings in, or adjacent to, the
subdivision.
(C) Street orientation should provide proper orientation of buildings or equipment
using solar energy.
