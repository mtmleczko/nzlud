    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Merriam, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through October 23, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula B. Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Juliana Pinnick, City Clerk, and Michelle Daise, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 1-14. - Conflicting regulations. 
(a)  If the provisions of different chapters conflict with each other, the provisions of each individual chapter shall control all issues arising out of the events and persons intended to be governed by that chapter. 
(b)  If the provisions of different sections of the same chapter conflict with each other, the provision which is more specific in its application to the events or persons raising the conflict shall control over the more general provision. 
(c)  If any of the provisions hereof conflict, and the conflict cannot be resolved by application of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the more stringent regulation shall apply and the specific provision shall prevail over the general. 
Sec. 1-15. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the governing body that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the governing body without the incorporation in this Code of any such invalid or unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-195. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the citizens; that government decisions and policies be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, an article for all city officials and employees is hereby adopted. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or omissions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. This article is also intended to establish standards of conduct expected of those persons who act for or on behalf of the public in the performance of governmental duties and responsibilities, maintain high ethical standards in city government and increase public confidence in the integrity of the officials, agents and employees of the city. 
(Code 1967, §§ 2-104, 2-105)

    Every public official and employee is expected to maintain the following standards:

(13)  Examples. 
a.  Councilperson A learns through an executive session how much the city is willing to pay for a building.

This would violate subsection (7) of this section.

Councilperson B's family owns a siding business that intends to bid on the project if siding is required. Councilperson B should abstain from discussion or voting on the issue. 
c.  A paving contractor offers to repair a city employee's driveway as part of the street overlay program for no (or minimal) cost. To accept such work would be a violation of subsections (4), (10) and (11) of this section. 
d.  The city administrator receives a gift certificate for $500.00 from a city vendor; the gift certificate should be returned to avoid violation of subsection (10) of this section.

Such conduct would violate subsection 6) of this section.

If however, first-class air fare is provided, extraordinary entertainment offered or unusual gratuities are provided, the employee should notify the company that such items are inappropriate and should not be accepted. Otherwise, a violation of subsection (10) of this section takes place. 
g.  The city attorney and members of his firm should at no time represent a private client in proceedings before the city at any level.

Arrangements should be made by the city attorney to have the city and the client represented by qualified, independent attorneys if legal advice is required. 
(Code 1967, § 2-107) 
Sec. 2-198. - Interpretation and guidelines. 
(a)  This article is intended to establish standards to guide the decisions and actions of the public officials and employees in the performance of their official duties and functions. The standards established by the Code are rules of reason and not rules of law, and they do not themselves seek to impose duties or obligations not otherwise required of public officials and employees. Rather, the standards seek to recognize the expectations inherent in government service through public opinion and perception and to define the special responsibilities that arise through the representation and authority of government. Likewise, the Code does not attempt to exhaust the moral and ethical values that must guide government actions, nor does it displace professional knowledge, skill or judgment. No set of rules or standards can do so, and every person in government service must also be guided by personal conscience and the independent ideals of their profession, as well as the legal duties imposed upon him. These standards, therefore, should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of government service and the unique stature of public professionalism. 
(b)  Any public official who serves on a board where an agenda item appears in which the public official has a direct or potential financial interest shall make known that interest to the chairperson prior to discussion of that topic. The public officer shall remove himself from the discussion, leave the room and not return until the item is tabled or acted upon. The affected public officials shall not vote on such item. 
(Code 1967, § 2-108) 
Sec. 2-199. - Sanctions for violations. 
    For any violation of the article, the following enforcement actions may be taken: 
(1)  For employees of the city: 
a.  A written warning or reprimand may be issued by the city administrator pursuant to the personnel policies; 
b.  Suspension, demotion or termination of the employee by the city administrator pursuant to the personnel policies; 
c.  A complaint be filed at the direction of the city council for action with law enforcement officials; or 
d.  The matter may be dismissed by the city administrator for lack of cause. 
(2)  For elected officials of the city: 
a.  A public censure or reprimand may be issued by council; 
b.  A complaint be filed for action with law enforcement officials; 
c.  The matter be referred to the state attorney general for consideration; or 
d.  The matter may be dismissed for lack of cause. 
(3)  For appointed officials of the city, persons acting as representatives of the city or city administrator: 
a.  A public censure or reprimand may be issued; 
b.  Removal from the office or position, or termination of any contract, agreement or representative status; 
c.  A complaint be filed for action with law enforcement officials; or 
d.  The matter may be dismissed for lack of cause. 
(4)  Actions taken under subsection (1) of this section as it relates to the city administrator shall be at the discretion of the city council after review in executive session, and upon motion duly made, seconded and passed by a majority of the council. All other actions taken under subsections (2) and (3) of this section as such relate to elected or appointed officials shall be at the direction of the city council after review in compliance with the Kansas Open Meetings Act. In the event a motion to take action on a matter fails, or a motion is passed to take no action, the matter will be dismissed for lack of cause.

Secs. 26-1-26-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD PREVENTION AND DAMAGE CONTROL 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 26-19. - Statutory authorization. 
(a)  Approval of draft ordinance by state chief engineer prior to adoption. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture May 14, 2009. 
(b)  Kansas statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766 , delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council ordains as follows. 
(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. 1, § 7-16) 
Sec. 26-20. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of the ordinance from which this article is derived, uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated August 3, 2009, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. 1, § 7-17; Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 3-26-2001) 
Sec. 26-21. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 26-20(b); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this article to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

    Special hazard area means an area having special flood hazards and shown on an FHBM, FIRM or FBFM as zones (unnumbered or numbered) A, AO, AE, or AH. 
    Start of construction includes substantial-improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvements were within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, the erection of temporary forms, nor installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial-improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    State coordinating agency means the Division of Water Resources, Kansas Department of Agriculture, or other office designated by the governor of the state or by state statute at the request of the Administrator to assist in the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in that state.

    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. "Structure" for insurance purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. 
    Substantial-damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial-improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial-damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Surface waters means any body of water classified as "surface waters" by the state, including streams, rivers, creeks, brooks, sloughs, draws, arroyos, canals, springs, seeps, cavern streams, alluvial aquifers associated with these surface waters, lakes, manmade reservoirs, oxbow lakes, ponds, and wetlands, as well as any other body of water classified by the federal government as a "water of the United States." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the community. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Waste means any garbage, refuse, sludge or other discarded material which is abandoned or committed to treatment, storage or disposal, including solid, liquid, semisolid or contained gaseous materials resulting from industrial, commercial mining, community and agricultural activities. Waste does not include solid or dissolved materials in domestic sewage or irrigation return flows or solid or dissolved materials or industrial discharges which are point sources subject to permits under the state. The federal definition of solid waste is found at 40 CFR 257.2. 
    Water quality standard means the law or regulation that consists of the beneficial designated use of a water body, the numeric and narrative water quality criteria that are necessary to protect the use of that particular water body, and an antidegradation statement. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain.

Sec. 26-114. - Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in section 26-23 are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  AO zones. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

Sec. 26-150. - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (b) through (f) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination; provided, the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  The city floodplain administrator shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this division.

In general the methods and procedures described in the Urban Drainage Design Manual, "Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22" and section 5600 of the APWA Standard Specifications and Design Criteria as modified or amended in this article, shall be used for storm drainage design in the city. However, any computational method or computer program based on fundamental hydrologic and hydraulic principles and currently accepted engineering practice may be used in design. Methods and procedures, which deviate from those of HEC 22 or those described in this article shall be reviewed and approved by the city prior to their use. 
(5)  Disclaimer of liability. 
a.  Performance standards and design criteria. The hydrological and hydraulics criteria set forth in this article are minimum design standards based on the current state of the art as propounded by local, regional and national engineering authorities and agencies. Their intention is not to eliminate the possibility of storm-related damage occurring, but rather to manage the risk associated with the probability of such damage occurring. Their implementation must be accomplished under the direction of a registered professional engineer using sound engineering judgment and practices, who will assume full professional responsibility for his work. The city, its officers, and employees offer no guarantee or warranty with respect to the design criteria and assume no liability for their implementation by others. 
b.  Drainage permit. City review and approval of the drainage study and stormwater management plan are for conformance with these criteria only and are not intended as an endorsement or a quality assurance/control check of the design. The city, its officers and employees assume no liability with respect to the approval of the drainage study and stormwater management plan or any lawfully made related legislative or administrative decision.

(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. I, § 7-1; Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 3-26-2001; Ord. No. 1689, § 1(7-1), 7-9-2012; Ord. No. 1729, § 3, 1-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 26-171. - Performance criteria. 
(a)  Secondary or major system protective levels. Regardless of land use, the secondary or major system shall be designed to limit water surface elevations from runoff produced by the 100-year storm in the vicinity of buildings or structures to the lowest elevation at which water may enter the structure less one foot of freeboard (i.e., low entry elevation minus one foot). Regardless of street classification, the maximum 100-year flood ponding elevation at the low point in streets (measured at the crown) shall be seven inches or 0.58 feet. Primary system collection and conveyance elements shall be proportioned as required to maintain the foregoing secondary system protective levels. 
(b)  Primary or minor system design. Primary or minor system collection and conveyance elements including inlets and conduits shall be proportioned to limit the design storm in-system hydraulic grade line (HGL) to an elevation no less than six inches or 0.5 feet below any opening to the surface. A minimum of one foot of freeboard shall be maintained between the top of bank of open channels and the design stormwater surface elevation; and between the right-of-way line low point and the design storm headwater pool at culverts. Primary system collection and conveyance elements (including open channels) shall be sized for design storms according to land use or function as indicated below: 
(1)  Residential districts: 10-year storm. 
(2)  Commercial districts: 25-year storm. 
(3)  Industrial districts: 25-year storm. 
(4)  Government and institutional districts: 25-year storm. 
(5)  Bridges, culverts or pipes crossing arterial streets: 50-year storm. 
(6)  100-year floodway: 100-year storm. 
(c)  Stormwater detention and retention. 
(1)  Unless adverse downstream conditions dictate a lower rate, detention facilities shall be designed to limit the total site discharge from the 100-year storm to no more than 1.8 cfs per acre with a minimum of 0.5 feet of freeboard to the crest of the emergency spillway. The full 100-year storm discharge from offsite tributary areas may be added to the allowable on-site release rate if downstream conditions permit. In addition to the water storage volume needed to meet detention requirements, facilities shall be designed to provide for sedimentation storage as determined by the following formula: 
S = 15YIA 
where: 
S = sediment storage in cubic feet. 
Y = number of years before sediment is removed. 
I = ratio of impervious surface to total tributary area based on land use. 
A = total area tributary to the detention facility. 
(2)  The number of years of sediment storage to be provided will be based on a maintenance plan and agreement giving the city the right to enter the property and remove sediment at the owner's expense in the event of failure to maintain. The agreement will run with the land and will be a condition of stormwater management plan and final plat approval. 
(d)  Existing drainage system components. Existing drainage system collection, conveyance and storage elements may be retained as elements of an improved system providing: 
(1)  They are in sound structural condition. 
(2)  Their hydraulic capacity, including surcharge, is not less than 80 percent of the capacity required for the land use and function stipulated in subsection (c) of this section. 
(3)  Adequate easements exist or will be provided for their operation and maintenance. 
(e)  Existing upstream drainage systems. In determining discharges from off-site sources, it shall be assumed that upstream collection and conveyance elements function in accordance with these design criteria, regardless of their actual condition and performance. However, should the designer elect to use lower flows from an upstream detention system, that system's operating characteristics for each design storm considered; physical condition; maintenance history; and long term viability must be evaluated and reported in the drainage study. 
(f)  Existing downstream drainage systems. The impact of the development and proposed drainage system on downstream improvements will be evaluated and made part of the drainage study. The city may, at its discretion, require lower on-site detention facility release rates or participation in improvements to the downstream system including a regional detention facility to relieve existing flooding conditions. 
(g)  Detention waivers. Detention may be waived, at the discretion of the community development director, in the event that the developer demonstrates in the drainage study that the delayed release rate will increase a downstream peak discharge from the larger overall drainage basin concentrating at a later time than the included subject sub-basin. However, the developer will be required to either propose or participate in alternate mitigating measures if the increase in runoff from the development will cause or aggravate downstream flooding or overtax existing inadequate or obsolete drainage facilities. 
(h)  Curb inlets and street gutter capacity. Curb inlets shall be located to control street spread ("T" width of water surface normal to the gutter as measured from a point in the gutter 0.5 feet from the back of the curb) for discharges calculated at the curb inlet's sub-basin time of concentration according to the following: 
Street Width 
(back of curb to back of curb-ft.) Spread 
(0.5 ft.from back of curb-ft.) Depth of Flow 
(ft.) 28 or less 10.0 0.20 28+ to 36 11.0 0.22 36+ 11.5 0.23 Divided roadways as above for each direction Arterial and collector intersections 5.5 0.12 Pedestrians crosswalks 5.5 0.12  
(i)  Spread. Spread shall be determined at the beginning of the gutter flare to the curb inlet using Izzard's equation or appropriate nomographs. Spread at the ends of flares to sump inlets located in the low point of sag vertical curves shall be calculated using a minimum street grade (S) of 0.3 percent. Curb inlet capacity shall be determined using the methods and formulas or appended nomographs found in any of the following: or appended nomographs Chapter 4 of HEC 22; Hydraulic Performance of Setback Curb Inlets (Report No. K-TRAN: KU-98-3, Bruce M. McEnroe, and Reuben P. Wade, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, June 1998); and Hydraulic Performance of Curb and Gutter Inlets (Report No. K-TRAN: KU-99-1, Bruce M. McEnroe, Reuben P. Wade, and Andrew K. Smith, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas). Curb inlets shall be rated at 80 percent of their calculated capacity as a clogging allowance. 
(j)  Field or area inlets. Field or area inlets shall be designed as a broad crested weir (Q=CLH 3/2 , where C=2.8) to a depth equal to the top of the opening and as an orifice (Q=Ca(2gh) 1/2 , where C=0.6) when the opening is submerged. Field or area inlets shall be rated at 50 percent of their calculated capacity as a clogging allowance. Although steel frames or bars spaced at no less than four-inch intervals may be placed in the inlet throats for safety purposes, grates will not be permitted. 
(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. I, § 7-2; Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 3-26-2001; Ord. No. 1689, § 2(7-2), 7-9-2012; Ord. No. 1729, § 3, 1-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 26-172. - System location. 
    Storm drainage system components may be comprised of any combination of collection, conveyance and storage elements, which will meet the stipulated design criteria for primary/minor and secondary/major drainage systems. 
(1)  Open channels (public and private). Drainage may be conveyed by natural or improved open channels in unimproved street rights-of-way; where an enclosed system is not specifically required; or where the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year storm meets appropriate protective levels in the vicinity of buildings. 
(2)  Enclosed systems (public and private). Generally, enclosed systems shall be used in improved street rights-of-way (extending at least to the right-of-way limits); commercial, industrial, governmental, and institutional development site drainage; along side property lines to a point at least 60 feet to the rear of the front building line in residential developments; in cases where open channel banks are unstable and present or future erosion may damage property; and where an open channel may be hazardous to the public. However, the community development director may waive the requirement for an enclosed system in cases where flooding, erosion, safety and water quality concerns are otherwise adequately addressed. 
(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. I, § 7-3; Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 3-26-2001; Ord. No. 1689, § 3(7-3), 7-9-2012; Ord. No. 1729, § 3, 1-12-2015 )

(b)  Maintenance responsibilities. 
(1)  Public stormwater projects. Easements located on city property shall be maintained by the city, and easements located on private property shall be maintained in the same manner as for private stormwater projects. 
(2)  Private stormwater projects. 
a.  Single ownership. The owner or developer, and his grantees and successors in title, shall be responsible for the perpetual maintenance of all easements dedicated to the city for a stormwater project, and any and all conveyances shall contain a covenant to such effect. 
b.  Multiple ownerships. The owner or developer of a stormwater project developed on a tract of land which is or will be subdivided into more than one ownership shall give a covenant to be filed with the subdivision plat providing perpetual maintenance of all easements dedicated to the city by the owners of record. 
(c)  Continuous between streets; minimum size. Easements shall run continuously between streets and shall be sized as follows: 
(1)  Pipe and culverts: 15-foot minimum of outside width of the conduit plus ten feet, whichever is greater. 
(2)  Improved open channels: 15-foot minimum on top of banks on both sides. 
(3)  Detention facilities: The area bounded by a 20-foot-wide strip around the perimeter of the facility as measured from the top of bank, plus an access easement of 20 feet in width between the site and a public street. 
(4)  Natural open channels: 30 feet of an area enclosed by the design hydraulic grade line contour plus ten feet measured on each side, whichever is greater; however, the easement shall be increased as required to permit access by truck along its entire length. 
(Code 1967, ch. 7, art. I, § 7-4; Ord. No. 1400, § 1, 3-26-2001) 
Sec. 26-174. - Hydrology. 
    The following methods of runoff computation shall be used depending upon the size of the watershed and the type and use of the facility: 
(1)  The Rational Method formula may be used to determine peak discharges for the design of enclosed and open channel collection and conveyance elements tributary to watersheds of 200 acres or less. 
a.  Rational Method. 
Q = KCIA 
Where: 
Q = discharge in cubic feet per second 
K = dimensionless antecedent precipitation coefficient 
C = dimensionless runoff coefficient 
I = intensity in inches per hour 
A = tributary area in acres 
b.  The value of K shall vary with the frequency of the storm event according to the following schedule: 
Storm Frequency 
(years) K 1 1.0 25 1.1 5 1.2 10 1.25  
Note: the product of K and C in the rational formula shall not exceed 1.

d.  In watersheds with multiple land use areas, the designer shall select the C value corresponding to the highest use representing an area greater than ten percent of the watershed or he may develop a composite "C" based on the surface type or land use mix. Undeveloped property will be assigned C values in accordance with the city's adopted land use plan or, if not included in the plan, shall be assigned a value of 0.50. 
e.  Time. 
1.  The time of concentration corresponding to the storm duration shall equal the sum of the inlet time (sheet flow) and travel time (concentrated flow) through the watershed. Time of concentration shall be calculated using the methods given in APWA "Standard Specifications and Design Criteria" section 5600 or in Chapter 3 of the "Urban Drainage Design Manual" (HEC-22). However, the designer should use one approach or the other and should not mix the different elements of the two together. 
2.  Inlet time shall not be less than five minutes nor greater than 15 minutes and shall be determined using either the inlet time formula given in section 5602.5, the nomograph in Fig. 2 of section 5608 of the APWA criteria or the "Sheet Flow Travel Time Formula" (3-3) given in Chapter 3 of HEC-22. Inlet times shall not be calculated using a flow distance of greater than 200 feet nor a land slope of less than two percent. 
3.  Travel time shall be calculated directly using Manning's Formula for the size and type of conveyance involved or using the nomograph in Fig. 3 of the APWA section 5608. Travel time may also be determined from travel time velocities corresponding to average land slope percentages as indicated in section 5602.5 of the APWA criteria or using the "Shallow Concentrated Flow Velocity" (3-4) and "Open Channel and Pipe Flow Velocity" (3-5) equations in Chapter 3 of HEC-22. 
e.  Intensity shall be determined from the rainfall intensity formulas given in Table C or the Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves shown in Fig. 1 of section 5608 of the APWA criteria, or from the Johnson County "Rainfall Intensity Table" contained in "Rainfall Intensity Tables For Counties In Kansas" as developed for the Kansas Department of Transportation by Bruce M. McEnroe and John P. Jones of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Kansas.

Other methods may be proposed, but must be approved by the community development director prior to their use. 
(3)  Inflow hydrographs for the design of detention and retention basins shall be developed using the SCS (NCRS) Tabular Hydrograph Method as described in "Urban Hydrology For Small Watersheds," Technical Release No. 55 (latest edition). Calculations shall be based on CN values derived for average antecedent runoff conditions (AMC II), hydrologic soil group "C," and land use according to the following schedule:

Q = total gutter and street section flow, cfs 
W = the width of the depressed gutter section from the gutter lip to the front face of the inlet opening, ft. 
T = the total width of flow in the gutter and street section, ft. 
(allowable design storm spread plus curb inlet setback for maximum allowable capacity calculations) 
Curb inlets on grade may also be evaluated using the methods described in Reports No. K-TRAN: KU-98-3 and KU-99-1. 
3.  Curb inlets in sumps or sag locations and side opening field or area inlets shall be evaluated as weirs or orifices in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of HEC No. 22 (as modified in this Code for use with city standard curb, gutter and inlet configurations) using the following: 
(i)  In cases of curb inlets with depressed gutters where d, ft.[ depth of flow as measured for a normal street cross section, ft, i.e., d = T S x (T and S x as defined above)] is less than or equal to h, ft.(height of inlet opening), a modified weir equation shall be used:

(ii)  In cases of curb inlets without depressed gutters and field or area inlets where d (as defined above for curb inlets, or depth of flow at the throat invert for field or area inlets or opening invert at the inlet face if there is no throat) is less than or equal to h (as defined above) this modified weir equation shall be used: 
Q = C C red L d 1.5 
where: 
Q = discharge, cfs 
C = coefficient of discharge, 3 
C red = capacity reduction factor for clogging, 0.8 for curb inlets, 
0.5 for field or area inlets 
L = length of curb opening, ft.

(iii)  In cases of curb inlets with or without depressed gutters and area or field inlets where d (as defined above) is greater than h (as defined above), then a modified orifice equation shall be used: 
Q = C C red A [2 g (d - h/2)] 0.5 
where: 
Q = discharge, cfs 
C = coefficient of discharge, 0.67 
C red = capacity reduction factor for clogging, 0.8 for curb inlets, 
0.5 for field or area inlets 
A = area of opening, ft 2 
g = acceleration due to gravity, 32.2, ft./sec. 2 
d = as defined above 
h = as defined above 
(iv)  Curb inlets in sumps may also be evaluated using the methods described in Reports No. K-TRAN: KU-98-3 and KU-99-1. 
c.  Conveyance elements. 
1.  Curb and gutter flow shall be evaluated using variants of Izzard's equation as in the following from Chapter 4 of HEC No. 22: 
Q = S x 1.67 S L 0.5 T 2.67 K c /n 
where: 
Q = discharge, cfs 
S x = street cross slope, ft./ft. 
S L = street longitudinal slope, ft./ft. 
T = width of flow (spread), ft. 
K c = a dimensionless constant of proportionality, 0.56 
n = Manning's coefficient, 0.016 
Note: Flow depth may be determined using the equation d = T S x as previously indicated for curb inlets. 
2.  Natural and improved open channels shall be evaluated using variants of Manning's equation: 
Q = 1.49 A R 2/3 S o 1/2 /n 
where: 
Q = discharge, cfs 
1.49 = a dimensionless constant of proportionality 
A = flow area ft. 2 
R = hydraulic radius (flow area divided by the wetted perimeter), ft. 
S o = channel slope, ft./ft. 
n = Manning's coefficient for open channels as shown in Table A in section 5608 of the APWA design criteria or the maximum values shown in Table 3-4 in Chapter 3 of HEC No. 22. 
3.  Conveyance through enclosed conduits shall be evaluated for open channel, full flow and pressure flow conditions using Manning's equation as defined above and in accordance with Chapter 7, of HEC No. 22. Manning's coefficient for closed conduits shall be taken from the aforementioned Tables A and 3-4 with the following exceptions: helical corrugated pipe n values may be those published in the "Handbook of Steel Drainage & Highway Construction Products," American Iron and Steel Institute, 1994; and published values based on experimental results from research sponsored by manufacturers may be used for other pipe materials. However, no value less than 0.013 may be used for any conduit. 
4.  Flow through nodal structures including curb inlets, field or area inlets, junction boxes, etc. shall be evaluated pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 7 of HEC No. 22. Energy losses and hydraulic grade line (HGL) elevations in such structures shall be determined according to the flow regime, type of structure, and vertical and horizontal configuration of the conduits. 
(i)  Super-critical flow. When flow in the downstream pipe is super-critical, no special assessment of energy losses at the node is required. The HGL in the structure will be assumed to be the normal depth in the downstream pipe and energy loss calculations may proceed upstream assuming a free outfall or low tail-water condition in the structure. 
(ii)  Sub-critical and pressurized flow. When flow in the downstream pipe is sub-critical or under pressure and the inverts of the upstream pipes are below the HGL in the structure, then the energy loss through the node shall be determined as a proportion of the velocity head: 
H = K (V o 2 /2 g) 
where: 
H = energy loss, ft. 
K = adjusted loss coefficient which varies as indicated below 
V o = velocity in downstream conduit 
g = acceleration due to gravity, 32.2 fps 
(iii)  The value of K for specific nodal cases may be determined using the formula shown below in connection with procedures described in Chapter 7 of HEC No. 22 or the generally more conservative values contained in the table which follows: 
K = K o C D C d C Q C P C B 
where: 
K o = initial loss coefficient based on relative structure size. 
C D = correction factor for pipe diameter (pressure flow only). 
C d = correction factor for flow depth 
C Q = correction factor for relative flow 
C P = correction factor for plunging flow 
C B = correction factor for benching 
Note: Where the determination of the above factors requires the use of circular pipe or manhole relative diameters, the hydraulic radius may be substituted when rectangular, arch or elliptical junction boxes and conduits are being evaluated. The hydraulic radius should also be used for circular pipes and structures if they are to be used in conjunction with other shapes.

(iv)  Culverts and enclosed system structures with upstream pipe inverts above the nodal HGL. These structures shall be investigated for the governing inlet or outlet control condition using the procedures described in "Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts," HDS-5 as indicated in the collection element design section of this Code. When using outlet control entrance loss K values as published in table B of section 5608 of the APWA criteria or table 7-5b of chapter 7, HEC No. 22, the designer should note that the values are for entrance losses only and do not account for the energy of motion in the pipe. When hand calculations are being performed, the designer should include the downstream pipe kinetic energy as well as the entrance loss in determining the nodal HGL. 
d.  Erosion control. 
1.  Conveyance system velocities shall fall within the following ranges for the channel linings listed: 
Lining Allowable Design 
Flow Velocity Seed and mulch 2 to 3 fps Sod and stake 2 to 5 fps Erosion control blanket 2 to 7 fps Riprap (15" thickness) 3 to 10 fps Grouted riprap, gabion revetment 3 to 15 fps Concrete pavement or competent in situ bedrock 3 to 20 fps Enclosed conduits 3 to 20 fps  
2.  Energy dissipation shall be provided at conveyance system outlets to reduce velocities as required to meet receiving channel limits.

DIVISION 2. - STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION 

Sec. 26-199. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  The purpose of this division shall be to prevent the discharge of pollutants from land and activities within the city into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or into surface waters. 
(b)  The city council of the city hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface waters, both through inappropriate nonstormwater discharges into the MS4 or the surface waters directly, and through the wash off and transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by stormwater during rainfall events. 
(c)  Further, the city council hereby finds that such discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals, particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation, recreation, and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals. 
(d)  Further, the city council of the city hereby finds that the ordinance from which this division is derived, will promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system. 
(e)  Further, the city council of hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental preservation. 
(f)  Further, the city council hereby finds that a reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on activities within the city is necessary to eliminate or minimize such discharges of pollutants, to protect the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value of existing water resources within the city and within downstream communities, and to comply with the provisions of the city's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the NPDES program.

(b)  By way of illustration and not limitation, the following shall be considered within the definition of nuisance: 
(1)  Improper exterior maintenance of commercial, industrial and residential buildings, including peeling paint, broken windows, broken doors, deteriorated roofing or siding.

(a)  The purpose of this article is to provide reasonable controls restricting the excessive growth of weeds, grasses, and other uncultivated vegetation; to declare that the excessive growth of such vegetation is noxious, unsightly, offensive to the residential and commercial areas in the city, and is offensive to the general public health, safety and welfare of the community; to provide a method of enforcement of this article; to provide procedures to notify property owners or those in control of the property that a violation exists and to allow for self-abatement by such owner; to provide property owners or those in control of the property notification and an opportunity to be heard concerning violations of this article; to provide administrative procedures to allow the city to direct the abatement of violations; to provide a method of assessing or collecting costs for such abatement; to declare that the existence of such violations are unlawful and to provide penalties for enforcement through the municipal court system.

(4)  They create a public safety hazard when placed in streets, roadways, highways or upon public property; and 
(5)  They constitute a fire hazard in that they block access for the fire department to adjacent buildings and structures.

Such map or maps shall be marked "Official copy of zoning district map incorporated into zoning regulations by adoption of an ordinance by the city council of the city on the ____________ day of ____________ , 20 ____________ " and filed in the office of the city clerk or such other public office as may be designated by the city council.

b.  Override the planning commission's recommendations by two-thirds majority vote of the membership of the city council; or 
c.  Return the same to the planning commission for further consideration together with a statement specifying the basis for the city council's failure to approve or disapprove. 
(4)  If the city council returns the planning commission's recommendations, the planning commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendations giving the reasons therefor or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the city council by simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance, or the city council need take no further action thereon. 
(5)  If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the city council following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the city council's report, the city council shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. 
(6)  The proposed zoning regulations and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. 
(e)  The city council, from time to time, may supplement, change or generally revise the boundaries or regulations contained in zoning regulations by amendment. A proposal for such amendment may be initiated by the city council or the planning commission. If such proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the amendment may be initiated by application of the owner of property affected. Any such amendment, if in accordance with the land use plan or the land use element of a comprehensive plan, is presumed to be reasonable. The city council shall consider the following matters when approving or disapproving a rezoning request: 
(1)  The character of the neighborhood; 
(2)  Whether the proposed use will result in increasing the amount of vehicular traffic to the point where the capacity of the street network is exceeded; 
(3)  Whether the proposed use is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the public and will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use, visual quality or marketability of adjoining property; 
(4)  Whether the noise, vibration, dust or illumination that would normally be associated with such use is of such duration and intensity as to create problems for nearby property; 
(5)  Whether the proposed use would pollute the air, land or water; 
(6)  The relative gain to the public health, safety and welfare as compared to the hardship imposed upon landowners; 
(7)  Whether the proposed use would result in overcrowding of land or overcrowding population; 
(8)  The zoning uses of properties nearby; 
(9)  The suitability of the subject property for the uses which it has been restricted; 
(10)  The length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned; 
(11)  Recommendations of professional staff; and 
(12)  Conformance of the requested change to the adopted or recognized comprehensive plan adopted by the city. 
(f)  The city council may establish reasonable fees to be paid in advance by the owner of any property at the time of making application for a zoning amendment. 
(g)  All such proposed amendments first shall be submitted to the planning commission for recommendation. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, shall cause an accurate written summary to be made of the proceedings, and shall give notice in like manner as that required for recommendations on the original proposed zoning regulations. Such notice shall fix the time and place for such hearing and contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or restrictions or in the boundary or classification of any zone or district. If such proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the property shall be designated by legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. In addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed amendment shall be mailed at least 20 days before the hearing to all owners of record of land located within at least 200 feet of the area proposed to be altered. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the planning commission or the city council. Such notice is sufficient to permit the planning commission to recommend amendments to zoning regulations which affect only a portion of the land described in the notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. A recommendation of a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid without republication and, where necessary, remailing, unless the planning commission has previously established a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classification. At any public hearing held to consider a proposed rezoning, an opportunity shall be granted to interested parties to be heard. 
(h)  Unless otherwise provided herein, the procedure for the consideration and adoption of any such proposed amendment shall be in the same manner as that required for the consideration and adoption of the original zoning regulations. 
(1)  A majority of the members of the planning commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or denial of the amendment to the city council. If the planning commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the planning commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval. 
(2)  When the planning commission submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of such amendment and the reasons therefor, the city council may: 
a.  Adopt such recommendation by ordinance; 
b.  Override the planning commission's recommendation by a two-thirds majority vote of the membership of the city council; or 
c.  Return such recommendation to the planning commission with a statement specifying the basis for the city council's failure to approve or disapprove. 
(3)  If the city council returns the planning commission's recommendation, the planning commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefor or submit new and amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation the city council, by a simple majority thereof may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the city council following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the city council's report, the city council shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly. The proposed rezoning shall become effective upon publication of the adopting ordinance. 
(i)  If such amendment affects the boundaries of any zone or district, the ordinance shall describe the boundaries as amended or if provision is made for the fixing of the same upon an official map which has been incorporated by reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the official map to be changed to reflect such amendment, shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and shall reincorporate such map as amended. 
(j)  Regardless of whether or not the planning commission approves or disapproves a zoning amendment, if a protest petition against such amendment is filed in the office of the city clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of record of 20 percent or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of 20 percent or more of the total area required to be notified of the proposed rezoning of a specific property, excluding streets and public ways, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a three-fourths vote of all of the members of the city council. 
(k)  Zoning regulations may provide additional notice by providing for the posting of signs on land which is the subject of a proposed rezoning, for the purpose of providing notice of such proposed rezoning. 
(l)  Regulations adopted shall not apply to the existing use of any building or land, but shall apply to any alteration of building to provide for a change in use or a change in the use of any building or land after the effective date of any regulations adopted. If a building is damaged by more than 50 percent of its fair market value such building shall not be restored if the use of such building is not in conformance with the regulations adopted. 
(m)  Except for floodplain regulations in areas designated as a floodplain, regulations adopted by the city pursuant to K.S.A. 12-715b , and amendments thereto, shall not apply to the use of land for agricultural purposes, nor for the erection or maintenance of buildings thereon for such purposes so long as such land and buildings are used for agricultural purposes and not otherwise.

(3)  The city council either may: 
a.  Approve such recommendations by ordinance; 
b.  Override the planning commission's recommendations by a two-thirds majority vote; or 
c.  May return the same to the planning commission for further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the city council's failure to approve or disapprove. 
(4)  If the city council returns the planning commission's recommendations, the planning commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendations giving the reasons therefor or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the city council, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. 
(5)  If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the city council following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the city council's report, the city council shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The proposed subdivision regulations and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. 
(d)  Compliance with subdivision regulations may be required as the condition of an issuance of a building or zoning permit when so specified in the subdivision regulations. 
(e)  The owner or owners of any land located within an area governed by regulations subdividing the same into lots and blocks or tracts or parcels, for the purpose of laying out any subdivisions, suburban lots, building lots, tracts or parcels or any owner of any land establishing any street, alley, park or other property intended for public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots, tracts or parcels of land fronting thereon or adjacent thereto, shall have a plat drawn as may be required by the subdivision regulations. Such plat shall accurately describe the subdivision, lots, tracts or parcels of land giving the location and dimensions thereof and the location and dimensions of all streets, alleys, parks or other properties intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots, tracts or parcels of land fronting thereon or adjacent thereto. All plats shall be verified by the owner or owners thereof. All such plats shall be submitted to the planning commission. 
(f)  The planning commission shall determine if the plat conforms to the provisions of the subdivision regulations. If such determination is not made within 60 days after the first meeting of such commission following the date of the submission of the plat to the secretary thereof, such plat shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate shall be issued by the secretary of the planning commission upon demand. If the planning commission finds that the plat does not conform to the requirements of the subdivision regulations, the planning commission shall notify the owner or owners of such fact. If the plat conforms to the requirements of such regulations, there shall be endorsed thereon the fact that the plat has been submitted to and approved by the planning commission. 
(g)  The city council shall accept or refuse the dedication of land for public purposes within 30 days after the first meeting of the city council following the date of the submission of the plat to the clerk thereof. The city council may defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the requirements established by the city council. No additional filing fees shall be assessed during that period. If the city council defers or refuses such dedication, it shall advise the planning commission of the reasons therefor. 
(h)  The city council may establish a scale of reasonable fees to be paid to the secretary of the planning commission by the applicant for approval for each plat filed with the planning commission.

Such regulations shall contain a procedure for issuance of building or zoning permits on divided lots which shall take into account the need for adequate street rights-of-way, easements, improvement of public facilities, and zoning regulations. 
(k)  The regulations shall provide for a procedure which specifies a time limit within which action shall be taken, and shall further provide, where applicable, for the final decision on the issuance of such building permit to be made by the city council, except as may be provided by law.

(m)  For the purpose of single-family residential developments, development rights in such land use shall vest upon recording of a plat of such land. If construction is not commenced on such land within five years of recording a plat, the development rights in such shall expire. 
(n)  For all purposes other than single-family developments, the right to use land for a particular purpose shall vest upon the issuance of all permits required for such use and construction has begun and substantial amounts of work have been satisfactorily completed under a valid building permit.

Sec. 50-77. - Administration. 
(a)  The board of zoning appeals shall administer the details of appeals from or other matters referred to it regarding the application of chapter 74, zoning. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal or any other matter referred to it. Notice of the time, place and subject of such hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper 20 days prior to the date fixed for hearing.

The applicant shall place a sign provided by the city upon the property in question specifying the type of action proposed for such property at least ten days prior to the board of zoning appeals meeting. The sign shall be of a sufficient size and location to be readily viewed from public right-of-way. 
(b)  Appeals to the board of zoning appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any officer of the city, county or any governmental agency or body affected by any decision of the officer administering the provisions of the zoning ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the board, by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and the payment of the fee required therefor. The officer from whom the appeal is taken, when notified by the board or its agent, shall transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The board shall have power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.

(c)  When deemed necessary by the board of zoning appeals, the board may grant variances and exceptions from the zoning regulations on the basis and in the manner hereinafter provided: 
(1)  To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms of the regulations which will not be contrary to the public interest and where due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provision of the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the board that all of the following conditions have been met: 
a.  That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district, and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant; 
b.  That the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents; 
c.  That the strict application of the provisions of the zoning regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application; 
d.  That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare; and 
e.  That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the zoning regulation. 
(2)  To grant exceptions to the provision of the zoning regulation in those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when conditions of this exception as established in the zoning regulations by the city council, are not found to be present. 
(d)  Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any order or determination of the board may bring an action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the final decision of the board.

Chapter 53 - SIGNS AND OTHER ADVERTISING 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

(b)  Any sign or attention-attracting device already established on the effective date hereof, and which sign or attention-attracting device is rendered nonconforming by the provisions herein, and any sign or attention-attracting device which, as a result of subsequent amendments hereto, shall be rendered nonconforming, shall be subject to the regulations of section 53-6 (nonconformities). 
(Code 1967, § 5-8; Ord. No. 1366, § 1, 9-27-1999) 
Sec. 53-2. - Purpose. 
    The purposes set forth in this section, including those relating to the preservation, protection and promotion of public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city remain in effect and provide the basis for the following amendments to the this Code. 
(1)  Regulation and control of all advertising and identification signs or attention-attracting devices placed for exterior observation in order to preserve, protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city. 
(2)  Prevent an adverse community appearance from the unrestricted use of signs or attention-attracting devices by providing a flexible, creative, fair, comprehensive and enforceable set of regulations that will foster a high quality, aesthetic, visual environment for the city, enhancing it as a place to live and do business. 
(3)  Recognition of the business community's need for adequate business identification and advertising communication by improving the readability and, therefore, the effectiveness of signs or attention-attracting devices, by preventing their improper placement, over concentration, excessive height, area and bulk and by limiting such items as illumination or animation. 
(4)  Ensuring that the public is not endangered or distracted by the unsafe, disorderly, indiscriminate or unnecessary use of signs and attention-attracting devices, including the promotion of traffic safety by reducing the visual distraction of motorists. 
(5)  Regulating the size, location and content of commercial signage in order to maximize its effectiveness in directing the public to specific buildings and facilities, while meeting the aesthetic goals of the community. 
(6)  Protection of property values by enhancement of the harmony between residential, commercial and industrial uses by reducing visual clutter and preventing blighting influences. 
(7)  Coordination of the type, placement and physical dimensions of signs within the different land areas of the city. 
(8)  Acknowledgment of the differing design concerns and needs for signage in certain specialized areas such as freeway frontages, tourist areas and master planned developments. 
(Code 1967, § 5-91; Ord. No. 1366, § 1, 9-27-1999; Ord. No. 1434, § 1, 12-23-2002) 
Sec. 53-3. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Attention-attracting device means any device or object visible from any public street which is primarily designed to attract the attention of the public to a business, institution, sign, or activity through such means, including but not limited to illumination, color, size or location. Attention-attracting devices or objects often times incorporate illumination, which may be stationary, moving, turning, blinking (including animation) or flashing. Attention-attracting devices may or may not convey a message and can include, but are not limited to, search lights, beacons, strobe lights, strings of lights, electronically controlled message boards (time/temperature signs, gas price signs, public service announcements, etc.), banners, streamers, pennants, propellers and inflatable objects (including strings of balloons) or other devices or objects designed to attract attention. Approved traffic-control devices are not considered to be attention-attracting devices for purposes of this Code. 
    Sandwich board signs means a freestanding temporary sign, with no moving parts or lights, no larger than eight square feet, standing no taller than 42 inches, and no wider than two and one-half feet. They must be constructed of materials that present a finished appearance, as an example, but not limited to, rough-cut plywood is not acceptable. The sign is displayed outside a business during business hours to advertise the business, hours of operation, an event, a promotion, etc. 
(Ord. No. 1366, § 1, 9-27-1999; Ord. No. 1748 , § 1, 4-11-2016) 
Sec. 53-4. - Deviations. 
    The planning commission may grant deviations to this article, based on unique architectural treatments, special project conditions, or specific hardship. Deviations should be considered at the time of planning commission review of the sign scheme for the development, but may be heard subsequent to project review when necessary. The planning commission shall consider the following criteria in acting upon a request for deviation: 
(1)  Purpose and intent of Code. Is granting of the deviation in compliance with the general purpose and intent of the city's signage regulations?> 
(2)  Impacts on adjacent properties. Will granting of the deviation adversely affect neighboring property owners or residents? Is the image presented by the sign or attention-attracting device consistent or compatible with that in the area as a whole? 
(3)  Safety. Will granting of the deviation adversely affect safety? For freestanding signs, a safe sight-distance setback is required, and the sign location must not encroach upon potential future right-of-way needs. The use of signs or attention-attracting devices should not significantly distract traffic on adjacent streets. 
(4)  Visual clutter. Will granting of the proposed deviation significantly clutter the visual landscape of the area? The proposed deviation, in addition to all existing or potential future signs on nearby tracts, should be reviewed for their impact on cluttering the visual landscape. Reductions in the total number of signs or their size may be needed, or setbacks increased, to compensate for other signs and attention-attracting devices in the area. 
(5)  Site constraints. In some situations, topography, landscaping, existing buildings or unusual building design may substantially block visibility of the applicant's existing or proposed signs from multiple directions. While visibility of a sign or attention-attracting device is not to be guaranteed from all directions, deviations may be appropriate to provide reasonable visibility of a business's main sign. 
(6)  Lighting. Sign or attention-attracting device lighting should not disturb residents of nearby residential land uses or adversely affect traffic on adjacent streets. 
(7)  Promotion of high quality, unique design. The proposed signs should be of high quality and must be compatible and integrate aesthetically with daytime/nighttime color, lighting and signs of the development and adjacent buildings. Facade signs may include unique copy design including painting of walls or integration into canopies/awnings, shapes, materials, lighting and other design features compatible with the architecture of the development of surrounding area. Attention-attracting devices should be of a unique, high quality design which accentuates the architecture of the buildings served, versus functioning solely to draw attention to itself. 
(Code 1967, § 5-103; Ord. No. 1366, § 2, 9-27-1999) 
Sec. 53-5. - Prohibited signs.

Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, prohibited signs and attention-attracting devices include, but are not limited to:

c.  Bare bulbs, except for time/temperature devices using bulbs of up to 25 watts.

Abandoned signs shall be removed within three months after meeting the above definition, and any damage to walls, landscaping or other areas shall be repaired to their original condition. 
(5)  Moving signs. Signs with visible moving, revolving or rotating parts or visible mechanical movement of any description or other apparent visible movement achieved by electrical, electronic or mechanical means, or with the optical illusion of movement by means of a design that presents a pattern capable of giving the illusion of motion or changing of copy.

(Code 1967, § 5-94; Ord. No. 1366, § 2, 9-27-1999; Ord. No. 1492, § 1, 11-22-2004) 
Sec. 53-60. - Setback and other location restrictions. 
(a)  Not in public right-of-way. No sign, except government approved traffic-control signs or sandwich board signs, shall be located within the public right-of-way. A projecting sign located on a building abutting the right-of-way may extend into and over the right-of-way, provided such projecting sign shall not exceed 24 square feet and shall be mounted so that the lowest part of the sign is at least eight feet above the adjacent grade. 
(b)  Approval of location in easements. Verification of approval by easement owner may be requested by staff for permanent signs to be located within easements. 
(c)  Setback and location of freestanding signs. Directional or garage sale signs shall be set back five feet from the right-of-way line. All monument, real estate, construction and other freestanding signs shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the right-of-way line.

(e)  Facade signs. 
(1)  For the size, location and placement of facade signs, the term "facade" shall include the entire building elevation parallel to the wall being considered for the facade sign, which is contiguous with the tenant's gross leasable floor area. Plans must be submitted, in the context of a sign scheme, to delineate sign area for each tenant sharing the same exterior wall on which the sign is placed. Plans must reflect adequate sign allowances for all tenants and a cumulative total of the sign area that does not exceed that which is allowable for the building elevation that will accommodate such signs. The sign scheme must present an aesthetic quality that is consistent with the intent of this article. 
(2)  In calculating allowable sign area on a freestanding canopy facade (i.e., fuel pump island canopies and canopies for drive through facilities), the surface area of the facade on which the sign is to be placed, including but not limited to the support posts and face of the canopy shall be considered. If the canopy is attached to a structure or a parent structure exists under or behind the canopy, the facade area of the primary structure may be considered in determining the sign area to be utilized on the canopy. Under no circumstances, however, shall the sign area exceed ten percent of the canopy facade and the sign on the canopy will be allowed only in lieu of a sign on the same side of the building. 
(f)  Signs on awnings. A business identification facade sign may be painted or placed upon an awning if specified in the approved sign scheme for the building.

Sec. 53-67. - Sign schemes. 
(a)  Required. Every multi-tenant building or coordinated development, such as office parks, shopping centers and business parks, shall have a sign scheme approved as part of its final development plan approval. 
(b)  Purpose, format and criteria for review. The general purpose of the sign scheme is to ensure proper business identification while enhancing the quality, harmony and consistency of a project by aesthetically integrating signage into the architecture of each building as well as the development as a whole. The sign scheme must comply with the basic requirements for signs established for the project's uses by this article. The sign scheme shall address the following topics and demonstrate the following characteristics: 
(1)  Identification signs. Designation of the size and location of identification signage proposed for individual tenants. Specifications should anticipate letter style, minimum and maximum letter height, the use of logos, and need for use of double line copy. Sign locations should anticipate impact of pad buildings and landscaping, as well as the provision of adequate spacing between facade signs for effective readability. 
(2)  Appearance. Signs shall be durable, attractive and be designed to complement and reinforce the design themes of the project buildings. Freestanding signage should relate to the building, through the use of similar materials and colors. Facade signage should relate to the design of the building, utilize compatible but contrasting colors, and incorporate high quality materials and illumination. 
(3)  Consistency. Sign design within a development should be generally consistent between tenants and buildings so that the design continuity of the project is maintained. However, it is not necessary for every sign within a particular development to be identical. Differences between major and minor tenants may be appropriate as well as differences between signs on peripheral sites versus signs on a main building. A sign scheme shall generally include at least two of the following characteristics: uniform letter and background colors, uniform letter styles or uniform letter height. In general, as the signs become a smaller portion of the facade, or the architecture becomes more textured or ornate, the need for greater uniformity is lessened. 
(4)  Conversion of existing signs. A sign scheme for an existing development shall include provisions to ensure the ultimate conversion of all existing signs to conform with the approved sign scheme. 
(c)  Approval of proposed schemes. Proposed sign schemes shall be submitted on the forms or in the format prescribed by the community development director. 
(1)  Preliminary sign scheme. A preliminary sign scheme shall be submitted with the application for preliminary plan review for each project requiring sign scheme approval, noting the size and location of all proposed signs. A preliminary sign scheme shall be approved by the Planning commission in conjunction with their preliminary plan approval. 
(2)  Final sign scheme. A final sign scheme shall be submitted with the application for final plan review for each project requiring sign scheme approval. The sign scheme shall provide schematic drawings depicting the dimensions, color, material, lettering style, provision for logos and illumination of all monument and facade signs. The location of all freestanding signs, along with required landscaping, shall be shown on the plans and all facade signs shall be shown on building elevations. A final sign scheme shall be approved by the planning commission in conjunction with their final plan approval. 
(3)  Sign scheme modifications. Minor modifications to a sign scheme that are still within the overall concept and intent of the program, may be approved by the community development director, or upon the director's request, by the planning commission. Major modifications to a sign scheme shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission.

(Code 1967, § 24-168) 
Sec. 59-66. - Use of the right-of-way. 
(a)  The ROW-user's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the city's use or occupation of the right-of-way. The city may reserve sufficient space within the right-of-way for future public improvements. Without limitation of its rights, the city expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the city. 
(b)  The ROW-user shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner that does not interfere with any public improvement and does not compromise public health, safety, and welfare, as reasonably determined by the city. Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvements and as required by the city's Manual of Infrastructure Standards, which is available in the office of the public works director. Such standards shall be competitively neutral and not unreasonable or discriminatory. 
(c)  The ROW-user shall consider any request made by the city concerning placement of facilities in private easements in order to limit or eliminate future street improvement relocation expenses. 
(d)  All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or interfere with any pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems, or other structures or public improvements already installed. In addition, the ROW-user shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the right-of-way or other public lands of the city. 
(e)  All facilities of the ROW-user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of right-of-way and public lands. The city, through its public works director, shall have the right to consult and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being installed. 
(f)  Whenever reasonably possible, all newly constructed facilities shall be located underground. The ROW-user shall comply with all requirements of the city relating to underground facilities. This requirement may be waived by the public works director at his discretion for safety concerns, or some other good cause under the condition that does not cause discrimination among ROW-users. If this requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the public works director, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location and height. Above ground facilities shall comply with the Manual of Infrastructure Standards and all applicable zoning regulations, and be located to minimize any adverse impacts to public health, safety, and welfare. 
(g)  The ROW-user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other ROW-users without their permission. If and when the city requires or negotiates to have a service provider cease using its existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time, except transmission equipment, as defined in 47 CFR 1.40001. 
(h)  The public works director may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is currently, or pursuant to current technology the public works director expects will someday be, located within the right-of-way. All right-of-way permits issued by the public works director shall indicate the proper corridor for the ROW-user's facilities. Any ROW-user whose facilities are currently in the right-of-way in a position at a variance with the designated corridors shall, no later than at the time of next reconstruction or excavation of the area where its facilities are located, move the facilities to its assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the public works director for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as: the remaining economic life of the facilities; public health, safety, and welfare; user service needs; and hardship to the ROW-user. 
(i)  If, in the preparation and planning of a right-of-way project, the public works director deems it appropriate for a conduit to be constructed along, across or under the right-of-way, the public works director shall contact all appropriate ROW-users for their input on the planning and design of such conduit. If a ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such right-of-way, the public works director may require the ROW-user to use such conduit, and to contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided, however, the ROW-user's use of the conduit is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. 
(j)  All earth, sod, landscape features, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the ROW-user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the ROW-user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city. Upon determination by the public works director that such repair or replacement is a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced within 24 hours of notice from the city, or the public works director may direct the city to make such repair or replacement and bill the ROW-user for the city cost. The public works director has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the ROW-user to do any necessary additional work. 
(k)  All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing, use, maintenance, and dismantling of a ROW-user's facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance with the Manual of Infrastructure Standards and all applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, including those promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the ROW-user. It is understood that the standards established in this subsection are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this article may be in addition to or stricter than such minimum standards. 
(l)  A ROW-user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the city right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the public works director and having received a permit for such improvement. The public works director may require that any drawings, plans or specifications submitted be certified by a state registered professional engineer stating that such drawings, plans or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization applying for the permit. 
(m)  The ROW-user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the city and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the city or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the ROW-user without any expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors. 
(n)  The city shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the right-of-way by a ROW-user due to public health, safety and welfare considerations. 
(Code 1967, § 24-170; Ord. No. 1588, § 5, 1-28-2008; Ord. No. 1757 , § 4, 9-26-2016) 
Sec. 59-67. - Facility relocation. 
(a)  The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in the right-of-way as directed by the city for a public improvement or when reasonably required by the city by reason of public health, safety and welfare. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the ROW-user at the ROW-user's sole expense without expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations and schedules of the city pertaining to such. The ROW-user shall proceed with relocations at due diligence upon notice by the city to begin relocation. 
(b)  The ROW-user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in private easement, as directed by the city, for a public improvement, at city expense, by moving such facilities to areas within the expanded right-of-way or within remaining private easements or remaining portions of such easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the city to avoid conflict with city construction and improvements. The ROW-user shall disclaim those parts of its easements which lie within the expanded right-of-way. Should the city, in the future, elect to require the ROW-user to again relocate its facilities to other areas within the expanded right-of-way, the cost of any such future relocation shall be borne by the city. 
(c)  As soon as working drawings are available for public improvements which will require the ROW-user to relocate its facilities, the city shall provide the ROW-user with written notice of relocations and the anticipated bid letting date of the improvement. The ROW-user shall respond with any conflicts and a proposed construction schedule within 30 days. 
(d)  Following notice by the city in the form of the delivery of final design plans for such public improvements, the ROW-user shall remove, and relocate its facilities in accordance with the mutually agreed upon schedule, provided the project is not delayed by adverse weather conditions and other factors beyond the control of the ROW-user. The ROW-user shall certify to the city, in writing, that its facilities have been relocated or adjusted to clear construction in accordance with project plans provided by the city. 
(e)  Any damages suffered by the city, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by ROW-user's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the ROW-user. 
(f)  In the event the ROW-user is required to move its facilities in accordance with this section, any ordinary right-of-way permit fee shall be waived. 
(g)  It is the intent of this section for both the city and the ROW-user to cooperate with one another so that the need for facility relocation is minimized and, when required and feasible, relocations may be completed prior to receipt of bids by the city for a public improvement. 
(h)  In the event that a ROW-user is required to move its facilities for a private benefit, the ROW-user shall not bear the cost of the relocation or adjustment to the extent of such private benefit and the ROW-user shall not be obligated to begin the relocation or adjustment until receipt of funds for such relocation or adjustment. 
(Code 1967, § 24-171; Ord. No. 1757 , § 5, 9-26-2016)

(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the ROW-user to take adequate measures to protect and defend its facilities in the right-of-way from harm and damage. 
(b)  The city shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any of the ROW-user's facilities within the right-of-way as a result of or in connection with any construction, excavation, grading, filling or work of any kind, including public improvements by or on the behalf of the city, except to the extent caused by the negligent, willful, intentional, or malicious acts or omissions of the city. 
(c)  The ROW-user shall be responsible to the city and its agents, representatives, and authorized contractors for all damages suffered by them including, but not limited to delay damages, repair costs, down time, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the ROW-user to timely perform any of its obligations under this article to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the ROW-user. 
(d)  The city or its authorized contractors shall be responsible for taking reasonable precautionary measures including calling for facility locations when constructing its public improvements. 
(e)  Any ROW-user who for any purpose makes or causes to be made any excavation in, upon, under, through or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley or other right-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building or other material during construction or the night time, shall cause the same to be enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption. 
(f)  Whenever a ROW-user shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk, alley, driveway approach or other right-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the excavation until it is refilled as specified. 
(g)  Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely covered. The ROW-user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. 
(h)  The public works director, upon the review and approval of a plan and details for trimming trees in the right-of-way, may grant permission by permit to any ROW-user to trim trees upon and overhanging the right-of-way so as to prevent such trees from coming in contact with the facilities of the ROW-user. 
(i)  In the event the ROW-user severely disturbs or damages the root structure of any tree in the right-of-way to the detriment of the health and safety of the tree, the ROW-user will be required to remove and replace the tree at the ROW-user's cost. The type and size of such replacement tree shall be reasonably determined by the public works director. Further, in review of the ROW-user's plan, public works director, in his discretion, may require the ROW-user to directionally bore around any tree in the right-of-way. 
(j)  Upon the appropriate request of any person having satisfied city procedure and ordinances, the ROW-user shall remove, raise or lower its facilities temporarily or to permit the moving of houses or other structures in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
(Code 1967, § 24-172; Ord. No. 1588, § 5, 1-28-2008) 
Sec. 59-69. - Right-of-way vacation. 
(a)  If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the service provider's facilities, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all service providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same. 
(b)  If the vacation requires the relocation of facilities, and: 
(1)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the service provider, the service provider must pay the relocation costs. 
(2)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the service provider must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city and the service provider. 
(3)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person other than the service provider or the city, such other person must pay the relocation costs. 
(Code 1967, § 24-173) 
Sec. 59-70. - Abandonment and unusable facilities. 
(a)  A ROW-user owning abandoned facilities in the right-of-way must either: 
(1)  Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The public works director may allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the public works director determines that it is in the best interest of public health, safety, and welfare to do so. At such time, the city may take ownership and responsibility of such vacated facilities left in place; or 
(2)  Provide information satisfactory to the city that the ROW-user's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another authorized ROW-user; or 
(3)  Submit to the city a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If the ROW-user proceeds under this section, the city may, at its option, purchase the equipment, require the ROW-user, at its own expense to remove it, or require the ROW-user to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities. 
(b)  Facilities of a ROW-user who fails to comply with this section, and whose facilities remain unused for six months, shall be deemed to be abandoned after the city has made a good faith effort to contact the ROW-user, unless the city receives confirmation that the ROW-user intends to use the facilities. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. 
(c)  The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Abating the nuisance; 
(2)  Taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function; or 
(3)  Requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW-user. 
(Code 1967, § 24-174; Ord. No. 1588, § 6, 1-28-2008; Ord. No. 1757 , § 6, 9-26-2016) 
Sec. 59-71. - Permit requirement. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, no ROW-user may excavate any right-of-way or conduct any repair, construction, or reconstruction of facilities located within the right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. 
(b)  There are two exemptions to this provision: 
(1)  Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public improvements on behalf of the city. 
(2)  ROW-users performing routine service operations which do not require excavation in the right-of-way and do not disrupt traffic for more than four hours. 
(c)  No person owning or occupying any land abutting on a public right-of-way shall construct, maintain, or permit in or on the portion of the public right-of-way to which such land is adjacent, any fixed structure, material or object without having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit.

The public works director may issue a stop work order or a citation to the permittee for any work, which does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions, code or terms of the permit. The stop work order or the citation shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.

(1)  Location. 
a.  The utility provider will work with the city staff and the planning commission to determine a pad size and location that is most appropriate and compatible with the streetscape and adjacent uses, including any adjacent property owner's uses.

In addition, a right-of-way permit shall be obtained for any work associated with the utility structure that will disturb the public right-of-way. Finally, there shall be a preference to the grouping of utility structures where practical, particularly in the right-of-way locations. 
(2)  Landscaping and screening. Unless waived by the planning commission, landscaping or approved alternative screening shall be provided for all large utility structures where necessary to substantially screen the utility structure from public view or the view of adjacent property owners.

Landscape screening should consist of layered plan materials. Maintenance of all landscaping and screening shall be the responsibility of the utility provider, unless written acceptance of such responsibility (running with the land) is provided from the property owner when located within an easement. The planning commission may waive landscaping and screening requirements where not practical or unnecessary.

DIVISION 4. - HOME DAY CARE USES 

Sec. 74-158. - Authorization; purpose.

A group day care home may be permitted as a conditional use after a public hearing is held by the planning commission and a recommendation is forwarded to the city council for final action. The expressed intent behind regulating day care homes and group day care homes is as follows: 
(1)  To preserve the residential character of neighborhoods. 
(2)  To preserve the residential rights of neighbors, while reasonably allowing residents to utilize their residences to enhance or fulfill personal economic goals. 
(3)  To establish reasonable criteria for the operation of day cares in dwelling units. 
(4)  To preserve and protect municipal and utility services such as streets, sewers and water systems against increased utilization typical in commercial districts. 
(5)  To preserve tranquility in neighborhoods and prevent nonresidential activities typically found in commercial districts.

Both related and unrelated children under the age of 16 are counted when determining the maximum number of children allowed in a day care home. Approval of a day care home is conditional upon compliance with all Code and use limitations placed upon such approval. 
The applicant for the day care home shall provide the community development director satisfactory written evidence that the owners of all property within 200 feet of the premises proposed for use as a day care home have been notified of the application and been afforded a period of not less than ten days to submit written comments or objections thereto to the community development director thereto. 
    Group day care home. A child care facility operated out of a single-family unit that cares for a maximum of ten children under the age of 16 at any given time may be permitted by a conditional use permit after a public hearing is held by the planning commission and a recommendation is forwarded to the city council for final action. The notice and public hearing will be done in accordance with the requirements of subsection 50-48(g) of the Merriam Municipal Code. Both related and unrelated children under the age of 16 are counted when determining the maximum number of children allowed in a group day care home.

(a)  In general. 
(1)  A day care home may be operated from a single-family residence or a two-family attached dwelling unit. Group day care homes may only be operated from a single-family residence. A day care home or group day care home operation may only be conducted by those individuals who are primary residents of the residential unit in which the child care facility will be operated. As required by the State of Kansas, an alternate or substitute may be used when extenuating circumstances prevent the primary resident from operating the business. The alternate or substitute may only be utilized on a short term basis. In the event that an alternate or substitute is needed for more than 14 days, the approved provider must make a request in writing to the zoning administrator requesting an extension allowing for a longer substitution. 
(2)  All outside recreation areas for children must be enclosed with a fence. The entire fenced-in recreation area must be on the same portion of the property as the unit in which the day care operation occurs. Access from inside the dwelling unit to the fenced recreation area must also be fenced-in. All fencing must conform to the regulations set forth in section 74-94 of the Merriam Municipal Zoning Code. 
(3)  All day care homes and group day care homes are required to submit to annual inspections to be conducted by the city fire marshal or other designated city official. In addition, inspections may be conducted more frequently if deemed necessary by the fire marshal or other designated city official. 
(b)  Location. Day care homes may be permitted in any single-family unit or two-family, attached dwelling unit subject to the approval of a conditional use permit. Group day care homes may be permitted in any single-family unit subject to the approval of a conditional use permit. Day Care Centers may be located in any approved zoning district as specified in article III of this chapter.

Sec. 74-161. - Complaints and appeals. 
    Complaints concerning day care homes and group day care homes shall be made to the zoning administrator or his/her appointee, or may be initiated by the city. Any person in violation of the home day care requirements and standards shall be notified in writing by the zoning administrator, or a his/her appointee, that a violation of these provisions has occurred, and provide three days from receipt of such notice to cure the violation. In the event such violation is not cured within such time, notice will be sent of the revocation of the conditional use permit. Any person who is aggrieved by the determination that a violation exists may appeal to the planning commission, and shall file an appeal within ten days of the date upon which written notification was issued. If an appeal is filed, the planning commission shall schedule and hold a hearing within 60 days of the filing date of the appeal. The planning commission shall uphold or reverse the determination that a violation exists, and if such violation is found to exist, revoke the conditional use permit. Any party aggrieved by such appeal finding may further appeal to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d).

ARTICLE IV. - PLANNED DISTRICTS 

Sec. 74-295. - Established. 
    Planned zoning procedures are hereby incorporated in this chapter. Planned zoning districts and their equivalent districts are as follows: 
Planned Districts Equivalent District CP-O Planned Office Business C-O CP-1 Planned Neighborhood Shop C-1 CP-2 Planned Retail Business C-2 CP-3 Planned General Commercial C-2 IP-1 Planned Light Industrial I-1  
(Ord. No. 54, art. 4, § 4-401, 12-4-1958) 
Sec. 74-296. - Objectives; administration; standards; application procedure. 
(a)  Statement of objectives. The zoning of land to one of the planning districts shall be for the purpose of encouraging and requiring orderly development on a quality level equal to or greater than that of the equivalent standard zoning districts, but permitting deviations from normal and established development techniques. The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage large scale development tracts, efficient development of small tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning, conservation of natural resources and minimum waste of land. The following are specific guidelines to be applied in the consideration and administration of planned districts. 
(1)  A proposal to rezone land to a planned district shall be subject to the same criteria relative to compliance with the comprehensive plan, land use policies, neighborhood compatibility, adequacy of streets and utilities and other elements, as is normal in rezoning deliberations. 
(2)  The application by the developer and the approval by the city of development plans represents a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans. 
(3)  Deviations in yard requirements, setbacks and relationships between buildings as set out in the zoning district regulations may be approved if it is deemed that other amenities or conditions produce an equal or higher standard and quality of development. 
(4)  Commercial areas will be planned and developed so as to result in attractive, viable and safe centers and clusters, as opposed to strip patterns along thoroughfares. Control of vehicular access, architectural quality, landscaping and signs will be exercised to soften the impact on nearby residential neighborhoods, and to ensure minimum adverse effects on the street system and other services of the community. 
(5)  The developer may be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of land not feasible under application of standard zoning requirements. However, planned zoning shall not be used as a refuge from the requirements of these zoning regulations as to intensity of land use, amount of open space or other established development criteria. 
(6)  No use will be permitted in the planned district that is not clearly permitted in the equivalent district. 
(7)  For the purpose of this chapter, the terms shopping center, business park, office park, industrial park, or any similar grouping of buildings means developments that were planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the zoning was approved by the city. The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt the project or portions thereof from complying with development standards, architectural quality, sign concepts and other conditions that were committed to at the time of rezoning. 
(b)  Local administration agency. The agency having the authority to administer the planned zoning procedures and implementation of projects in connection therewith shall be the city planning commission, together with the city planning staff assigned to assist such commission, subject to approval by the city council. 
(c)  Standards of development. 
(1)  The maximum height of buildings and structures shall be as set out in the equivalent district. 
(2)  The intensity of land use, the bulk of buildings, the concentration of population, and the amount of open space, light and air shall be comparable to that required in the equivalent zoning district. 
(3)  The permitted uses shall be as set out in the equivalent district; provided, however, limitations may be placed on the occupancy of certain premises, if such limitation is deemed essential to the health, safety or general welfare of the community. 
(4)  The city planning commission may require assurance of the financial and administrative capabilities of any agency created by a developer for the purpose of maintaining common open space and facilities of a nonpublic nature. 
(5)  The city planning commission and the city council may, in the process of approving preliminary and final plans, approve deviations from the minimum standards in the equivalent districts. Deviations may be granted by the city planning commission and the city council only where there is ample evidence that the deviation will not adversely affect neighboring property, nor will it constitute the mere granting of a privilege. 
(6)  Reduction of setbacks or other open space shall be compensated by additional open space in other appropriate portions of the project. In all cases, such deviation shall be in keeping with good land planning principles, and must be specifically set out in the minutes of the planning commission, as well as on plans and other exhibits in the records. The parking requirements shall, at a minimum, follow the existing district requirements. 
(7)  The design of all planned projects, whether commercial or industrial, shall be such that adequate access and circulation by firefighting equipment is ensured and may not be retarded by steep grades, heavy landscaping or building spaces. 
(d)  Zoning application procedure for planned districts. 
(1)  Rezoning applications. Applications for rezoning to one of the planned districts shall be administered in the same manner set out in section 50-48. 
(2)  Preliminary development plan. 
a.  General construction work, as hereinafter defined, shall be prohibited in a planned zoning district without an approved final development plan. A preliminary development plan may accompany a rezoning application or may be submitted separately in the case of existing planned zoning districts. In either case, the plan shall be administered in the manner prescribed above for rezoning applications and as follows: 
1.  The plan shall be reviewed by the planning commission and forwarded with its recommendations to the city council. 
2.  The city council shall approve, modify or deny the recommendation; or it may return the plan to the planning commission for further study. 
b.  Plan contents. Section 74-707(a) will be considered as a guideline in determining the information to be included with the preliminary development plan. 
c.  General construction work, definition. General construction work, for determining whether a final development plan will be required in a planned zoning district, consists of a scope of work contained in any one of the following improvements: 
1.  Construction of any new building on the site; 
2.  Additions to a building exceeding five percent of the existing floor area; 
3.  Significant changes to a building exterior relative to building construction materials, color, appearance and signage; or 
4.  Significant changes to the site relative to drainage, grading, parking and driveway layout, landscaping, fencing, signage or other site improvements. 
(3)  Final development plan. General construction work, as defined above, shall be prohibited in a planned zoning district without a final development plan approved by the planning commission, except when such approval is specifically included in an approved preliminary development plan. Final development plans shall not be approved without prior approval of preliminary development plans and shall not deviate significantly from approved preliminary plans. 
(4)  Permitted uses in planned zoning districts. Except as otherwise herein provided, the uses contained in the list of permitted uses in C-O, C-1, C-2, C-3 and I-1 zoning districts are also permitted in CP-O, CP-1, CP-2, CP-3 and IP-1 zoning districts, respectively. Such permitted uses or changes from one permitted use to another permitted use are allowed without further zoning approval by the city, unless uses are specifically limited by an approved preliminary development plan. 
(5)  Conditional uses in planned zoning districts. Conditional uses contained in the list of conditional uses in C-O, C-1, C-2, C-3 and I-1 zoning districts shall not be permitted in planned zoning districts unless specifically allowed by an approved preliminary and a final development plan.

In cases of extreme hardship, the city council may consider granting a permit, or extension thereof, for such period as is warranted under the circumstances. 
(d)  Renewal of a special use permit is not a matter of right. The same discretion shall attach to a decision to renew a special use permit as existed in the original decision to grant or deny that permit; provided, however, that in considering the decision to grant or deny renewal, any factor which would be relevant to consideration of revocation shall also be relevant to consideration of renewal.

Sec. 74-331. - Revocation of special use permits. 
(a)  Basis for revocation. Any special use permit granted under the authority of this article is subject to revocation for any or all of the following reasons: 
(1)  Noncompliance with any applicable requirement set forth in section 74-329. 
(2)  Noncompliance with any special conditions imposed at the time of approval of the special use permit. 
(3)  Violation of any provisions of this Code pertaining to the use of the land, construction or uses of buildings or structures or activities conducted on the premises by the permittee or agents of the permittee. 
(4)  Where conditions in the neighborhood have changed to the extent that approval of the permit would be clearly unwarranted if being applied for at the time of revocation. 
(5)  Violation of any other applicable Code provisions or any state or federal law or regulation by the permittee or agents of the permittee; provided, that such violations relate to the conduct or activity authorized by the special use permit or the qualifications of the permittee or its agents to engage in such conduct or activity. 
(b)  Procedure for revocation. 
(1)  Revocation proceedings may be initiated by a majority vote of the city council. 
(2)  Unless the permittee and landowner agree in writing that the permit may be revoked, the city council shall hold a public hearing to consider the revocation of the special use permit. 
(3)  The city shall give the permittee and landowner notice of the scheduled revocation hearing at least five days prior to the date scheduled for such hearing. If the permittee and landowner are present at the meeting of the city council at which the revocation proceedings are initiated, no further notice shall be required; otherwise, notice shall be given by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. If the notice cannot be delivered or is not accepted, notice may be given by publishing a notice of hearing in the official city newspaper and by posting a notice of hearing on the property at least five days prior to the date scheduled for the hearing. 
(4)  At the hearing, the city attorney or his designee shall present the evidence known to the city that may justify revocation of the special use permit. Testimony may be presented by members of the city staff, planning commission or city council, or by such other witnesses as may be called. Following the presentation of evidence by the city, any person having relevant evidence may present such evidence to the city council. Following the presentation of such evidence, the permittee and landowner shall be entitled to present evidence, including testimony. Following the receipt of all evidence, the public hearing shall be closed. After closing the public hearing, the city council may hear closing statements from the city and the permittee and landowner or their attorney. The city council may render its decision following such closing statements or may take the matter under advisement. 
(5)  No special use permit shall be revoked unless a majority of the city council is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that grounds for revocation exist. Any motion for the revocation of a special use permit shall clearly state the grounds for revocation. In addition, where the basis for revocation is changed conditions, pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section, revocation may only occur upon an explicit finding that revocation is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety or welfare. Adoption of any motion to revoke a special use permit may be made subject to subsequent adoption of written findings of fact and conclusions of law, at the discretion of the city council. 
(6)  An appeal of any decision of the city council to revoke a special use permit shall not suspend the order of revocation during the pendency of the appeal unless so ordered by the county district court.

ARTICLE VI. - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 

Sec. 74-353. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: 
(1)  Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; 
(2)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; 
(3)  Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(4)  Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
(5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(6)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(7)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(8)  Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and 
(9)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to the city's master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

b.  Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be approved by the zoning administrator and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following: 
1.  A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the zoning administrator allows reconstruction as a monopole. 
2.  Height: 
(i)  An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna. 
(ii)  The height change referred to in subsection (1)b.2.i of this section may only occur one time per communication tower. 
(iii)  The additional height referred to in subsection (1)b.2.i of this section shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in section 74-359. The tower's premodification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
3.  On-site location: 
(i)  A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site within 50 feet of its existing location. 
(ii)  After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the site. 
(iii)  A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be measured from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between towers pursuant to section 74-359(b)(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be allowed to cause a violation of section 74-359(b)(5).

g.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
h.  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
(3)  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the zoning administrator, planning commission, or city council related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
g.  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(4)  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
a.  Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75 percent of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line. 
b.  Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
(5)  Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the standard separation requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby. 
a.  Separation from off-site uses/designated areas: 
1.  Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses or designated areas as specified in Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1. 
2.  Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the minimum standards established in Table 1.

Sec. 74-704. - Preamble. 
(a)  The city desires to take full advantage of modern design, construction, technology and planning methods that will advance and promote the sound growth and general welfare of the city; strengthen and sustain it's economic potentials; and provide safe, efficient, economic municipal services and establish appropriate patterns for the distribution of population, commerce and industry in a variety of accommodations which are free and compatible with a modern way of life and are coordinated with the protection and enhancement of natural beauty and resources and in harmony with their surroundings, both within and outside the city. The city also desires to provide parks, playgrounds and recreational facilities in relationship to each other and in conformity to the development of the city as a whole. 
(b)  The municipal administrative authority designated to act under this chapter shall be the city planning commission provided the city council shall also approve all planned unit development as specified herein. 
(c)  The person designated to receive plans shall be the zoning administrator. 
(Ord. No. 54, art. 9, § 9-101, 12-4-1958) 
Sec. 74-705. - General provisions. 
(a)  The city council may by ordinance approve the establishment of a planned unit development district for any parcel or tract of land which is suitable for and which consists of a minimum of 10,000 square feet in size to be planned and developed or redeveloped, as a unit in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter and with the comprehensive plan. By maintaining this architectural control, a form of aesthetics as regards to light, air, open space, green grass, trees, shrubbery, lighting and relationship to other buildings is achieved by the city. 
(b)  A planned unit development district may be established for a residential planned unit development or for a general planned unit development. A development shall be deemed to be a residential planned unit development when it is limited to dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached or multi-storied structures, modular units or any combination thereof; and nonresidential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational or restricted character that are primarily designed and intended to serve the residents of the residential planned unit development. A development shall be deemed to be a general planned unit development when it contains office, commercial or industrial structures and uses exclusively, or when it blends residential structures or dwelling units in a unified plan with office, commercial or industrial structures and uses. 
(c)  Residential, commercial and industrial structures and uses in planned unit development districts shall comply with the limitation of use standards and the applicable bulk regulations, standards for any residential, office, commercial, or industrial district in which any contemplated use is first permitted in this chapter and with the off-street parking and loading requirements contained in article XII of this chapter. These regulations shall apply unless modified by the planning commission or city council. 
(d)  The state statutes annotated which direct the method of establishment of conventional zoning shall not be applied to the improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development. 
(Ord. No. 54, art. 9, § 9-102, 12-4-1958; Ord. No. 1762 , § 9, 3-27-2017) 
Sec. 74-706. - Standards and criteria for planned developments. 
(a)  For all planned developments. A development plan that is consistent with the standards set out in section 74-705 or with such general policies or specific rules and regulations for planned unit development districts as may be adopted from time to time by the city council or the planning commission and placed on public record in the office of the zoning administrator shall be prima facie qualified for preliminary approval. No such policies, rules or regulations shall be revised or added to so as to be applicable to a specific proposal for a planned unit development after an application for preliminary approval of a specific development has been filed. A development plan shall be consistent with the following standards for use of land and the use, type, bulk, design and location of buildings, the density or intensity of use, the common open space, the public facilities and the development by geographic division of the site: 
(1)  The planned unit development can be substantially completed within the period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer. 
(2)  The planned unit development will not substantially injure or damage the use, value and enjoyment of surrounding property or will not hinder or prevent the development of surrounding property in accordance with the recommended land use plan. 
(3)  The site will be accessible from public roads which are adequate to carry the traffic that shall be imposed upon them by the proposed development and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development. Traffic control signals will be provided without expense to the city when the city council determines that such signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets. 
(4)  The development will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities, such as, but not limited to, fire, police protection, streets, and the highway system, stormwater drainage, or sanitary sewers. A stormwater drainage study or a traffic study may be required. 
(5)  The entire tract or parcel of land to be occupied by the planned development shall be contiguous and held in a single ownership, or if there are two or more owners, the application for such planned development shall be filed jointly by all such owners. 
(6)  The development plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of residential buildings, nonresidential uses and structures and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the planned development and are not inconsistent with the best interests of the area. Such covenants, easements and other provisions, if part of the development plan as finally approved, may be modified, removed or released only with the consent of the city council after a public hearing before and with recommendations by the planning commission as provided in section 74-707(b)(1). All such covenants shall specifically provide for enforcement by the city in addition to that of the landowners within the development. Maintenance of stormwater easements shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(7)  The planning commission may designate divisible geographic sections of the entire parcel to be developed as a unit and shall, in such case, specify reasonable periods within which development of each such unit must be commenced. In the case of residential planned unit development and general planned unit developments which contain residential buildings, the planning commission may permit in each unit deviations from the number of dwelling units per acre established for the entire planned unit development, provided such deviation shall be adjusted for in other sections of the development so that the number of dwelling units per acre authorized for the entire planned development is not affected. The period of time established for the completion of the entire development and the commencement date for each section thereof may be modified from time to time by the planning commission, upon the showing of good cause by the developer; provided that in no case shall any extension of time exceed 12 months. The developer shall provide and record easements and covenants, shall make such other arrangements and shall furnish such performance bond, escrow deposit or other financial guarantees as may be determined by the planning commission to be reasonably required to ensure performance in accordance with the development plan and the city subdivision regulations and to protect the public interest in the event of abandonment of the plan before completion. 
(8)  The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a planned unit development not used for structures, parking and loading areas or accessways, shall be landscaped or otherwise aesthetically improved. A portion of the areas being developed shall be devoted to landscape beautification and natural plant growth. The purpose of this requirement is to improve the appearance, environment and value of the total urban area and to protect nearby properties thereby promoting the public health and general welfare. 
(9)  When business or manufacturing structures or uses in a planned unit development district abut a residential district or residential buildings in the same development, screening shall be provided. In no event shall a business or manufacturing structure in a planned development district be located nearer than 100 feet to a residential building outside the development. 
(10)  Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this article, when a shopping center is developed as a planned unit development district, such shopping center shall comply with the provisions of article XII of this chapter. 
(11)  The specifications for the width and surfacing of streets and highways, alleys, ways for public utilities, for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street lights, public parks and playgrounds, school grounds, aesthetic considerations, stormwater drainage, water supply distribution, or sanitary sewers, as established in the subdivision regulations of the city as may be amended from time to time, within the limits hereinafter specified, may be waived or modified by the planning commission where the commission finds that such specifications are not required in the interests of the residents or occupants of the planned unit development and that the waiver or modification of such specifications would not be inconsistent with the interests of the entire city planning area. The city should set out: 
a.  Any customary public service specifications and platting design controls which it will not modify or waive under any circumstances; and 
b.  In cases where it is willing to modify any specifications, the limits of such modifications. 
An example of the former might relate to sewer, water and street design construction standards. Examples of the latter might be to modify or totally waive a requirement for sidewalks or a specified reduction in street widths. 
(12)  Any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the site must be warranted by the design of the development plan and the amenities incorporated in it and must not be inconsistent with the interest of the general public. 
(13)  Private streets may be permitted instead of public streets in dedicated right-of-way. Design standards, contained in chapter 59, shall not be modified for private or public streets. 
(b)  Standards for residential planned unit developments and general planned unit developments containing residential buildings. 
(1)  Any development plan that does not propose to increase the number of dwelling units per acre otherwise applicable to and permitted on the property under this chapter shall be prima facie qualified for preliminary approval regarding residential density. If there are unique and unusual circumstances, a development plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the zoning regulations applicable to the site. However, the developer has the burden to show that such excess density will not have an adverse or undue impact on existing public facilities or on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. In determining the reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre, the planning commission shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by a request for additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public services to be achieved by negotiating: 
a.  The location, amount, and use of common open space. 
b.  The location, design, and type of dwelling units. The planning commission shall also consider that the physical characteristics of a site may make increased densities appropriate in a particular location. 
(2)  When common open space is provided in a development plan, the amount and location of such common open space shall be consistent with the declared function of the common open space as set forth in the application for a planned unit development district. The development plan shall include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space as are reasonably necessary to ensure its continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the city if the common open space is permitted to deteriorate or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest of the planned unit development or of the entire city planning area. 
(3)  When a planned unit development includes common open space and permanent easements, such common open space shall never be used for the construction of any structure, nor shall such open space ever be computed as a part of the required minimum lot area, or any required yard of any other structure. Adequate safeguards, including recorded easements and covenants shall be provided to prevent the subsequent development of, and the future construction of structures on such open space, except for stormwater control structures or public utilities. 
(4)  A minimum of 35 percent of the land area devoted to residential use shall be set aside and developed for open air recreation uses, common open space or green area. Land devoted to residential use is defined as the total noncommercial ground area of the PUD exclusive of the area set aside for nonresidential structures and public streets. The term "common open space" shall be defined as an open green area designed and developed primarily for the use and benefit of the residents of the development for recreation, courts, gardens, or open space; it shall not include space devoted to public or private streets, and parking for residential and nonresidential uses. 
(5)  Nonresidential uses of a religious, educational or recreational nature shall be designed or intended primarily for the use of the residents of the planned unit development. 
(6)  Nonresidential uses of a business character shall be designed or intended to serve principally the residents of the planned unit development. No structure designed or intended to be used, in part or in whole, for commercial or office purposes shall be constructed prior to the construction of less than 50 percent of the dwelling units proposed in the development plan. 
(7)  Planned unit developments in areas that are on the fringes of urban development or are in largely undeveloped areas shall maintain the following minimum yards: 
a.  The distance at the closest point between any structure and the boundary of the lot shall be at least two times the perpendicular distance from the lowest first floor window sill to the highest point on the roof of the structure. 
b.  When two or more structures are located in any proposed planned unit development, the distance at the closest point between any two structures containing residential uses or between a structure containing residential uses and any other structure, shall be equal to two times the perpendicular distance from the lowest first-floor window sill of any structure containing residential uses to the highest point on the roof of the other structure. 
(Ord. No. 54, art. 9, § 9-103, 12-4-1958) 
Sec. 74-707. - Procedure for securing approval. 
(a)  Preliminary development plan. 
(1)  A developer seeking the establishment of a planned unit development district shall prepare and submit to the planning commission a preliminary development plan for such planned unit development district. 
(2)  The preliminary development plan shall contain the following documents and information: 
a.  A survey of the tract that is to be developed showing the existing features of the property, including streets, alleys, easements, utility lines, existing land use, general topography, stormwater channels and physical features. 
b.  A site plan showing the location and arrangement of all existing and proposed structures, the proposed traffic circulation pattern within the development, the areas to be developed for parking, the points of ingress and egress, including access streets where required, the relationship of abutting land uses and zoning districts, proposed lots and blocks, if any, and proposed public or common open space, if any, including parks, playgrounds, school sites, sidewalks and recreational facilities. 
c.  A preliminary plat of subdivision for which approval has been secured pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations relating to the city subdivision regulations. 
d.  A statement documenting the anticipated residential density (when applicable), the proposed total gross floor area, and the percentage of the development which is to be occupied by structures. 
e.  Preliminary sketches of the proposed structures, parking, lighting and landscaping. 
f.  When a planned unit development is to be constructed in stages or units, a schedule for the development of such stages or units shall be submitted. No such stage or unit shall have a residential density that exceeds by more than 20 percent the proposed residential density of the entire planned development. When a planned unit development provides for common open space, the total area of common open space provided at any stage of development shall, at a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire planned unit development as the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire planned unit development. 
g.  Evidence must be submitted documenting that the applicant has sufficient control over the tract to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the tract of land and the proposed development. 
h.  When it deems it to be necessary, the planning commission may require a traffic study analyzing the effect that the planned unit development will have upon traffic in the streets in an effort to minimize the burden of traffic on streets, highways and thoroughfares adjacent to and in the vicinity of the proposed development. 
i.  A statement showing the relationship of the planned unit development to the comprehensive plan and future land use plan for the city planning area. 
j.  In the case of a general planned unit development, a statement identifying the principal types of business or industrial uses that are to be included in the proposed development. 
k.  When a planned unit development includes provisions for common open space, permanent easements or recreational facilities, a statement is required describing the provision made for the care and maintenance of such open space or recreational facilities. If it is proposed that such open space be owned or maintained by any entity other than a governmental authority, copies of the proposed articles of incorporation and by-laws of such entity shall be submitted. 
l.  Copies of any restrictive covenants that are to be recorded with respect to property included in the planned unit development district. 
m.  Sketches showing the size, type and location of signs, which shall conform to the provisions of chapter 53. 
n.  A stormwater management study by a licensed engineer. 
o.  When deemed necessary, the planning commission may require an environmental impact study. Such study shall be prepared by a qualified independent person or agency. 
(b)  Action on preliminary development plan. 
(1)  Hearing, findings and recommendation of planning commission. The planning commission shall, within 60 days after a preliminary development plan is filed, hold a public hearing on the preliminary development plan after giving the notice required by section 50-48 for hearings on amendments. Such public hearing shall consider all aspects of the preliminary development plan including all proposed stages or units of development. Within 30 days after the last public hearing on such plan, the planning commission shall prepare and transmit to the city council and to the developer specific findings of fact with respect to the extent to which the preliminary development plan complies with the standards set out in this section, together with its recommendations to the city council with respect to the action to be taken on the preliminary development plan. The commission may recommend disapproval, approval or approval with amendments, conditions or restrictions. Copies of the findings and recommendations of the planning commission shall be made available to any other interested persons. 
(2)  Action by the city council. The city council shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plan within 30 days after it has received the findings and recommendations of the planning commission. If the preliminary development plan is disapproved, the developer shall be furnished with a written statement of the reasons for disapproval. If the preliminary development plan is approved and a valid protest petition has been submitted, the signers of the petition shall be furnished with a written statement of the reasons for approval. If the preliminary development plan is approved, the city council shall, after receiving from the developer any acceptance required by subsection (b)(3) of this section, adopt an ordinance approving the preliminary development plan and establishing a planned unit development district for the parcel or tract of land included in the preliminary development plan. 
(3)  Disapproval of planning commission recommendation or modification or changes in preliminary plan. 
a.  The city council may disapprove the recommendation of the planning commission. When so disapproved, the city council shall return such recommendation to the planning commission with a statement specifying the basis for disapproval or the need for further study. 
b.  The city council may modify or alter the preliminary development plan and impose such restrictions and conditions on the planned development as it may deem necessary to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and with the comprehensive plan of the city. 
c.  When the city council requests a modification or alters the design or density of the development plan, the recommendations shall be returned to the planning commission and the developer shall have 45 days to accept such changes and file an amended preliminary plan with the planning commission. The city council shall take no action approving a preliminary development plan and establishing a planned unit development district until such acceptance is filed with and acted upon by the planning commission and their recommendation forwarded to the city council for consideration. 
(4)  Restrictions, covenants or conditions. The city council may impose restrictions, covenants or conditions on the planned development as it deems necessary to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. When such action is taken, the developer shall have 15 days within which to file an acceptance of such restrictions, covenants or conditions with the city council. When an acceptance is required by this section, no action approving a preliminary development plan and establishing a planned unit development district shall be taken until such acceptance has been filed with the city council. 
(5)  Form of approval. 
a.  An ordinance adopted by the city council approving a planned development and establishing a planned unit development district shall specify the zoning regulations and restrictions that will, pursuant to the development plan, apply in the planned development district and shall describe the boundaries of such district or set such boundaries out on a map that is incorporated and published as a part of such motion. 
b.  Such ordinance shall also specify the conditions and restrictions that have been imposed by the city council on the planned unit development and the extent to which the otherwise applicable district regulations have been varied or modified. When the planning commission has designated divisible geographic sections of the development that may be developed as a unit, the motion shall authorize the planning commission to modify the schedule of development to the extent set out in section 74-706(a)(7). 
(Ord. No. 54, art. 9, § 9-104, 12-4-1958) 
Sec. 74-708. - Status of preliminary development plan after approval. 
(a)  Within seven days after the adoption of a motion by the city council approving a preliminary development plan and establishing a planned unit development district, such minutes shall be certified by the clerk of the city and shall be filed in the office of the zoning administrator. A certified copy shall be mailed to the developer. 
(b)  Preliminary approval of a development plan shall not qualify a planned unit development for recording. A development plan, which has been given preliminary approval as submitted or which has been given preliminary approval with alterations, conditions and restrictions which have been accepted by the developer, and the developer has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the preliminary approval, shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by the action of the city pending an application or applications for approval of a final development plan without the consent of the developer. An application for final approval shall be filed, or in the case of staged developments, applications shall be filed, within the time specified in the ordinance granting approval of the preliminary plan. If no time is specified in the ordinance regarding the granting of approval of the preliminary plan, then an application for approval of the final development plan or all stages thereof, shall be filed within one year. 
(c)  In the event that a development plan is given preliminary approval and thereafter, but prior to approval of final development plan, the developer shall: 
(1)  Choose to abandon the plan and shall so notify the planning commission in writing; or 
(2)  Fail to file an application or applications for approval of a final plan within the required time period, the preliminary plan shall be deemed to be revoked. 
(d)  When a preliminary plan is revoked, all that portion of the preliminary plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those provisions of the zoning regulations and other legal ordinances that were applicable thereto immediately prior to the approval of the preliminary plan, as they may be amended from time to time. The city council shall forthwith adopt an ordinance repealing the planned unit development district of any portion of the development that has not received final approval and reestablish the prior zoning and other regulatory provisions that would otherwise be applicable. 
(e)  The city council's approval of the preliminary planned unit development plan does not imply any permission to begin grading or any other work in a planned unit development district; provided, however, that the planning commission, in its sole discretion, may authorize the issuance of permits for demolition of existing structures, removal of subsurface improvements, rough grading of the site and installation of utility or drainage improvements prior to approval of a final planned unit development plan. 
(Ord. No. 54, art. 9, § 9-105, 12-4-1958; Ord. No. 1250, § 1, 9-25-1995) 
Sec. 74-709. - Application for approval of final development plan. 
(a)  Application for approval. 
(1)  An application for approval of a final development plan may be filed for all the land included in a planned unit development or for a stage or unit thereof. Such application shall be filed by the developer with the planning commission within the time specified in section 74-706(b) and shall be in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan as approved. The application shall include: 
a.  A detailed site plan showing the physical layout and design of all streets, easements, rights-of-way, lots, sidewalks, parking, blocks, green space, structures and uses. 
b.  Preliminary building plans, including floor plans and exterior elevations. 
c.  Landscaping plans. 
d.  Copies of any easements and restrictive covenants and proof of recording of the same. 
e.  Proof of the establishment and activation of any entity that is to be responsible for the management and maintenance of any common open space. 
f.  Evidence that no lots, parcels, tracts or dwelling units in such development have been conveyed or leased prior to the recording of any restrictive covenants applicable to such planned development. 
g.  Such bonds and other documents that may have been required pursuant to sections 74-706(a)(7), 74-707(b)(4), and 74-707(b)(5). 
h.  Drawings showing size, type and location of signs. 
i.  Final lighting plan. 
j.  Final stormwater control plan. 
(2)  In accordance with the schedule proposed in the application for approval of the preliminary plan, the developer may elect to file an application for final approval of only a geographic unit or units of the land included in the plan and may delay, within the time limits authorized by the city council, application for final approval of other units. A public hearing by the planning commission on an application for approval of the final development plan or a unit thereof shall not be required, provided that the final plan for the unit thereof submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan theretofore given approval. 
(b)  A public hearing is not required if the development plan submitted for final approval shall be in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved. 
(c)  Although a public hearing need not be held on an application for approval of a final development plan when the plan as submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the burden shall be upon the developer to show the planning commission good cause for any variations between the preliminary plan, as approved, and the final development plan as submitted. In the event a public hearing is not required for final approval, and the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other documents required in support thereof, the planning commission shall, within 45 days of such filing, grant such plan final approval; provided, however, that in the event the final plan as submitted contains variations from the preliminary plan, as approved, but remains in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the planning commission may, after a meeting with the developer, refuse to approve the final plan and shall, within 45 days from the filing of the final development plan for final approval, so advise the developer in writing of such refusal setting out the reasons why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the developer may refile his final development plan for final approval without the variation objected to by the planning commission at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval. If the time for applying for final approval shall have expired at the time when the planning commission advised the developer that the variations were not in the public interest, then the developer shall have 60 additional days within which to refile his final development plan for final approval without the variation. If the developer shall fail to refile within the period, he shall be deemed to have refused to accept such requirements and final approval shall be deemed to have been denied. 
(d)  In the event the final development plan, as submitted for approval, is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the planning commission shall, within 14 days of the date the application for approval of the final plan is filed, so notify the developer in writing, setting out the particular ways in which the final plan is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved. The developer may make such changes in the final plan as are necessary to bring it into compliance with the preliminary plan, and he may file a written request with the planning commission that it hold a public hearing on his application for final approval. The developer may take either such alternative action at any time within which he would be entitled to apply for final approval, or within 60 additional days if the time for applying for final approval shall have expired at the time when the planning commission advised the developer that the final plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the developer shall fail to take either of these alternative actions within the time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the plan. Such public hearing shall be held, notice thereof shall be given, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in sections 50-19 through 50-21, 50-46, and 50-47. Within 30 days after the conclusion of the public hearing, the planning commission shall by resolution either grant or deny approval of the final plan. The denial or approval of the final plan shall, in cases arising under this subsection (d), be in the form and contain the findings required for a recommendation on an application for approval of a preliminary development plan set out in section 74-707(a). 
(e)  A final development plan or any unit thereof that has been approved by the planning commission shall be so certified without delay by the clerk of the city and shall be filed of record in the office of the zoning administrator before any development shall take place in accordance therewith. In the event the planning commission fails to act, either by grant or by denial of final approval within the time prescribed, the final plan shall be deemed to be approved by the planning commission and shall be forwarded to the city council for final approval. Pending completion within a reasonable time of the planned development or of any unit thereof, that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of the plan or unit thereof as finally approved, shall be made by the city except with the consent of the developer. When final approval has been granted, the same shall be noted on the zoning map by the zoning administrator. 
(f)  In the event that a final development plan or unit thereof is approved, and thereafter the developer shall: 
(1)  Abandon part of all of the development plan and shall so notify the planning commission in writing; or 
(2)  Fail to commence the planned development or unit thereof within 180 days after final approval has been granted, then no development or further development shall take place on the property included in the final development plan until after the property has been reclassified by enactment of an amendment to this chapter in the manner prescribed for such amendments in sections 50-19 through 50-21, 50-46 and 50-47.

Sec. 74-710. - Amendments. 
(a)  Planned development district ordinance or an approved preliminary or final development plan may be amended by the city council, but only after a public hearing has been held pursuant to notice as set forth in section 50-48, and findings of fact and recommendations have been prepared by the planning commission and transmitted to the city council in the manner required by section 74-705(b)(1) hereof. 
(b)  The procedure in subsection (a) of this section shall also apply if the use of an existing building or structure within a planned unit development is to be changed.
