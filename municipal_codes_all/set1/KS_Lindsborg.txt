PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lindsborg, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Gregory A. DuMars, City Administrator; Jerry Lovett-Sperling, City Clerk; and William Gusenius, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a code of ordinances that will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of this Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in this Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections through " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of this Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into this Code); and

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 50-749. - Purpose; findings of fact; intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content-neutral and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. 
(b)  The city has a national and international reputation in fine arts and as a unique Swedish community. Toward this end, the city council finds that the city depends on tourism as an important part of the economy. Signage has a significant impact on the visual character and quality of the city. 
(c)  The proliferation of signs in the city would result in visual blight and unattractiveness and would convey an image that is inconsistent with a high quality environment. Effective sign control has preserved and enhanced the visual character of other communities in this state and other states. The city must compete with many other state, national and international tourist communities for tourism opportunities. 
(d)  In order to preserve the city as a desirable community to live, vacation and conduct business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. 
(e)  These sign regulations are intended to: 
(1)  Preserve and maintain the city as a pleasing, visually attractive environment. 
(2)  Promote and accomplish the goals, policies and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Address community needs, preserve the unique natural environment, preserve and enhance the quality human existence, retain the city's premier status in an increasingly competitive tourist market, preserve the historically and architecturally unique character of the city, foster the Swedish quality of the city and preserve and enhance scenic views. 
(4)  Enable the identification of places of residence and business. 
(5)  Allow for the communication of information necessary for the conduct of commerce. 
(6)  Permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation and preclude placement in a manner that conceals or obstructs adjacent land uses or signs. 
(7)  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site or adjoining sites. 
(8)  Curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business. 
(9)  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot's street frontage and building's street frontage along where the sign is to be placed. 
(10)  Protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs and require signs to be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner. 
(11)  Lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation and excessive height, area and bulk of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(12)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians. 
(13)  Avoid the creation of a "tourist trap" atmosphere that can result when business enterprises compete for attention through the use of commercial advertising signs. 
(14)  Impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions upon commercial signs while, at the same time, not unnecessarily or impermissibly interfering with the free exercise rights granted under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and related areas of the state constitution.

(5)  The dimensions, measurements, and calculations of building frontages and line frontages on streets and alleys; the dimensions of any other sign located on the property; and any other information needed to calculate permitted sign area, height, type, placement or other requirements of these regulations.

(c)  Subdivision plats shall conform to the following general guidelines: 
(1)  All portions of a tract being subdivided, unless otherwise permitted, shall be designed as lots, streets, planned open spaces or other uses to avoid the creation of vacant landlocked spaces. 
(2)  Subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out so as to avoid the necessity for excessive cut and fill. 
(3)  Whenever possible, developers shall preserve trees, groves, waterways, scenic points, historic sites and other local assets and landmarks.

Sec. 51-129. - Character of the land. 
(a)  Land which the planning commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development, due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formation, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the planning commission to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. 
(b)  No land subject to a flood having a chance occurrence in any one year of one percent including, but not limited to, areas identified by the Federal Flood Insurance Administrator as having special flood hazards, shall be subdivided for residential use or any other use which would be incompatible with such flooding except as provided in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this secton: 
(1)  Land subject to periodic flooding, or which has inadequate drainage, may be subdivided only if improvements or structures are designed by an engineer so as to ensure adequate floodproofing. Proposals for the subdivision of land in such areas shall include engineering evidence that the proposed development will:

b.  Not result in an increase in the height of the floodwater of more than one foot. 
c.  Require residential structures to have the lowest floor (including basement) to be at least one foot above such flood level or nonresidential structures to be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above such flood level. 
d.  Meet all zoning requirements for identified flood hazard areas. 
(2)  New or replacement water supply and/or sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.

Sec. 51-130. - Streets, alleys and public ways. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform: 
(1)  To the intent of the comprehensive plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets; 
(2)  To the reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; 
(3)  To topographical conditions; 
(4)  To the runoff of stormwater; 
(5)  To public convenience and safety; and 
(6)  In their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(b)  Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building sites. 
(c)  Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs, to permit future street extensions into adjoining tracts or when designed as cul-de-sacs with turnaround provisions. 
(d)  Stub streets, greater in length than one lot depth, shall be provided with a temporary turnaround to the standards required for cul-de-sacs, or shall be paved to the full width of the right-of-way for the last 50 feet of their length. 
(e)  Streets that are obviously in alignment with other already existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street names should not be similar to already platted street names. 
(f)  Arterial streets through subdivisions shall conform to the major street plan of the comprehensive plan as adopted by the planning commission and the governing body. 
(g)  Local streets should be designed so as to discourage through or nonlocal traffic. Local streets should not intersect arterial streets. 
(h)  Cul-de-sacs shall meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  The maximum length of a cul-de-sac street shall be 500 feet, but the planning commission may approve a length of 1,000 feet if conditions warrant.

(3)  Drainage of a cul-de-sac shall preferably be toward the open end. 
(i)  Where lots front or side, but do not back, on railroad rights-of-way, major streets, or highways, a marginal access street, or frontage road shall be provided, parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way. The distance of the street from said right-of-way shall be determined with due consideration given to minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations or intersections. The right-of-way of such frontage road shall be 60 feet, unless otherwise approved. 
(j)  The planning commission may recommend to the city council that the requirement for a frontage road be waived if: 
(1)  Existing physical conditions make it improbable that a frontage road would be constructed. 
(2)  A hardship is created and the full use of the property cannot be obtained for lots or tracts that existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(k)  Dedication of half-streets will not be approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and is in conformity with the approved major street plan and other requirements of these regulations. In addition, satisfactory assurance that dedication of the remaining part of the street will occur in a reasonable length of time will be required. 
(l)  Consideration of the need for sidewalks and other pedestrian ways shall be included in the subdivision design process. Requirements for sidewalks shall be as set out by these regulations and as determined necessary by the planning commission. 
(m)  All streets, alleys and public ways included in any subdivision, hereafter dedicated and accepted, shall be not less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows:

These minimum dimensions may be modified by the city, as necessary, to allow for special conditions such as parallel drainage and roadway systems, utility requirements, provision for pedestrian movement, grade problems, intersection design, and similar considerations in the process of establishing a safe and efficient street system. 
(n)  To ensure proper street layout and function, street alignment shall conform to the following: 
(1)  Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of five degrees, connection shall be made by horizontal curves. 
(2)  Residential streets should approach major streets at an angle of not less than 80 degrees or more than 100 degrees. 
(3)  Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(4)  Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all curves depending upon design speed. These distances shall be: 
Feet Horizontal  Arterial streets 500  Collector streets 300  Local streets 200 Vertical  Arterial streets 350  Collector streets 300  Local streets 200  
The sight distance shall be measured within street rights-of-way from a height of 41/2 feet above the proposed pavement surface in the roadway's righthand lane. 
(5)  Street jogs should be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets, centerline offsets of less than 150 feet should be avoided. 
(6)  Multiple street intersection involving the junction of more than two streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such intersection shall be designed with extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety. 
(o)  Street and roadway grades should not exceed the following recommended standards: 
(1)  Centerline grades should not be less than one percent. 
(2)  The maximum street grades for residential streets should be no greater than ten percent. 
(p)  No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be used where they are or would be logical extensions of existing streets even though separated by undeveloped land. 
(q)  Clear sight triangles of 90 feet measured along the street centerlines from their points of junction shall be provided at all intersections, and no obstruction shall be higher than two feet above the centerlines within the sight triangle. 
(r)  Alleys shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)  Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the planning commission may recommend waiving this requirement where another definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys in residential districts are optional, unless recommended by the planning commission. 
(2)  When provided, the minimum width of an alley shall be 20 feet. 
(3)  Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, a turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(4)  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end. 
(s)  Where alleys are not provided, permanent easements of not less than ten feet in width shall be provided on all rear lot lines, and on side lot lines where necessary, for: utility poles, wires, and conduits; sanitary sewers; gas, water and heating mains; and other public utilities and drainage requirements. 
(1)  A 12-foot temporary construction easement shall be provided on each side of the permanent easement required above for initial construction of water, sewer and other utility lines. 
(2)  Where a lot or group of lots side or back on an existing high-pressure oil line or existing high-pressure gas line, a 75-foot easement shall be provided on each side of said oil line or gas line. The 75-foot easement shall be provided on that part of the lot that abuts the oil line or gas line and no building or structure shall be located or constructed within said 75-foot easement. 
(t)  If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, or channel, a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to provide adequate stormwater drainage and for access for maintenance purposes. 
(Ord. No. 4277, § 21-6.04, 5-5-2003) 
Sec. 51-131. - Blocks. 
(a)  The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the following:
