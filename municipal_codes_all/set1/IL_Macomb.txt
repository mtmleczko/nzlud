PREFACE
This Code constitutes a republication of the 1972 Municipal Code of the City of
Macomb, Illinois.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as
supplemented through September 18, 1990. Those ordinances amendatory of the Code
subsequent to September 18, 1990, through Ordinance No. 2446, adopted December 3, 1990,
have also been included. The code has also been revised pursuant to the revision ordinance
prepared by the city attorney's office during the summer of 1991, which changes are
effectuated by the ordinance readopting this Code.
As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not
included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains
only ordinances of a general and permanent nature, prescribed for and affecting the public as
a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the
city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special
assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc.,
are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are
not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order
and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate
usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer
to relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the
Code.
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state
and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a
dash, the figure before the dash referring to chapter number and the figure after the dash
referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is
numbered 1-1 and the twelfth section of Chapter 20 is 20-12. Under this system, each section
is identified by its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper
places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new
material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is
desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively.
New chapters may be included in the same manner. For example, if the new
material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5.
Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when
including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in
the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the
case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next
successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division.
The page numbering system used in this Code is a modern system which uses a
prefix system as follows:
CODE CD1:1
CODE APPENDIX CDA:1
CDB:1
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1
STATE LAW REFERENCE
TABLES
SLT:1
CODE INDEX CDi:1
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental
servicing of the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the
final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages
affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of Codes with
instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each
such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided
in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder
of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to
have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly
recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt
to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for
historical reference.
The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each
particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched
in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by
city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which
stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
The publication of this Code as originally published in 1972 was under the direct
supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Thomas B. Calhoun, Editor, of the
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. This republication was under the direct
supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Code Editor. Credit
is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and
able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Bruce J. Biagini, former City Attorney, and Mr.
James D. Lee, current City Attorney, for their cooperation and interest during the progress of
the work on the republication of this Code.
This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of
Macomb, Illinois.

purpose of consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. Formal rules

chief of police or his designee determines that probable cause does not exist to

premises, the city shall return the money to its rightful owner. If the chief of
police or his designee finds that there is probable cause to believe the money

of consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises, the chief of police or
his designee shall order the continued holding of the funds until after a forfeiture
hearing.

beverages on the premises. At the hearing, formal rules of evidence shall not
apply, and hearsay shall be permitted. Any person claiming an interest in the
money shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and be heard. If the

or sale of items for the purpose of consumption of alcoholic beverages on the
premises as set forth in section 4-51(a) or (b) or section 4-112 of this Code, the
city administrator or his designee shall declare the money forfeited to the city
and that any claim of any person to the money is extinguished. If the city
administrator or his designee determines that the money, or any portion thereof,
was not the proceeds of an unlawful sale, the city shall promptly remit the
money (or portion thereof) to the rightful owner. After 21 days after notice of
seizure has been sent, pursuant to this section, and no written request for a
forfeiture hearing has been received, the money shall be forfeited, and any

normal and regular basis throughout the license year. If, at any time during the license year, a
licensee's business is not in operation for a continuous period of 60 days, then the licensee's
failure to operate the business shall be a prima facie violation of this section. A licensee may
establish a bona fide reason for not operating his business, such as by showing that the
business is closed for vacation, for remodeling, because of serious illness of the business
owner, or for some other reasonable purpose. The commissioner may suspend any licensee's
license temporarily for violation of this section and until proper business operations are

Sec. 7-71. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, word or phrases used in this document shall
be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as
to give this document its most reasonable application.
Development means any manmade change to real estate including but not
limited to construction or reconstruction of buildings, installing manufactured homes or travel
trailers, installing utilities, construction of roads or bridges, erection of levees, walls, or fences,
drilling, mining, filling, dredging, and storage of materials.
Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation,
or the runoff of surface water from any source.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source (see "flood").
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or
improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections,
that is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to required utilities.
New construction for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM
or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for
which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
Person means and includes any individuals, corporations, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies.
Special flood hazard area means the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be
designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed rate making has been completed in
preparation for publication of the flood insurance map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A,
AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE or
V. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in
meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
Structure means for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including gas or liquid storage tanks, that is principally above ground. The term
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers on site for more than 180 days.
Substantial improvements means any repair, reconstructions, or improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the
structure either (a) before the improvement or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been
damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of definition,
"substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alternation affects
the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any
alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register
of Historic Places.

grantor shall not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to

or requirements of this chapter or the adult establishment license issued
pursuant hereto, or the provisions of the city zoning ordinance applicable
to the licensed premises or the adult entertainment establishment.

may be suspended for not more than 30 days or revoked pursuant to the terms
and conditions set forth in this article.

the grounds for suspension or revocation under subsection (a) may exist,
the adult use commissioner shall serve a written notice on the licensee in
person or by certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt

licensee's application. The written notice shall, at a minimum, state that
the adult use commissioner has determined that the adult establishment
license may be subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to
subsection 14-267(a); identify the specific grounds for the adult use
commissioner's determination; and set a date for a hearing regarding the
adult use commissioner's determination as to the possibility of
suspension or revocation of the adult establishment license. The date of

submit evidence and witnesses to refute the grounds cited by the adult
use commissioner for suspending or revoking the license and the city
and any other persons may submit evidence to sustain such grounds. All
witnesses that appear and testify at the hearing shall be sworn and strict
rules of evidence shall not apply. Evidence that is commonly relied upon
by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their business may be
admitted and evidence determined to be irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly
repetitious may be excluded at the determination of the adult use
commissioner. The administrative record complied on the adult
entertainment establishment pursuant to section 14-268 shall be made
part of the hearing record. Within three days after the close of the
hearing, the adult use commissioner shall, having considered the record
made at the hearing, render a decision in writing, setting forth the
reasons for the decision. If an official record of the proceedings is
required to be prepared and certified by a certified court reporter or a
certified short-hand reporter, such as for appeal purposes, the cost of

security submitted for the adult entertainment establishment pursuant to
subsection 14-256(b)(2) shall be forfeited as the adult use commissioner
shall deem necessary to reimburse the city for the costs associated with
the proceedings related to the suspension or revocation at issue. Such
bond or other security shall be replenished to equal the amount required
pursuant to subsection 14-256(b)(2) prior to the issuance of any new
adult establishment license for the licensed premises or for the
reinstatement of any suspended license.

breath or other bodily substance, shall be admissible. Where such test is
made the following provisions shall apply:
a. Chemical analyses of the
person's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance, to be
considered valid under the provisions of this section, shall have

department of public health shall prescribe regulations as
necessary to implement this subsection.

by the department of public health may withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug
content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of
breath or urine specimens.
c. The person tested may have a
physician or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse or
other qualified person of his own choosing administer a chemical

person's blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the
person's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall give rise to
the following presumptions:
a. If there was at that time an
alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that
the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
b. If there was at that time an
alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.10, such
facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was
or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining
whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
c. If there was at that time an
alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it shall be presumed that
the person was under the influence of alcohol.
d. The provisions of this
subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of
any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether
the person was under the influence of alcohol.
(3) If a person under arrest refuses to
submit to a chemical test under the provisions of this section, evidence
of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding
arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person

stopped in the opposing roadway, and need not stop such vehicle when driving
upon a controlled access highway when passing a school bus traveling in either
direction that is stopped in a loading zone adjacent to the surfaced or improved
part of the controlled access highway where pedestrians are not permitted to
cross.
(f) The secretary of state shall suspend for a period of 30
days the driving privileges of any person convicted of a violation of subsection

grant, for the duration of any suspension issued under this subsection, a
restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between
the driver's residence and place of employment or within other proper limits that
the secretary of state shall find necessary to avoid any undue hardship. A
restricted driving permit issued under this subsection shall be subject to
cancellation, revocation and suspension by the secretary of state in like manner
and for like cause as a driver's license may be cancelled, revoked or
suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or
ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause
for the revocation, suspension or cancellation of the restricted driving permit.
The secretary of state may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving
permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or
rehabilitative program. Any conviction for a violation of this subsection shall be
included as an offense for the purposes of determining suspension action under
any other provision of this chapter, provided, however, that the penalties
provided under this subsection shall be imposed unless those penalties
imposed under other applicable provisions are greater.

subsection (a) of this section shall, upon appropriate demand by an authorized
prosecutor acting in response to a signed complaint, provide a written statement
or deposition identifying the operator of the vehicle if such operator was not the
owner at the time of the alleged violation. Failure to supply such information
shall be construed to be the same as a violation of subsection (a) of this section
and shall be subject to the same penalties provided in this section. If the owner
has assigned control for the use of the vehicle to another, the person to whom
control was assigned shall comply with the provisions of this subsection and be
subject to the same penalties as provided in this subsection.

Sec. 17-56. Applicability.
(a) This chapter shall be effective within the corporate
limits of the City of Macomb and its contiguous area as defined herein.
(b) After the effective date of this chapter, no buildings,
structures, uses of land, lots of record or zoning lots shall be established,
altered, moved, divided or maintained except in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter. Existing buildings, structures and uses of land that do not
comply with the regulations of this chapter are pursuant to Article II, Division 3,
Nonconformities.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-57. Interpretation.
The city planning commission has given careful consideration to the future
probable use of land in the area affected by this chapter, and has had prepared "The
Comprehensive Plan of Macomb, Illinois," showing the future development of this area, which
has served as a guide for the interpretation of this chapter. All general provisions, terms,
phrases, and expressions contained in this chapter shall be liberally construed in order that the
intent of the city council may be fully carried out. These provisions shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public peace, health, safety, morals,
convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following additional rules of interpretation
shall apply:
(1) In the event of a conflict between the text of
these provisions and any caption, figure, illustration, table, or map; the text of
these provisions shall control;
(2) Word usage shall be governed by the
standards of Article II, Division 1, section 17-41, Rules of Word Usage.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-58. Transition rules.
In determining the applicability of this chapter with respect to the previously
applicable zoning regulations, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Pending permits and licenses. No permit for the
erection or placement of any building or structure, or license or permit for the
conduct of any use, shall be issued for a period of three months after the
question of amending the zoning ordinance in a manner which would prohibit
the proposed use or structure has been referred by the city council to a board or
commission to hold a public hearing on the question of adopting such
amendment. If final action by the city council is not taken on the question within
three months of the time the matter is so referred, the permit shall be issued. If
within such three month period the city council shall pass an ordinance
amending the zoning ordinance so as to prohibit such a use or structure, no
such permit shall be issued.
(2) Previously issued permits and licenses. If a
permit for any such building or structure, or a license for the conduct of any
such business or use, has been issued prior to such reference, but the business
or use has not been established, or no substantial part of the construction has
been completed at the time of such reference, such license or permit shall be
suspended and no action taken thereunder for a period of three months after
the question of amending the zoning ordinance has been so referred. If final
action by the city council is not taken on the question within three months of the
time of reference, the rights under the permit or license may be exercised. If
within such three-month period the governing body of the municipality shall pass
an ordinance prohibiting the use of building or structure on the site involved
such prohibition shall be applicable to the holder of such permit or license.
(3) Existing permitted uses as conditional uses.
When a lot is used for a purpose classified as a permitted use prior to the
effective date of this chapter, and such use is classified as a "conditional use"
by this chapter, such use shall be deemed a lawful conditional use for the
purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-59. Interference or conflict with other provisions.
It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with or abrogate, or annul any
easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, nor to interfere with, or abrogate
or annul any ordinances, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued, and not in
conflict with any provisions of this chapter, or which shall be adopted or provided, except, that
where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land, or upon the
height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces or greater lot area per family, than are
required or imposed by such easements, covenants, or agreements between parties, or by
such ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-60. Severability.
If any section or part thereof of this chapter shall be held to be unconstitutional
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to
continue in full force and effect.

Sec. 17-74. Changes or replacement of a nonconforming use.
Sec. 17-75. Expansion, relocation, restorations, repair or reconstruction.
Sec. 17-76. Exemptions allowing restorations, alterations, reconstruction and repairs.
Sec. 17-77. Termination of nonconforming uses.
Secs. 17-78—17-90. Reserved.
Sec. 17-71. Purpose.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this chapter
lots, uses and structures which were lawful before this chapter was adopted, but which would
be prohibited, restricted or regulated under the terms of this chapter or future amendments.
Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district
involved. It is the intent of this section to permit such legal nonconforming lots, uses, or
structures to continue, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter
that such nonconformities shall not be expanded, improved, nor used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-72. Registration of a nonconforming use.
In order to protect the legal nonconforming status of a nonconforming lot, use
or structure, a person who owns a nonconforming lot, use, or structure may register the
nonconformity with the community development coordinator on a form available in the office of
building and zoning.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-73. Existing nonconforming lots, uses, and structures.
Any 1) platted lot, 2) use of lot or structure, 3) location of a structure on a lot,
or 4) design of any structure, which lawfully existed on the effective date of this chapter, may
be continued even though such lot, use, location, or design does not conform to the
regulations of this chapter for the district in which it is located. However, no changes of use,
expansions or relocations of a use or structure, or restorations, alterations, and repairs of any
structure shall be made except as otherwise provided herein. There may be a change of
tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming lots, uses, or structures,
but such lots, uses, and structures shall continue to be considered nonconforming.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-74. Changes or replacement of a nonconforming use.
(a) Once changed to a conforming use, no building or land
shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use, and shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
(b) A nonconforming use or a like replacement use or
premises may continue except as provided in sections 17-75, 17-76, and 17-77
of this division. A "like replacement" shall be one which, in the determination of
the zoning administrator, is very similarly or more compatible with the
predominant conforming uses adjacent to and in the general vicinity of the
nonconforming use being altered. Any new or substitute nonconforming use not
meeting the standards as noted above shall be permitted only through the
special use permit process.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97; Ord. No. 06-10, § 2, 3-20-06; Ord. No. 12-55, § 2,

Sec. 17-75. Expansion, relocation, restorations, repair or reconstruction.
(a) N onconforming uses. No nonconforming use shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by
such use at the effective date of this chapter.
(b) N onconforming uses and structures in combination. Any
nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a nonconforming
structure in which it is located, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any
land outside such building.
(c) N onconforming structures.
(1) A nonconforming structure shall not be
extended in a way to increase the amount or degree of bulk regulation
nonconformity than was occupied at the effective date of this chapter.
Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a way which does not
increase their respective nonconformities.
(2) Should any nonconforming structure be
moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall there after
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is
moved.
(3) When a lot and/or structure
accommodating a nonconforming use is damaged or altered by fire,
explosion, wind, neglect, deterioration, acts of God, or by any other
voluntary or involuntary natural or man-made causes, to the extent of
more than 50 percent of its fair market value, it shall not be restored,
repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with the use and bulk
regulations and development standards of the zoning district in which the
lot and structure is located.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97; Ord. No. 12-55, § 3, 10-1-12; Ord. No. 13-06, § 2,
2-4-13)
Sec. 17-76. Exemptions allowing restorations, alterations, reconstruction and repairs.
A nonconforming structure may not be reconstructed or structurally altered to
an extent exceeding 50 percent of the current fair value of the building except as otherwise
provided below:
(1) Use of structure changed from nonconforming to
conforming. A nonconforming structure may be altered beyond the
limitations prescribed above if such structure houses a nonconforming use
which, by virtue of the structural alterations, is being changed to a conforming
use.
(2) Relocation or moving of a nonconforming
structure or use due to the actions or a taking by a unit of government shall be
permitted without variance to the extent that the movement or relocation is the
minimum action necessary to offset and mirror the aforementioned, applicable
governmental action.
(3) Variance granted by board of zoning appeals.
A nonconforming structure specifically designed for a nonconforming use may
be reconstructed or altered beyond the limitations provided herein in subsection
17-75(c) pursuant to the granting of a variance by the board of zoning appeals.
A variance may also be granted by the board of zoning appeals for a relocation
or movement of a nonconforming structure or use when it is due to the actions
or taking by a unit of local government and the relocation or movement exceeds
the minimum action necessary to offset such action.

2-4-13)
Sec. 17-77. Termination of nonconforming uses.
(a) A bandonment or removal. A nonconforming use shall
be deemed abandoned when it has been replaced by a conforming use or when
the nonconforming use has ceased and has not been resumed for a continuous
period of one year. The subsequent use shall conform to the regulations
specified by this chapter for this district in which such land is located. An

approval, the commission shall state the necessary conditions. If the plat
is disapproved, the commission shall express the reasons for the
disapproval. Before the commission approves a preliminary plat showing
park reservation or land for ether city use that is proposed to be

(1) Definite provision has been made for a
water supply system that is sufficient in terms of quantity, dependability,
and quality to provide an appropriate supply of water for the type of
subdivision proposed;
(2) If a public sewage system is proposed,
adequate provision has been made for such a system and, if other
methods of sewage disposal are proposed, that such systems will
comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations;
(3) All areas of the proposed subdivision
which may involve soil or topographical conditions presenting hazards or
requiring special precautions have been identified by the subdivider and
that the proposed uses of these areas are compatible with such
conditions;
(4) The subdivider has the financial ability
to complete the proposed subdivision in accordance with all applicable
federal, state, and local laws and regulations;
(5) The proposed subdivision will not result
in the scattered subdivision of land that leaves undeveloped parcels of
land lacking urban services between developed parcels;
(6) The subdivider has taken every effort
to mitigate the impact of the proposed subdivision on public health,
safety, and welfare.
The planning commission is authorized to disapprove the preliminary plat even
though the land proposed for subdivision is zoned for the use to which the proposed
subdivision will be put and the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan.
(e) E ffective period of preliminary plat approval. If a final
subdivision plat is not submitted for approval within one year from the approval
date of the preliminary plat, the applicant may be required to submit a new plat
for review subject to this development ordinance as it may hereafter be
amended.
(f) Amendments to preliminary plats. At any time after
preliminary plat approval, and before submission of a final plat, the applicant
may request of the plat officer that an amendment be made in the approval or
conditional approval of the preliminary plat. Under regulations established by the
planning commission, the plat officer may agree to proposed amendments that
are deemed to be minor. If the proposed amendment is major, the planning
commission shall hold a public meeting on the proposed major amendment in
accordance with the same requirements for preliminary plat approval found in
this section 17-183 of this chapter. Any public meeting on a proposed major
amendment shall be limited to whether the proposed major amendment should
or should not be approved. The commission shall approve or disapprove any
proposed major amendment and may make any modifications in the terms and
conditions of preliminary plat approval reasonably related to the proposed
amendment. If the applicant is unwilling to accept the proposed major
amendment under the terms and conditions required by the commission, the
applicant may withdraw the proposed major amendment. A major amendment
shall include, but is not limited to any amendment that results in or has the
effect of: 1) decreasing open space in the subdivision by ten percent or more, or
2) increasing density in the subdivision by ten percent or more. The commission
shall render a decision on the proposed major amendment within 30 days after
the meeting, including any adjourned session, was closed.

(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-185. Assurance of completion and maintenance of improvements.
(a) I mprovements and subdivision improvement agreement.
(1) Completion of improvements. Before
the final subdivision plat is signed by the plat officer, all applicants shall
be required to complete, in accordance with the planning commission's
decision and to the satisfaction of the city engineer, all the street,
sanitary and other public improvements, including lot improvements on
the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in these regulations,
specified in the final subdivision plat and as approved by the planning
commission, and to dedicate those public improvements to the city, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the dedicated property and
public improvements.
(2) Subdivision improvement agreement and
guarantee.
a. Agreement. The city council in
its sole discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval
of the final subdivision plat and, as an alternative, permit the
applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement by
which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public
improvements no later than two years following the date on which
the plat officer signs the final subdivision plat. The applicant shall
maintain each required public improvement until acceptance by
the governing body of the dedication of that completed public
improvement and also shall warrant that all required public
improvements will be free from defect for a period of two years
following the acceptance by the governing body of the dedication
of the last completed public improvement. The subdivision
improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and
conditions agreed to by the applicant and the planning
commission.
b. Covenants to run. The
subdivision improvement agreement shall provide that the
covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land and
bind all successors, heirs, and assignees of the subdivider. The
subdivision improvement agreement will be adopted by the city
council, pursuant to applicable state and local laws and shall be
recorded in the Clerk and Recorder's Office of McDonough
County.
c. Security. Whenever the city
council permits an applicant to enter into a subdivision
improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide a
letter of credit or cash escrow as security for the promises
contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. Either
security shall be in an amount equal to 120 percent of the
estimated cost of completion of the required public
improvements. The issuer of the letter of credit or the escrow
agent, as applicable, shall be acceptable to the planning
commission.
(1) Letter of credit. If the applicant posts a
letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the subdivision
improvement agreement, the credit shall (1) be irrevocable; (2) be for a
term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty
periods in section 17-185(a)(2)a.; and (3) require only that the
government present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed
by the city attorney attesting to the municipality's right to draw funds
under the credit.
(2) Cash escrow. If the applicant posts a
cash escrow as security for its promises contained in the subdivision
improvement agreement, the escrow instructions shall provide: (1) that
the subdivider will have no right to a return of any of the funds except as
provided in section 17-185(b)(2)b.; and (2) that the escrow agent shall
have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the municipality whenever the
city attorney presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the
municipality's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider
protests that right. If and when the city accepts the offer of dedication for
the last completed required public improvement, the city shall execute a
waiver of its right to receive funds represented by the letter of credit or
cash escrow if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision
improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the
subdivider's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and
its warranty that the improvements are free from defect.
(3) Temporary improvement. The applicant
shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by
the city council and shall maintain those temporary improvements for the
period specified by the council. Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the city a separate
subdivision improvement agreement and a letter of credit or cash escrow
in an appropriate amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and
credit or escrow shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly
constructed, maintained, and removed.
(4) Failure to complete improvement. For
subdivisions for which no subdivision improvement agreement has been
executed and no security has been posted, if the improvements are not
completed within the period specified by the city council in the resolution
approving the plat, the sketch plan or preliminary plat approval shall be
deemed to have expired. In those cases where a subdivision
improvement agreement has been executed and security has been
posted and required public improvements have not been installed within
the terms of the agreement, the city may then: (1) declare the agreement
to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed
regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the
agreement is declared to be in default; (2) suspend final subdivision plat
approval until the improvements are completed and record a document
to that effect for the purpose of public notice; (3) obtain funds under the
security and complete improvements itself or through a third party; (4)
assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party,
including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements
were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that
subsequent owner's promise to complete improvements in the
subdivision; (5) exercise any other rights available under the law.
(b) I nspection of improvements.
(1) General procedure and fees. Required
improvements shall be inspected during construction and ensure their
satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the municipality an
inspection fee pursuant to the fee schedule presented in chapter 24, and
where the improvements are completed prior to final plat approval, the
subdivision plat shall not be signed by the city clerk unless the inspection
fee has been paid at the time of application. Where the improvements
are not completed prior to final plat approval, no building permits or
certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the city
engineer finds upon inspection that any one or more of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
municipality's construction standards and specifications, the applicant
shall be responsible for properly completing the improvements.
(2) Release or reduction of security.
a. Certificate of satisfactory completion.
The governing body will not accept dedication of required
improvements nor release nor reduce the amount of any security
posted by the subdivider until the city engineer has submitted a
certificate stating that all required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed.
b. Reduction of security. If the
security posted by the subdivider was a cash escrow or letter of
credit, the amount of that security shall be reduced upon actual
acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then
only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which
dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public
improvements for the subdivision. Funds held in the escrow
account shall not be released to the subdivider, or letters of credit
shall not be released to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except
upon express written instructions of the city attorney.
(c) D eferral or waiver of required improvements.
(1) The city council may defer or waive at
the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision
of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in
the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which
are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or in existence of
connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of
any public improvement must be made on the record and the reasons for
the deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record.
(2) Whenever it is deemed necessary by
the city council to defer the construction of any improvement required
under these regulations because of incompatible grades, future
planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other
reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the costs of the future
improvements to the city prior to signing of the final subdivision plat by
the plat officer, or the developer may execute a separate subdivision
improvement agreement secured by a letter of credit guaranteeing
completion of the deferred improvements upon demand of the city.

(a) S ubmission and review. Subsequent to the resolution of
the planning commission, four paper copies of the subdivision plat and
construction plans, and one copy of the original of the subdivision plat on mylar
shall be submitted to the plat officer for final review. A check payable to the
county clerk and recorder in the amount of the current filing fee shall be

city council.
(d) C onditions for signing and recordation of plats.
(1) When a subdivision improvement
agreement and security are required, the chairman of the planning
commission and the community development coordinator shall endorse

been approved by the planning commission, and all the conditions of the
resolution pertaining to the final plat have been satisfied.
(2) When installation of improvements is
required prior to recordation of the final plat, the chairman of the
planning commission and community development coordinator shall

Sec. 17-201. Purpose and intent.
Planned development regulations allows for development of innovative design
by permitting some relaxation of the requirements of the underlying zone district regulations
and of the subdivision regulations. A planned development is a special use that may be
granted by the city council should it determine that the planned development is in the best
interest of the community and complies with all the standards established in this chapter.
The intent of the planned development option is to:
(1) Afford greater choice in the types of
development available to the public by allowing a development that would not
be possible under the strict application of the other requirements of this chapter;
(2) Allow for a more creative approach to the use
of land and related physical facilities that results in better development, design
and the construction of aesthetic amenities;
(3) Promote preservation of common open space
and provide more usable and suitably located recreation areas and facilities;
(4) Encourage a pattern of development to
preserve natural vegetation, topographic and geographic features; and
architectural and historic landmarks;
(5) Permit an efficient use of the land resulting in
more economic networks of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds, and
buildings, and other facilities; and
(6) To encourage the use of land which promotes
the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-202. Guidelines.
The following guidelines will be used by the planning commission and city
council to evaluate the suitability of proposed planned developments. These guidelines
represent sound planning principles which the city thinks should be incorporated into planned
developments. However, it is not intended that each and every one of these guidelines be
rigidly conformed to, provided that just cause for any departure from these guidelines is
demonstrated.
(1) The planned development should be
compatible with the character of the underlying zoning district in which it is
located.
(2) The planned development should be
consistent with the official planning policies and the comprehensive plan of the
city.
(3) The planned development should preserve the
value of the surrounding residential area.
(4) Any unusual physical, topographical or
historical features of the site of the planned development which are of
importance to the people of the area or the community should be preserved.
(5) The minimum area of a planned development
should be five acres.
(6) Yards along the periphery of a planned
development should be compatible with the yards of the adjacent properties.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-203. Exceptions from district regulations.
(a) U se exceptions. Uses not allowed in the regulations of
the underlying districts may be permitted in planned developments provided:
(1) Proposed use exceptions enhance the
quality of the planned development and are compatible with the primary
uses.
(2) Proposed use exceptions are not of a
nature, nor are located so as to create a detrimental influence on the
surrounding properties.
(3) Proposed use exceptions shall not
represent more than 40 percent of the site area or more than 40 percent
of the total floor area, whichever is less. However, in a residential
planned development area no more than ten percent of the site area or a
total floor area which ever is less, shall be devoted to commercial use,
and provided that such commercial use is integral to the nature of the
planned development.
(4) No industrial use shall be permitted.
(b) D evelopment standards exceptions. To help achieve
the intended benefits of a planned development, exceptions from the
regulations of the underlying district may be authorized, provided that:
(1) Such exceptions are solely for the
purpose of promoting a better development that will be beneficial to the
residents or occupants of the planned development as well as those of
surrounding properties.
(2) That in residential planned
developments, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed shall not
exceed by more than 40 percent of the number of dwelling units
permitted in the underlying zoning district.
(3) That the area of open space provided
in a planned development shall be at least 25 percent more than that
required in the underlying zoning district.
(4) Along the periphery of such planned
developments, yards shall be provided as required by the regulations of
the underlying zoning district.
(5) Building height shall not exceed 35 feet
except that utilization of a building existing on the site which is taller than
35 feet shall be permitted.

Sec. 17-221. Purpose.
A site plan review procedure is established to provide standards by which to
determine and control the physical layout and/or use of a lot or parcel of land. A site plan
review of all new construction required by the applicable district regulations and related site
and landscape development is required in order to further promote the safe and efficient use
of land and to further enhance the value of property in the city. The site plan review process is
intended to help ensure that newly developed properties or redeveloped properties are
compatible with adjacent development, and that safety, traffic, over-crowding and
environmental problems are minimized to the extent possible.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-222. Applicability.
Site plan review shall be required when any discretionary permit is being
requested for multiple-family residential, fraternities and sororities and commercial,
institutional, office or industrial developments. In cases involving the expansion of any existing
development as noted above, a revised site plan sufficient to address all affected or applicable
provisions of the code shall be submitted. Individual single- and two-family residential home
developments are exempt from site plan review.

Sec. 17-268. Standards for special use permits.
The planning commission and city council shall consider the following criteria
when making a determination on special use permit applications:
(1) Land use policy. The proposed use and
development will be in keeping with the land use policies established by the city
council.
(2) Ordinance purposes. The proposed use and
development will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for
which this chapter was enacted and for which the regulations of the district in
question were established.
(3) No nuisance. The proposed use and
development will not create any public nuisance by reason of noise, smoke,
odors, vibrations, objectionable lights or congestion of traffic.
(4) No undue adverse impact. The proposed use
and development will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon
adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood or area, or the public
peace, health, safety, and general welfare.
(5) No interference with surrounding development.
The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and
operated so as not to excessively interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
(6) Adequate public facilities. The proposed use
and development will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire

particular provision of this chapter authorizing such use.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-269. Conditions on special use permits.
The planning commission may impose and the city council may confirm or
impose additional conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this
chapter upon the premises benefitted by a special use permit as may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in
the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall
be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such condition
or limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of
the special use permit.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-270. Effect of issuance of a special use permit.
The granting of a special use permit authorizes the property to be used in the
manner proposed, but does not alone authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure
without first obtaining any other required permit, including a building permit.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-271. Modifications to special uses.
Any modification or intensification of a special use that alters the essential
character or operation of the use in a way not intended at the time the special use was
granted, as evidenced by the record or language of the ordinance, shall require a new special
use permit. The property owner/operator or his authorized representative shall apply for such
special use permit prior to any modification of the use or property. The community
development coordinator shall determine whether the proposed modification or intensification
represents an alteration in the essential character of the original special use as approved. The
operator of the special use shall provide the community development coordinator with all the
necessary information related to the special use to render this determination.
If the community development coordinator determines that the proposed
modification or intensification will not alter the essential character or operation of the special
use, a new special use permit shall not be required.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-272. Limitations on special use permit.
Subject to an extension of time granted by the community development
coordinator, no special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a
building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion or the approved use is commenced within that period. The
special use permit shall expire at any time the use lapses for a period in excess of 12 months.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-273. Revocation of special use permits.
A special use permit may be revoked if the established conditions for approval
are violated. The community development coordinator is responsible for advising the planning
commission of any violations, and the planning commission may then recommend to the city
council to revoke the special use permit.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-274. Effect of denial.
No application for a special use permit that has been denied by the city council
shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the order of denial, except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of condition found to be valid by the community
development coordinator.

land is improved with a condominium, notice shall be given to the condominium
association.
(3) Posting. By posting a sign in the front yard of
said property stating that a variance on said property is under consideration.
Said sign shall remain until action is taken by the board of zoning appeals
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-290. Standards for variances.
Before any variance is granted, the zoning board of appeals shall determine if
all of the following conditions are shown to be present:
(1) Because of the particular physical
surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property
involved, a particular hardship or practical difficulty to the owner would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations
were to be applied;
(2) The conditions upon which an application for a
variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought,
and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning
classification;
(3) The purpose of the variance is not based upon
a financial hardship alone;
(4) The alleged practical difficulty or undue
hardship is caused by this chapter and has not been created by any person
having an interest in the property. The granting of the variance will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements
in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and
(5) The granting of the variance will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-291. Limitations on variances.
(a) In granting a variation the board may attach thereto,
any conditions and safeguards it deems necessary or desirable in furthering the
purposes of this chapter. Violation of any of these conditions or safeguards shall
be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(b) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or
grant to the board the power or authority to permit a use not generally permitted
in the district involved.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-292. Validity of variance; time limit and extension.

Sec. 17-293. Effect of denial of variance.
No application for a variance that has been denied by the zoning board of

The community development coordinator, subject to the procedures,
standards, and limitations of this chapter, may, in writing, render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this chapter and of any rule or regulation issued pursuant
to it.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-307. Purpose.
The interpretation authority established by this chapter is intended to
recognize that the provisions of this chapter, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a
practical matter, address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many
such situations can be readily addressed by an administrative interpretation of the specific
provisions of this chapter in light of the general and specific purposes for which those
provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is an
administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the
essential content of this chapter but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that
content to specific cases.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-308. Parties entitled to seek interpretations.
Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having a right of
ownership, such as a title, lease, or purchase agreement, in property that gives rise to the
need for an interpretation; provided that interpretations shall not be sought by any person
based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect
other than as an advisory opinion. the community development coordinator may elect not to

(2) Evidence must demonstrate that the use will
comply with the district regulations established for that particular district;
(3) A use must be substantially similar to other
uses permitted in the particular district and more similar to those uses than to
uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a more restrictive district;
(4) If the proposed use is most similar to a use
permitted only as a special use in the district in which it is proposed, then any
use interpretation shall require the issuance of a Special Use permit for such
use pursuant to Article IV, Division 5, Special Use Permits; and

been issued.

vicinity of the subject property, including changes, if any, in such trend
since the subject property was placed in its present zoning classification.

uses permitted or permissible under its proposed zoning classification.

through new development to promote the logical extension of public infrastructure. The city
may require the applicant of a subdivision to extend off-site improvements to reach the
subdivision or oversize required public facilities to serve anticipated future development as a
condition of plat approval.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-426. Reservation of land for public use.
(a) Where a proposed park, playground, school or other
public use desirable for the public interest is located in whole or in part in a
subdivision, the city council may require the dedication of such area within the
subdivision in those cases in which they deem such requirements to be
reasonable. Fair and just remuneration shall be paid to the subdivider for the
land dedicated for this purpose.
(b) Where deemed essential by the city council, upon
consideration of the particular type of development proposed in the subdivision,
and especially in large-scale neighborhood unit developments, the city council
may require the reservation for the public use of such other areas or sites of a
character, extent and location suitable to the needs created by such
development for schools, parks, and other neighborhood purposes. The
subdivider shall be paid fair and just remuneration for the land used for this
purpose.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-427. Monuments.
(a) Monuments shall be placed at all block corners, angle
points, points of curves in streets; at intermediate points as shall be required by
the plat officer, and at locations approved by a registered land surveyor.
(b) The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be
monumented in the field by iron rods or pipes at least 24 inches long and one
inch in diameter.
These monuments shall be placed not more than 1,400 feet apart in any
straight line and at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes its
radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle points along the meander line, those
points to be not less than 20 feet back from the bank of any river or stream, except that when
such corners or points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be
placed in the right-of-way line of the street.
(c) All internal boundaries and those corners and points
not referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be monumented in the field by
like monuments as described above. These monuments shall be placed at all
block corners, at each end of all curves, at a point where a river changes its
radius, and at all angle points in any line.
(d) The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall
be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least 30 inches long and
seven-eighths inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 30
inches long. These monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection of the
river or stream lot line, with a meander line established not less than 20 feet
back from the bank of the river or stream.
(e) All monuments required by these regulations shall be
set flush with the ground and planted in such a manner that they will not be
removed by frost.
(f) All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and
approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time the planning
commission recommends approval of the final plat.

Sec. 17-428. Subdivision names.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of another subdivision in the area covered by these
regulations. The planning commission shall have final authority to designate the name of the
subdivision, which shall be determined at sketch plat approval.

Sec. 17-442. Lots.
Secs. 17-443—17-455. Reserved.
Sec. 17-441. Blocks.
(a) Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall
be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, waterways, or
undevelopable land.
(b) The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,320 feet.
Blocks along major arterials and collector streets shall be not less than 600 feet
in length. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width
as may be determined suitable by the planning commission for the prospective
use.
(c) In long blocks the planning commission may require the
reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities and
drainage facilities.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-442. Lots.
(a) L ot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such
that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the
zoning regulations and Illinois Department of Public Health regulations, in
providing driveway access to buildings on the lots from an approved street, or in
providing service to public sanitary sewer or approved sanitary disposal
facilities.
(b) L ot dimensions.
(1) The areas of all lots shall not be less
than the standards for the zoning district in which they are located.
(2) Where lots are more than double the
minimum required area for the zoning district, the planning commission
may require that those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision
and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to
serve potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning regulations and
these regulations.
(3) Dimensions of corner lots shall be large
enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum
front-yard setback from both streets.
(4) Depth and width of properties reserved
or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities
required for the type of use and development contemplated, as
established in the zoning regulations.
(c) L ot lines.
(1) Building setback lines shall be
established on all lots, and the minimum building set back line shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for type of
development and use contemplated, provided, however, that they shall
not be less than the standards established by the zoning regulations of
the City of Macomb.
(2) In general, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation
from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
(3) The lot line common to the street
right-of-way shall be the front line. All lots shall face the front line and a
similar line across the street. Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged
so that the rear line does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot.
(d) D ouble frontage lots and access to lots.
(1) Double frontage lots. Double frontage
and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to
provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
(2) Access from major and secondary arterials.
Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major or
secondary street. Where driveway access from a major or secondary
street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the planning
commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access
drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the street. Where
possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid
requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major and secondary arterial
(e) W aterbodies and watercourses. If a tract being
subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn
as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of
adjacent lots. The planning commission may approve an alternative plan
whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water
body is so placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No
more than 25 percent of the minimum area of a lot required under the zoning
regulations may be satisfied by land that is under water. Where a watercourse
separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which has access,
provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, of design
approved by the city engineer.
(f) Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear
or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at
least 12 feet wide, but shall be of sufficient width for the utilities planned.

Secs. 17-459—17-470. Reserved.
Sec. 17-456. Streets and roads.
(a) G eneral provisions.
(1) Frontage on improved roads required.
No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall
have access from an existing street or a street shown upon a plat
approved by the planning commission and recorded in the county
recorder of deeds' office. Such street or highway must be suitably
improved as required by this chapter, or be secured by a performance
bond required under the regulations of Article IV, Division 1,
Subdivisions.
(2) All platted roads to be improved.
Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage,
the road shall be suitably improved as provided above.
(3) Access to primary arterials.
a. Where a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the plat officer
may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non access reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
b. Where a subdivision borders
on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway
right-of-way, the plat officer may require a street approximately
parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for
park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or
industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall
also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
c. All new subdivisions along
state and county highways shall be arranged to provide access to
such highways at intervals not less than 1,320 feet, except where
impractical or impossible due to existing property divisions or
topography. Also, roads and streets within such subdivisions shall
be arranged to permit access to adjacent future subdivisions
without encroachment upon this regulation.
(4) Reserve strips. Reserve strips
controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their
control is definitely placed in the city under conditions approved by the
plat officer.
(5) Half streets. Half streets shall be
prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the
subdivision in conformity with other requirements of these regulations;
and where the plat officer finds it will be practicable to require the
dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided.
Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other
half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
(6) Continuation of streets and dead end-streets.
a. Continuation of streets (stub streets).
The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
principal streets between adjacent properties when the
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic,
effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and
where the continuation is in accordance with the comprehensive
plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must
temporarily be a deadend street, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets,
with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the
normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the
street is continued. The planning commission may limit the length
of temporary deadend streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
b. Permanent dead-end streets (culs-de-sac).
Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not required by the planning
commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall be
in a cul-de-sac turn-around having an outside roadway diameter
of at least 60 feet and a street property line diameter of at least
80 feet for curb and gutter streets 120 feet for large lot
development streets without curb and gutter. Permanent
dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) shall not be longer than 500 feet.
(b) C lassification of streets; right-of-way width and pavement widths.
(1) Minimum street right-of-way widths and
pavement widths shall be as described in Table 5.3.1.B.

(2) Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in
excess of the standards designated in these regulations shall be required
whenever due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate
earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of four-to-one. Front slopes
shall not be in excess of four-to-one, and back slopes shall not be in excess of
three-to-one.
(c) A rrangement and topography.
(1) Roads shall be related appropriately to
the topography. Local roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid
conformity of lot appearance. All streets shall be arranged so as to
obtain as many building sites as possible at, or above, the grades of the
streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be
avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design standards of
these regulations.
(2) All streets shall be properly integrated
with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated
rights-of-way as established on the official map and/or comprehensive
plan.
(3) All thoroughfares shall be properly
related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts,
schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to
the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
(4) Minor or local streets shall be laid out to
conform as much as possible to the topography to: 1) discourage use by
through traffic, 2) permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and 3)
require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient,
safe, and continuous access to property.
(5) The rigid rectangular gridiron street
pattern need not necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear
streets, culs-de-sac, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where
such use will result in a more desirable layout.
(6) Proposed streets shall be extended to
the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by
topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the
planning commission such extension is not necessary or desirable for
the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout
or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracks.
(7) In business and industrial
developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in
connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and
the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks
and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the
various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
(d) I ntersections and curves.
(1) Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall
intersect any other street at less than 70 degrees. An oblique street
should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more
than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically
approved by the planning commission.
(2) Proposed new intersections along one
side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any
existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with
centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. Where streets
intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection
of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
(3) The minimum radius at intersections
shall be as follows, except that the plat officer may require a greater
radius if deemed appropriate:
Minor street to minor street 25'
Minor street to collector street 30'
Collector street to collector
street
50'
(4) When connecting street lines deflect
from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall
be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight
distance of not less than 100 feet for minor and collector streets, and of
such greater radii as the plat officer shall determine for special cases.
(5) A tangent at least 100 feet long shall
be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
(6) Property lines at street intersections
shall be rounded with a radius of 15 feet, or of a greater radius where
the plat officer may deem it necessary. The plat officer may permit
comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners. Surface
grading at street intersections shall be such as to permit unobstructed
vision within the sight triangle formed by the center of intersection and
two points 75 feet distant, each point being on the centerline of an
intersecting street.
(e) Surfacing; cross section.
(1) Minimum pavement thickness shall be
as follows:
Collector street/road: All pavements shall be designed in accordance with the
requirements contained in the latest, revised edition of the State of Illinois DOT Design
Manual. An Illinois Bearing Ratio of 3.0 (IBR=3.0) shall be used unless the developer's
engineer submits subgrade soil tests justifying a different IBR. Before pavement construction
begins, the entire subgrade shall be tested for density in accordance with the latest edition of
the Illinois DOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction and the latest
edition of the Illinois DOT Subgrade Stability Manual. Average daily traffic volume shall be
considered when determining pavement thickness for collector streets and roads.
Local street/road: Concrete local streets and roads shall be designed in accordance
with either of the following two options:
Option 1 —6.75 inches PCC without aggregate base on a compacted subgrade;
Option 2 —6.5 inches PCC on top of 4 inches of aggregate base on a compacted
subgrade.
Asphalt local streets and roads shall be designed in accordance with the
following—Four inches of bituminous concrete surface on top of eight inches of aggregate
base course on compacted subgrade.
An Illinois Bearing Ratio of 3.0 (IBR=3.0) shall be used for the subgrade under both
concrete and asphalt local streets and roads unless the developer's engineer submits
subgrade soil tests justifying a different IBR. Before pavement construction begins, the entire
subgrade shall be tested for density in accordance with the latest edition of the Illinois DOT
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction and the latest edition of the Illinois
DOT Subgrade Stability Manual.
(2) No street grade shall be less than 0.35
percent for concrete and 0.50 percent for asphalt.
(3) Except for large lot residential
developments, concrete curb and gutter shall be provided.
a. Minimum surface grades shall
be as follows:
Curb and gutter 0.35%
Paved ditches 0.10%
Earth ditches 0.75%
b. Shoulders and side slopes of
ditches where curb and gutter are not required shall be as
follows:
Shoulder Turf at least four feet wide
for minor streets and eight feet wide for
collector streets
Ditch backslope Maximum slope of 3:1
Ditch foreslope Maximum slope of 4:1
Bottom Flat, minimum two feet wide
In addition, erosion control shall be provided as directed by the city engineer.
(f) Street names; street signs; and street lights.
(1) No street names shall be used which
will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street
names shall be subject to the approval of the plat officer.
(2) Street name signs shall be located at
all intersections, conforming to standard for the city.
(3) The street numbering system for any
property shall be subject to the approval of the city clerk.
(4) Street lighting conforming to the
standards adopted by the City of Macomb shall be installed at
street/road intersections and at intervals of no more than 450 feet apart.

Sec. 17-458. Sidewalks.
(a) R equired. Sidewalks bike/recreational paths shall be
installed on lots as they are developed and all sidewalks or paths in a
subdivision or planned unit development (PUD) shall be completed by the time
75 percent of the lots provided for in the plat are improved, but in no event shall
sidewalks not be installed within three years of the date of plat or PUD approval
by the city council.
(b) M odification by council. The city council may, by simple
majority vote, choose to accept an alternative arrangement for installation of
sidewalks in lieu of the requirement specifically stated under item (a) above. Any
such alternative arrangement shall result in a benefit approximately equal in
size, nature, cost and community enhancement as the aforementioned
requirements under item (a) of this section.
(c) L ocation.
(1) Publicly maintained sidewalks and bike
or recreational paths shall be constructed and included within a
dedicated public right-of-way area.
(2) New sidewalks shall be located so that
a parkway of not less than four feet separates the sidewalk from the curb
and gutter.
(d) D imensions, improvement standards.
(1) New sidewalks shall have a required
width of four feet along minor streets in single-family areas, five feet
along minor streets in multifamily areas, five feet along business
collector streets, and five feet along residential collector streets.
(2) Concrete curbs are required for all new
streets where new sidewalks are required by these regulations.
(3) Improvement standards for new
bike/recreational paths as required by the city's adopted bike plan will be
determined by the specific type of path being required and the current
applicable IDOT construction standards for same.
(4) New sidewalks shall be monolithic
concrete four inches in thickness in location and with pitch and surfaces
of one-fourth inch per one foot towards the curb. Replacement sidewalk
sections shall also be four inches in thickness.
(5) The interconnection and location of all
sidewalks and/or bike/recreational paths shall be reviewed and/or
approved by the planning commission, city council, community
development coordinator and director of public works as applicable.
(6) Ramps associated with new or
replacement sidewalks shall be provided at all intersections for
accessibility by the mobility-impaired.
(7) Sidewalks shall be the same thickness
at driveways as the thickness of the driveway pavement.
(e) P edestrian access. The planning commission may
require, in order to facilitate pedestrian or bicycle access from streets or roads
to schools, parks, playgrounds, bike/recreational paths or other nearby streets
or roads, perpetual unobstructed easements of up to 20 feet in width.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat or site plan.
(f) Repair and replacement of sidewalks. In the case of any
redevelopment project requiring a subdivision plat or site plan, the director of
public works shall, utilizing a written set of criteria, determine if any existing
sidewalks abutting the development are deteriorated to the point of being in
need of repair or replacement. Any segment of sidewalk determined to be in a
substandard condition shall be repaired or replaced to the point of full
restoration, including compliance with ADA standards.

Sec. 17-471. Purpose.
These stormwater drainage regulations are intended to manage and control
runoff. Stormwater shall be managed by the best and most appropriate technology and
environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques, which may include combined
detention facilities, piping and swales, as well as traditional retention and detention facilities
and storm sewers. The following criteria shall be used in designing and evaluating the
drainage system.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-472. General requirements.
(a) The city council, planning commission and/or city staff
shall not recommend for approval any preliminary or final plat of any subdivision
or approve any site plan for any multiple-family residential, commercial,
institutional or industrial development exceeding the thresholds as outlined
below that does not make adequate provision for storm and flood water runoff.
Adequate provision shall be determined by a formal storm water detention study
conducted by a licensed professional engineer. The applicant may also be
required by the planning commission, city council or city staff to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously
to, or as a result of the development.
(b) The following development situations shall require the
preparation of a complete storm water detention study certified by a licensed
professional engineer:
(1) Any development that covers more
than 17.5 percent of the total gross lot(s) area (lot coverage ratio or LCR)
with impervious surface.
(2) Any development that, in aggregate,
results in over 17,500 square feet of impervious area, regardless of LCR.
(3) Any subdivision of either more than
four lots, or with a LCR greater than 17.5 percent or a total impervious
area of more than 17,500 square feet.
Note: Single and two-family homes on single lots, (not part of a subdivision) and lots
less than 5,000 sq. ft. in size or within the downtown area bounded by Calhoun, Jefferson,
Campbell and McArthur Streets are exempted from the provisions of subsection (b) of this
section.
(c) The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and
independent of any sanitary sewer system.
(d) Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road
right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width. Such easements shall be in accordance with the construction
standards and specifications. The drainage system of a property shall be
designed to control the peak discharge from the property for the ten-year storm
of critical duration and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels that will not create an
increase in flooding downstream when considered in aggregate with other
developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. Detention facilities
shall be constructed so that the rate of release of storm water shall not exceed
either the storm water runoff rate from the property in its existing state or the
pro-rated capacity of existing downstream storm sewers, whichever is less.
Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter.
(e) Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for
each and every lot and block.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97; Ord. No. 2765, § 1, 7-7-98; Ord. No. 2911, § 1,

Sec. 17-473. Required public storm sewers.
(a) A ccessibility to public storm sewers.
(1) Where a public storm sewer is
accessible, the applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no
outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be
made for the disposal of stormwaters, subject to the specifications of the
city engineer. However, in subdivision or developments containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial
districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivision or developments and be conducted to an
approved outfall. Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the city
engineer.
(2) If a connection to a public storm sewer
will be provided eventually, as determined by the city engineer and the
planning commission, the developer shall make arrangements for future
stormwater disposal by a public utility system at the time the plat
receives final approval. The developer shall also be responsible for
connecting each sump pump within the development to the storm sewer
system. Provision for such connections shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the subdivision or development improvement agreement
required for the subdivision or development plat.
(b) D esign of public storm sewers. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as
approved by the planning commission, and shall convey the 10-year critical
duration storm to the detention areas with the release rate as specified. A copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. When calculations
indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall
be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at
that point.

(a) G eneral. Detention basins shall be designed to remove
stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as
feasible, to be used for recreational purposes. Storage to be provided in a
detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour flood
event. Detention storage shall be calculated using an approved hydrograph
method, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with plans.
Inlet and outlet locations should be placed as far apart as is practical. In
designing outlets, the applicant shall consider the impact of downstream areas
on the capacity of the basin. Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated
into the design to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets. These could include
decorative stone or wetland-type plant materials.
(b) W et basin design. The use of wet basins for stormwater
detention shall be subject to approval of the planning commission and city
council. If approved, wet basins shall be at least three feet deep. The side
slopes of wet basins at normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than
five-to-one (horizontal to vertical). The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to or greater than the runoff volume from its
watershed for the two year event. In addition, each wet basin shall be enclosed
by a six-foot high chainlink fence.
(c) D ry basin design. Dry basins shall be designed so that
80 percent of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72
hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Where a single pipe is
used for discharge, it shall be a minimum of four inches in diameter. If this
conflicts with release requirements above, a self-cleaning flow restrictor shall be
utilized.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-475. Other considerations.
(a) A ccommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert
or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or
outside the subdivision or development. The city engineer shall determine the
necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential
watershed development permitted by the zoning regulations.
(b) E ffect on downstream drainage areas. The city engineer
shall also study the effect of each subdivision or development on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision or
development. Local government drainage studies together with such other
studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements.
Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of
the subdivision or development will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility, the planning commission may withhold approval of the subdivision or
development until provision has been made for the expansion of the existing
downstream drainage facility. No subdivision or development shall be approved
unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage
watercourse or facility.
(c) A reas of poor drainage. Plats submitted containing
areas subject to poor drainage, but located outside the 100-year floodplain, may
be approved by the planning commission subject to performance of any
remedial measures determined by the city engineer to be appropriate and
necessary to alleviate such drainage conditions.
The plat of the subdivision or development shall provide for an overflow zone
along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width that shall be sufficient in times of high
water to contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall
any structure be erected or placed in the overflow zone. The boundaries of the overflow zone
shall be subject to approval by the city engineer. The planning commission may deny
subdivision or development approval for areas of extremely poor drainage.
The lowest building floor elevations should be at least two feet above any
potential flood level as determined by the city engineer.
(d) F loodplain areas. The planning commission may, when
it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision or development of any portion of
the property that lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course.
These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or
damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or
stumps, except at the discretion of the planning commission.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-476. Dedication of drainage easements.
(a) G eneral requirements. When a subdivision or
development is traversed by a 100-year floodplain or any other watercourse,
drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such
floodplain or watercourse, and of such width and construction as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width
for maximum potential volume of flow.
(b) D rainage easements.
(1) Where topography or other conditions
make the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way
impractical, perpetual, unobstructed casements at least 15 feet in width
for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road
lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be
indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall extend from the road to
a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. Where a drainage
easement is not located in the public right-of-way, it shall be owned and
maintained by the lot property owner, or where applicable, a
homeowner's association.
(2) When a proposed drainage system will
carry water across private land outside the subdivision or development,
appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat.
(3) The applicant shall dedicate, either in
fee or by a drainage or conservation easement, land on both sides of
existing watercourses to a distance to be determined by the planning
commission.
(4) Low-lying lands along watercourses
subject to flooding or overflowing during storm periods, whether or not
included in areas for dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their
natural state as drainage ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic
flooding shall not be computed in determining the number of lots to be
utilized for average density procedures nor for computing the area
requirement of any lot.

to be retained shall be preserved and protected against change of grade and construction
damage. The site plan shall show the location of all desirable trees with diameters of 12 inches
or greater. when it is determined by the city that removal of a tree designated for protection is
needed to avoid or alleviate an economic or other hardship on the developer, the city may
issue a tree removal permit. The developer shall replace protected trees for which removal
permits have been granted with new trees, the total aggregate caliper of all such trees used as
replacements shall be equal to or exceed one-third the diameter of the protected trees so
removed. In the event that the city determines full replacement would result in unreasonable
crowding of trees on the lot, the city may approve alternate locations within the development or

Sec. 17-852. Programs and incentives to reduce parking requirements.
The following programs and incentives are provided to permit reduced parking
requirements in the locations and situations outlined herein where the basic parking
requirements of this code would be excessive or detrimental to goals and policies of the city
relating to traffic congestion and environmental protection.
(1) Mixed-use shared parking programs.
a. Purpose. The city recognizes that strict
application of the required parking ratios may result in the provision of
excessive numbers of parking spaces and, therefore, excessive
pavement and impermeable surfaces. A mixed-use shared parking
program provides an option to reduce the total required parking in large
mixed-use facilities in which the uses operate at different times from one
another throughout the day.
b. Applicability. The mixed-use shared
parking program may be applied where mixed-uses are proposed.
c. Procedure.
1. The community development
coordinator may authorize a reduction in the total number of
required parking spaces pursuant to Table 7.1.2, Schedule of
Shared Parking Calculations, if the respective hours of operation
of the uses do not overlap.

How to use the Schedule of Shared Parking
Calculate the number of spaces required for each use if it were freestanding (refer to
the schedule of minimum on-site parking requirements). Applying the applicable general land
use category to each proposed use, use the percentages to calculate the number of spaces
required for each time period, (six time periods per use). Add the number of spaces required
for all applicable land uses to obtain a total parking requirement for each time period. Select
the time period with the highest total parking requirement and use that total as your shared
parking requirement.
2. The total number of parking spaces required
per Table 7.1.1, Schedule of Parking Requirements, shall not be reduced by
more than 20 percent.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-853. Parking spaces accessible to the disabled.

the public to provide facilities which are accessible to people with disabilities as defined by the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. In accordance with this goal and pursuant to the
ADA, accessible parking shall be provided by any building or use initiated after the effective
date of this Code according to the following minimum requirements and any further
requirements hereafter adopted by federal, state, or local law.
(1) Required spaces. Accessible parking spaces
shall be provided at a rate of four percent of total required parking spaces. Van
accessible parking spaces shall be provided in the amount set forth by Table
7.1.3. In addition to these requirements, accessible patient parking at outpatient
facilities must equal no less than ten percent of the required parking, and
facilities which specialize in treatment or services for persons with mobility
impairments must provide accessible parking equaling no less than 20 percent
of the required parking for patient use.

a. Access aisles. Access aisles shall be
no less than five feet in width when adjacent to an automobile accessible
space and no less than eight feet in width when adjacent to a van
accessible space. At the entrance to each access aisle which is eight
feet or wider, two bollards shall be placed at the outside corners of the
aisle so as to prevent vehicles from parking in the aisle illegally. No
access aisles shall be obstructed by any curb ramp or wheel stop.
b. Accessible routes. Each automobile
accessible or van accessible parking space shall be located along an
accessible route to the building entrance. The minimum width of said
accessible route shall be three feet.
c. Maximum slope. Accessible parking
spaces, access aisles, and accessible routes shall not exceed a slope of
1:50, and the ramp from the access aisle to the sidewalk or other
transition to the principal use shall not exceed a slope of 1:12.
d. Vertical clearance. The vertical
clearance for accessible parking spaces shall be no less than eight feet
two inches, and the vertical clearance for passenger loading zones shall
be no less than nine feet six inches.

permitted by right within the applicable district have been reasonably exhausted
and when the site granted such special use permit will be markedly improved
over its present condition (i.e.) infill development of a vacant lot or the
improvement or removal of deteriorated or dilapidated structures or
inappropriate uses. An application for a special use will be possible only when
all of the conditions listed below can also be met:
(1) Parking pad areas are permitted only in
the case of one- and two-family dwelling unit structures.
(2) Parking pad areas are permitted only
within R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3A and R-4 Residential Zoning Districts.

Sec. 17-871. Purpose.
These landscaping requirements are intended to foster aesthetically pleasing
development which will preserve and enhance the appearance, character, health, safety, and
welfare of the community. These regulations are intended to increase the compatibility of
adjacent uses, and, in doing so, minimize the harmful impact of noise, dust and other debris,
motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities
or impacts conducted or created by an adjoining or nearby uses. These regulations are also
intended to promote the prudent use of water and energy resources.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-872. Enforcement of landscaping requirements.
The landscaping provisions of this code shall be enforced for all new
construction requiring a landscape plan. Wherever the submission and approval of a
landscape plan is required by this Code, such landscape plan shall be an integral part of any
application for a building permit and occupancy permit. No permit shall be issued without city
approval of a landscape plan as required herein. Failure to implement the approved landscape
plan shall be cause for revocation of the occupancy permit.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-873. Landscape plan.
(a) L andscape plan required. A landscape plan shall be
required for the following situations:

walls proposed for location on the site.
(6) Diagrams and maps shall be drawn
using a scale of one inch to 50 feet.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-874. Selection, installation, and maintenance of plant materials.
(a) S election. Planting materials used in conformance with
the provisions of this section shall be of good quality, of a species hardy to
western Illinois, and capable of withstanding the extremes of individual site
microclimates. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting
and at maturity, are additional criteria which shall be considered when selecting
plant materials. The use of drought tolerant plant material is preferred. The use
of salt tolerant plant material is preferred for landscaping near streets and other
rights-of-way.
(b) I nstallation. All landscaping materials shall be installed
in accordance with the current planting procedures established by the American
Association of Nurserymen. The installation of all plant material required by this
chapter may be delayed until the next optimal planting season, as determined
by the community development coordinator.
(c) M aintenance. The owner of the premises shall be
responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all failed
landscaping materials and structures. All landscaping materials shall be

necessary and shall be kept free of refuse and debris. Fences, walls, and other
barriers shall be maintained in good repair. Irrigation systems if needed shall be
maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
materials and the conservation of water.
(Ord. No. 2750, § 2, 11-17-97)
Sec. 17-875. Design standards and guidelines.
Landscape plans described above shall be prepared based on the following
design standards and guidelines. Standards are numerically measurable and can be
definitively evaluated for compliance. Design guidelines are not precisely measurable, but
compliance can be determined through the evaluation process of landscape plan review.
(1) Minimum standards.
a. Shade trees. All shade trees shall
have a minimum trunk size of one and one-half inches in caliper, unless
otherwise specified. The removal of trees within the public right-of-way is
prohibited without the approval of the community development
coordinator.
b. Shrubs. All shrubs shall have minimum
height of 18 inches at planting and a maximum height of six feet at
maturity, except for parkway shrubs, which shall have no minimum
height at planting and which shall have a maximum height of 18 inches
at maturity.
c. Yards. Yards shall be landscaped
primarily with turf or other plant materials. Pavement of yards other than
for parking or loading purposes is prohibited.
(2) Design guidelines.
a. Scale and nature of landscaping material.
The scale and nature of landscaping materials shall be appropriate to
the size of the structures. Large scaled buildings, for example, should
generally be complemented by larger scaled plants.
b. Selection of plant material. Plant
material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth
and adaptability to local conditions.
c. Evergreens. Evergreens should be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site, particularly in those
areas where screening and buffer is required.
d. Softening of walls and fences. Plant
material should be placed intermittently against long expanses of
building walls, fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect.
e. Planting beds. Planting beds should
be mulched with bark chips, feather rocks, or similar materials. Mulch
shall not be used as a substitute for plant materials.
f. D etention/retention basins and ponds.
Detention/retention basins and ponds shall be landscaped. Such
landscaping should include shade and ornamental trees, evergreens,
shrubbery, hedges, turf, groundcover and/or other plant materials.
g. Water conservation. Landscape
design pursuant to the requirements of this chapter must recognize the
need for water conservation. While sprinkler irrigation systems are
required for certain landscape areas, and may be desirable for other
applications, all irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize the use
of water.
h. Domestic turf grasses. Domestic turf
grasses should be used in areas with little or no slope to prevent the
runoff of irrigation water.
i. E nergy conservation. Plant material
placement will be designed to reduce the energy consumption needs of
the development.
1. Deciduous trees should be
placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade
from the summer sun.
2. Evergreens and other plant
materials should be concentrated on the north and west sides of
buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
j. P reservation of existing plant material.
Existing plant material should be incorporated into the landscape
treatment of a site. Effort should be made to preserve and protect
existing trees with trunk diameters in excess of 12 inches. Construction
equipment and personnel should be kept away from such trees and their
root systems by the installation of fencing materials at the tree's dripline.
k. Berming. Earthen berms and existing
topographic features should be incorporated into the landscape
treatment of a site whenever determined practical by the community
development coordinator, particularly when combined with plant material
to facilitate screening.

applicable regulations of this section are met, a property owner may advertise
for a second business at the site of the first business and visa versa. All signs
shall be located pursuant to the following:
(1) No sign, whether temporary or

b. In no case shall the lighting
intensity of any sign, whether resulting from internal or external
illumination, exceed 60 foot-candles when measured with a
standard light meter perpendicular to the face of the sign at a
distance equal to the narrowest dimension of the sign.
c. Signs may have electronic
areas that display: drawings, streaming video; symbols or logo;
scrolling text messages; shrinking or enlarging lettering; changing
shapes and figures; recreated photographs; or flash at

Any graphically enhanced (LED display) electronic signs as
described above shall be limited to a maximum height of 24 feet
and the graphic display surface shall cover no more than 36
square feet in area. LED display signs as outlined above shall be
permitted in AG, O/I, B-1, B-2, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. LED
display signs located within the Downtown District, Adams Street
Mixed Use District or within any local, state or national historic
district regardless of zoning designation shall be limited to a
maximum size of eight square feet in graphic display surface
area. These signs shall also be limited to portraying only symbols,

(a) R educed lot area. No lot shall be so reduced in area
that any required open space will be smaller than prescribed in the regulations
for the district in which said lot is located. Whenever such reduction in lot area
occurs, any building located on said lot shall not thereafter be used until such

yard requirements applicable thereto.
(b) D wellings on small lots. Notwithstanding the limitations
imposed by any other provisions of this chapter a dwelling may be erected on
any lot of record or separately owned or under contract of sale and containing,
at the time of the passage of this Code, an area or a width smaller than that
required for a one-family dwelling.
(c) V isibility at intersections. On a corner in any residence
district no fence, wall, hedge, earth terraces, parking facilities or other structure
or plant which would obstruct motor vehicle visibility of traffic approaching the
corner or intersection, shall be erected, placed or maintained within the
triangular area formed by the intersecting lot lines nearest the street

unless a solid fence is required by another section of this Code. Such
fence may be up to eight feet in height.
(h) F encing aesthetics. The decorative side of fencing shall

rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall, as closely as
possible, match the old in design, color, texture, materials and other
visual qualities. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated
by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence whenever it is available.
(7) Chemical or physical treatments, such as
sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.
The surface cleaning of the structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
(8) Significant archaeological resources affected by
a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related
new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
(10) New additions and adjacent or related
new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and
its environment would be unimpaired.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-927. Design guidelines.
(a) Design guidelines for applying the criteria for review of
certificates of appropriateness shall at a minimum, consider the following
architectural criteria:
(1) Height. The height of any proposed alteration or
construction should be compatible with the style and character of the
landmark and with surrounding structures in a historic district.
(2) Proportions of windows and doors. The
proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark.
(3) Relationship of building masses and spaces.
The relationship of a structure within a historic district to the open space
between it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
(4) Roof shape. The design of the roof, fascia, and
cornice should be compatible with the architectural style and character of
the landmark.
(5) Landscaping. Landscaping should be
compatible with the architectural character and appearance of the
landmark.
(6) Scale. The scale of the structure after alteration,
construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its
architectural style and character and with surrounding structures in a
historic district.
(7) Directional expression. Facades in historic
districts should blend with other structures with regard to directional
expression. Structures in a historic district should be compatible with the
dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures.
(8) The direction expression of a landmark after
alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with
its original architectural style and character.
(9) Architectural details. Architectural details
including types of materials, colors, and textures should be treated so as
to make landmark compatible with its original architectural style and
character of a landmark or historic district.
(10) New structures in a historic district shall
be compatible with the architectural styles and design in said districts.
(11) (i) Any new or replacement canopies or
awnings shall be of an all-weather cloth or canvas material and shall be
of a subtle, pastel or earth-tone color; or
(ii) Any new or replacement canopies or awnings may be metal and shall be of a
subtle, pastel or earth-tone color and are to be approved on a case by case basis as the
applicants submit a COA application.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 17-25, § 2, 10-16-17)
Sec. 17-928. Hearing on COA applications.
(a) Applications for a certificate of appropriateness are
available from the office of building and zoning. Such applications shall be
completed and submitted to the office of building and zoning which shall be
forwarded to the Macomb Historic Preservation Commission.
(b) The commission shall schedule a public meeting for
consideration of the application within 15 days of receipt of application and hold
such hearing within 30 days of such receipt. A public notice for consideration of
the application shall be made not less than ten days nor more than 20 days
before hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Macomb.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-929. Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
(a) The Macomb Historic Preservation Commission shall
notify the applicants of their decision within five days after the public meeting.
Upon approval of the application, the commission shall direct the office of
building and zoning to issue signed COA to the applicant with copies forwarded
to the building inspector.
(b) A COA shall be invalid if substantial changes in the
plans reviewed by the commission are necessary in obtaining a building permit
or if the building permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The
certificate of appropriateness remains valid for the same period of validity as the
building permit (six months).
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-930. Denial of a certificate of appropriateness.
(a) In the event of denial of an application for a COA, the
commission shall notify the applicant in writing of the disapproval and the
reasons therefore and shall recommend changes, if any, in the proposed action
that would cause the commission to reconsider its denial.
(b) Within 15 days of receipt of the notification of
disapproval, the applicant may resubmit an amended application for a COA that
takes into consideration the recommendations of the historic preservation
commission.
(c) The application shall be considered to be withdrawn if no
written modification within the 15-day period as noted above is received. Within
30 days of receipt of a written modified COA, the commission must either issue
the COA or reaffirm the denial.
(d) The process for the resubmission of a modified COA is
as follows:
(1) The Macomb Historic Preservation Commission
shall select a reasonable time and place for consideration of the appeal
and give due notice thereof to the applicant by mailing notice of the
hearing. Said mailing is to be made at least ten days prior to the date of
the hearing.
(2) The chairperson shall conduct the meeting and
the Macomb Historic Preservation Commission and the applicant shall
have the right to introduce evidence and cross examine witnesses. A
recorded or written transcript of the hearing shall be made and kept.
(3) The commission shall vote, announce its
decision, make its recommendation, and notify the office of building and
zoning and the applicant either at or within five days after the conclusion
of the meeting, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement
between the commission and the applicant.
(4) In the event of a denial of appeal by the
Macomb Preservation Commission, the applicant may appeal the
decision of the city council, whose decision in this matter shall be final
subject only to judicial review as provided by law.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-931. Certificate of economic hardship.
(a) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the ordinance
to the contrary, the commission may issue a certificate of economic hardship to
allow the performance of work for which a certificate of appropriateness has
been denied.
(b) Applicants claiming economic hardship shall be required
to determine eligibility for rehabilitation assistance. The eligibility for and
availability of financial aid shall be considered by the commission in making its
decision.
(c) An applicant for a certificate of economic hardship may
submit any or all of the following information in order to assist the commission in
making its determination on the application:
(1) The amount paid for the property, the date of
purchase and the party from whom purchased.
(2) The total estimated amount of investment in the
subject project.
(3) The estimated amount of increased cost
attributable to the owner/developer to be in compliance with the
standards as established by the commission.
(4) The assessed value of the land and
improvements thereon according to the two most recent assessments.
(5) Real estate taxes for the previous two years.
(6) Remaining balance on mortgage, if any, and
annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years.
(7) Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price
asked and offers received, if any.
(8) If the property is income-producing, the annual
gross income from the property for the previous two years, itemized
operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years, and
annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any during the same
period.
(9) Any other information reasonably necessary for
a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or
yield a reasonable return to present or future owners.
(10) If the commission shall make a decision
within 20 days of submittal of the request. If the commission finds that
without approval of the proposed work, the property owner cannot obtain
a reasonable economic return therefrom, the commission shall make
recommendations to the city council to allow for a reasonably beneficial
use or a reasonable economic return of the subject property through a
relaxation of the provisions of the ordinance.
(d) If the city council finds that without approval of the
proposed work, the property cannot be put to a reasonable beneficial use or the
owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom, then the council
shall issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work with
reduced or waived regulations. If the council finds otherwise, it shall deny the
application for a certificate of economic hardship. A council decision shall be
rendered within 20 days of receipt of a recommendation from the historic
preservation commission.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-932. Appeals.
When a certificate of appropriateness or economic hardship is denied for either
a landmark or a structure within a historic district, the applicant or any interested party may,
within 30 days, appeal the commission's decision to the city council. The council may receive
comments on the contents of the record but no new matter may be considered by the council.
The city council may affirm or reverse the decision or recommend changes by a majority vote
of the council after due consideration of the facts contained in the record submitted to the
council by the commission. The council may overturn the commission's decision by a majority
vote of a quorum of the council. Council action shall be taken within 20 days of receipt of the
appeal.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-933. Natural destruction or demolition.
(a) In the case of partial or complete natural destruction or
demolition of a site within a historic preservation district or of a landmark, the
owner will be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the
commission prior to reconstruction. Although exact duplication of the previous
structure may not be required, the exterior design of the property shall be in
harmony with:
(1) The exterior design of the structure prior to
damage, and
(2) The character of the historic preservation
district.
(Ord. No. 08-43, § 2, 9-2-08)
Sec. 17-934. Fees and penalties.
The preservation commission may establish an appropriate system of
processing fees for the review of nominations and COAs. Any person who undertakes or
causes an alteration, construction, demolition, or removal of any nominated or designated
landmark or property within a nominated or designated landmark or designated historic district
without a COA shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished
by a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00. Every day such violation shall
continue to exist shall constitute a separate violation.

applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
director of public works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application
does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws,
rules, and regulations, the director of public works shall reject such application
in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the director of public works is satisfied
that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this article and
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the director of public
works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it
shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
director of public works, that the construction proposed under the application
shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this article.
(b) A dditional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
(1) Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone
Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify
the city that it intends to commence work governed by this article for
facilities for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice
shall consist of plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient
to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be
provided by the telecommunications retailer to the city not less than ten
days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not
less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work requiring
excavation. The director of public works shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
constructed.
(2) In the event that the director of public works
fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications
retailer within either (i) ten days after service of notice to the city by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation
for new construction or (ii) 25 days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for

after submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by the city, provided
the holder has complied with applicable city codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. No. 10-37, § 2, 10-4-10)
Sec. 20-262. Effect of permit.
(a) A uthority granted; no property right or other interest created.
A permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities
in accordance with this article on city rights-of-way, and does not create a
property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of
others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
(b) D uration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be
valid for a period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
(c) P re-construction meeting required. If required by the city,
no construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior
to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors
who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The
pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by
the city with such city representatives in attendance as the city deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under
the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where
work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and
egress by adjacent property owners.
(d) C ompliance with all laws required. The issuance of a
permit by the city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations.
(Ord. No. 10-37, § 2, 10-4-10)
Sec. 20-263. Revised permit drawings.

respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with
the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city
within 90 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations
approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of
this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 20-277 of
this article. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove
the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and
submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. No. 10-37, § 2, 10-4-10)
Sec. 20-264. Insurance.
(a) R equired coverages and limits. Unless otherwise
provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and
maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named
insured and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
(1) Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard
(commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and
products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:
(i) Five million dollars for bodily
injury or death to each person;
ii) Five million dollars for property
damage resulting from any one accident; and
iii) Five million dollars for all other

injury and property damage for each accident;
(3) Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
(4) Employer's liability insurance with limits of not
less than $1,000,000.00 per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply
with this section.
(b) E xcess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by
this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella
policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over
underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered
by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or
umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
(c) C opies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of
the policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
(d) M aintenance and renewal of required coverages. The
insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following
endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by registered mail
or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the City
Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew."
Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than ten
days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of
replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
(e) S elf-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and
(d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the
Workers Compensation Act.
(f) Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability.
The legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the matters
that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this
section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the
recovery of any amounts thereunder.
(g) I nsurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to
this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
[All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and
of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.]
(Ord. No. 10-37, § 2, 10-4-10)
Sec. 20-265. Indemnification.
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and appointed officials

injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out
of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or
misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided,
however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
negligence, misconduct or breach of this article by the city, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives.
(Ord. No. 10-37, § 2, 10-4-10)
Sec. 20-266. Security.
(a) P urpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in
a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
(1) The faithful performance by the permittee of all
the requirements of this article;
(2) Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by
the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes,
rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued
pursuant to this article; and
(3) The payment by permittee of all liens and all
damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this
article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or
restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that
the city must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely
of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments
due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other
applicable law.
(b) F orm. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the
city in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to
the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
(1) Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the city and the permittee;
(2) Not require the consent of the permittee prior to
the collection by the city of any amounts covered by it; and
(3) Shall provide a location convenient to the city
and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
(c) A mount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way
to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred
if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in
one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another
phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the
previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of
sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which
shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
subsection (c) for any single phase.
(d) W ithdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within
the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
(1) Fails to make any payment required to be made
by the permittee hereunder;
(2) Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities
that are due and unpaid;
(3) Fails to reimburse the city for any damages,
claims, costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or
incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or
(4) Fails to comply with any provision of this article
that the city determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an
amount in the security fund.
(e) R eplenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (c) of this section.
(f) Interest. The permittee may request that any and all
interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee
by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any
such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection (c) of this section.
(g) C losing and return of security fund. Upon completion of
the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within
a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or
other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security
fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the
city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage
incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in
excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
(h) R ights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with
respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any
other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated.

following regulations, in addition to the regulations, restrictions and processes
contained in this article:
(1) N umber limitation and co-location. The city staff
as designated may regulate the number of personal wireless
telecommunications facilities allowed on each utility pole or unit of
city-owned infrastructure. No more than two personal wireless
telecommunications facilities will be permitted on utility poles or
alternative antenna structure of 90 feet or less. No more than three
personal wireless telecommunications facilities will be permitted on utility
poles or alternative antenna structures in excess of 90 feet and less than
120 feet. This section does not preclude or prohibit co-location of
personal wireless telecommunication facilities on towers or monopoles
that meet the requirements as set forth elsewhere in this section or as
required by federal law.
(2) S eparation and clearance requirements.
Personal wireless telecommunication facilities may be attached to a
utility pole, alternative antenna structure, monopole, or city-owned
infrastructure only where such pole, structure or infrastructure is located
no closer than a distance equal to 100 percent of the height of such
facility to any residential building and no closer than 300 feet from any
other personal wireless telecommunication facility. A separation or lesser
clearance may be allowed by the city administrator or their designee as
an administrative variance to this section when the applicant establishes
that the lesser separation or clearance is necessary to close a significant
coverage or capacity gap in the applicant's services or to otherwise
provide adequate services to customers, and the proposed antenna or
facility is the least intrusive means to do so within the right-of-way.
(3) C ity-owned infrastructure. Personal wireless
telecommunication facilities can only be mounted to city-owned
infrastructure including, but not limited to, streetlights, traffic signal,
towers or buildings, if authorized by a license or other agreement
between the owner and the city.
(4) N ew towers. No new monopole or other tower to
support personal wireless telecommunication facilities in excess of 40
feet is permitted to be installed on right-of-way within the jurisdiction of
the city unless an increased height limit may be allowed by the city
administrator or their designee as an administrative variance to this
section when the applicant establishes that the increased height is
necessary to close a significant coverage or capacity gap in the
applicant's services or to otherwise provide adequate services to
customers, and the proposed antenna or facility is the least intrusive
means to do so within the right-of-way.
(5) A ttachment limitations. No personal wireless
telecommunication antenna or facility within the right-of-way will be
attached to a utility pole, alternative antenna structure, tower, or
city-owned infrastructure unless all of the following conditions are
satisfied:
a. Surface area of antenna: The
personal wireless telecommunication antenna, including antenna
panels, whip antennas or dish-shaped antennas, cannot have a
surface area of more than seven cubic feet in volume.

than eight feet above grade.
d. Personal wireless telecommunication
services equipment mounted at grade: In the event
that the operator of a personal wireless telecommunication facility
proposes to install a facility where equipment or appurtenances
are to be installed at grade, screening must be installed to
minimize the visibility of the facility. Screening must be installed
at least three feet from the equipment installed at-grade and eight
feet from a roadway.
e. Height: The top of the highest
point of the antenna cannot extend more than seven feet above
the highest point of the utility pole, alternative antenna support
structure, tower or city-owned infrastructure. If necessary, the
replacement or new utility pole, alternative support structure or
city-owned infrastructure located within the public right-of-way
may be no more than 40 feet. A replacement structure may
exceed 40 feet if be allowed by the city administrator or their
designee as an administrative variance to this section when the
applicant establishes that the height greater than 40 feet is
necessary to close a significant coverage or capacity gap in the
applicant's services or to otherwise provide adequate services to
customers, and the proposed antenna or facility is the least
intrusive means to do so within the right-of-way without violating
other restrictions within this article.
f. C olor: A personal wireless
telecommunication facility, including all related equipment and
appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings
of the pole, structure tower or infrastructure on which it is

an existing utility pole, alternative antenna support structure,
tower or city-owned infrastructure that incorporated guy wires
prior to the date that an applicant has applied for a permit.
k. Pole extensions: Extensions to
utility poles, alternative support structures, towers and city-owned
infrastructure utilized for the purpose of connecting a personal
wireless telecommunications antenna and its related personal
wireless telecommunications equipment must have a degree of
strength capable of supporting the antenna and any related
appurtenances and cabling and capable of withstanding wind
forces and ice loads in accordance with the applicable structural
integrity standards as set forth in 12 below. An extension must be
securely bound to the utility pole, alternative antenna structure,
tower or city-owned infrastructure in accordance with applicable
engineering standards for the design and attachment of such
extensions.
l. S tructural integrity: The personal

protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the
excavated material shall be deposited between the roadway and
the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where
right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing excavated
material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
iii. D rip line of trees. The utility shall
not trench within the drip line of any tree designated by the city to
be preserved.
(3) B ackfilling.
i. Any pit, trench, or excavation
created during the installation of facilities shall be backfilled for its
full width, depth, and length using methods and materials in
accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction." When excavated material is hauled away or
is unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
ii. For a period of three years from
the date construction of a facility is completed, the utility shall be
responsible to remove and restore any backfilled area that has
settled due to construction of the facility. If so ordered by the
director of public works, the utility, at its expense, shall remove
any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed
facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the
proper grades, as determined by the director of public works.
(4) P avement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility
installation or repair shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion
of the highway is closed to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth
in this paragraph (4) is permitted under section 20-274, the following
requirements shall apply:

the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
iii. In the case of water main or
service crossing, encasement shall be furnished between bore
pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed pipe is used
under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and
spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of installation
method.
iv. In the case of gas pipelines of
60 psig or less, encasement may be eliminated.
v. In the case of gas pipelines or
petroleum products pipelines with installations of more than 60
psig, encasement may be eliminated only if: (1) extra heavy pipe
is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and (2)
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.

Sec. 20-273. Vegetation control.
(a) E lectric utilities—Compliance with state laws and regulations.
An electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control activities
in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and regulations,
and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement with the city as
permitted by law.
(b) O ther utilities—Tree trimming permit required. Tree
trimming that is done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and
that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations
specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance
operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in
addition to any other permit required under this article.
(1) A pplication for tree trimming permit. Applications
for tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be
accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits
shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the
work will be expeditiously accomplished.
(2) D amage to trees. Poor pruning practices
resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall
be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for
assessment of damages. The city will require compensation for trees
extensively damaged and for trees removed without authorization. The
formula developed by the International Society of Arboriculture will be
used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or
unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the removal and
replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in
an unacceptable condition.
(c) S pecimen trees or trees of special significance. The city
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees
of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the
rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting
or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or
removing a facility.
(d) A bandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a
facility within the rights-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the utility to remove all
or any portion of the facility if the director of public works determines that such
removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the
event that the city does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to
remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the abandoning utility
shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of
the facility by another utility or person.

equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall
be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be
permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available.
(2) In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as
possible, notify the director of public works or his or her duly authorized
agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have
been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required

shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
(c) C onditions for granting of variance. The director of public
works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
(1) One or more conditions not under the control of
the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create
a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the
provision; and
(2) All other designs, methods, materials, locations
or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance
is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
(d) A dditional conditions for granting of a variance. As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the director of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that
may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the
purposes of this article.
(e) R ight to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by

provisions of this Code. There may be times when the city will incur delay or other costs,
including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its
permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility
that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or
overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
