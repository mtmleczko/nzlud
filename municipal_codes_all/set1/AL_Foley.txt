PREFACE 
    This Code is a republication of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this republication to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the republication. With this system, the republication will be kept up-to-date periodically. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the republication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this republication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the republication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President of Supplementation Department, and Rachael Calloway, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Victoria Southern, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.

However, in the alternative, if the violation is the first or second violation by the defendant of one (1) of the ordinances enumerated in Exhibit A to Ordinance No. 1112-10, then such defendant in lieu of appearing in municipal court pursuant to the summons and complaint, may pay the appropriate fine and court costs in addition to either of the following: 
(a)  Appearing before the municipal court magistrate, on or before the time specified in the summons, and entering a plea of guilty and waiver of trial provision on a form provided by the magistrate. A plea of guilty shall only be accepted by the magistrate after the defendant has executed a notice and waiver of rights form; or 
(b)  Signing the notice and waiver of rights form included with the summons and mailing the notice and payment of the fine and costs directly to the clerk of the court. Remittance by mail of the fine and costs shall constitute a guilty plea and waiver of trial, whether or not the guilty plea and waiver of trial provisions are signed by the defendant. Should the amount tendered be insufficient, such money received by the clerk shall be considered to be a partial payment of the lawful penalty, applied by the clerk to the fines and costs, and disbursed as required by law. The clerk may give notice of such insufficiency, and a supplemental summons and warrant of arrest shall be issued for the offender's arrest, and a judgment shall be entered by the magistrate of court for the balance of the penalty due. 
(Ord. No. 1112-10, § 1, 1-4-10)

In addition, anyone failing to appear in municipal court or otherwise to settle the matter by payment of the applicable fine and court costs shall be guilty of the separate offense of failure to appear, a misdemeanor, and punished in accordance with section 1-8, as applicable, and not in conflict with state law, regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was originally arrested.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 4-20. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Alabama has in the Code of Ala. 1975, Tit. 11, Ch. 19, § 1-24, Ch. 45, § 1-11, Ch. 52, § 1-84, and Tit. 41, Ch. 9, § 166, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Foley, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 1, § A, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. I, § A, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 4-21. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas in the corporate limits of the City of Foley, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 1, § B, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. I, § B, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 4-22. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands, and; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 1, § C, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. I, § C, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 4-23. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains. 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 4-35. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest flood formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters: 
(a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
(i)  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade, and; 
(iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
(b)  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and; 
(c)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 4, § A, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. 4, § A, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 4-36. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 4-35(4), "elevated buildings". 
(2)  Non-residential construction-New construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 4-34(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
(a)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: 
(i)  Individual lots or parcels, 
(ii)  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
(iii)  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivision, or 
(iv)  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
(b)  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) and is elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet) above grade. 
(c)  All Manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (Refer to section 4-35 above). 
(d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
(ii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 4-36(3)(a)-(c), above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 4-25, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(b)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
(c)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the building official. 
(d)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
(e)  Only if subsections 4-36(4)(b), (c), or (d) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 4, § B, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. 4, §§ B, C, 11-4-13) 
Sec. 4-37. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 4-25, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 4-25, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4 only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (4) shall apply:

(Ord. No. 1067-08, Art. 4, § E, 10-7-08; Ord. No. 13-1044, Art. 4, § B(4), 11-4-13) 
DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 4-40. - Variance procedures. 
(1)  The city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction and venue as allowed by state law. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal and State Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local flood plain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Section 1316: No new flood insurance shall be provided for any property which the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body, to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances which are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 44, Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3),(e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

The building official shall establish regulations and specifications for excavation and construction within the public rights-of-way for the protection of the public improvements and the protection of persons and property, and may place conditions on any permit as he shall deem necessary toward this goal.

The permit shall be kept at the site of the work and shall be exhibited upon requests to any law enforcement officer or city building official or his authorized representative. 
Utility agencies shall require the contractor who will actually be performing the work to obtain a permit. The contractor shall be required to furnish a bond as provided for herein, thereby assuming full responsibility for the work performed. Except as set forth herein, the contractor performing the work shall be the permittee.

The permittee will still be required to perform his work in complete compliance with all city standards and requirements. This section shall not apply to any governmental entities having an obligation or other mandate to perform work within public right-of-ways within the city or any other agents of the city performing work on behalf of the city unless specifically provided herein.

A noncancelable performance bond, letter of credit or cashier's check, in the amount of the cost of work or five hundred dollars ($500.00), whichever is greater, payable to the city, shall be required in the name of the permittee prior to issuance of any permit. Said bond shall assure that the permittee will comply with all the city standards and specifications and shall assure recovery by the city of any expenses incurred, within a period of one (1) year.

    The permittee, by acceptance of the permit, expressly guarantees complete performance of the work in an acceptable manner to the city, guarantees all work done by him for a period of one (1) year after the date of acceptance and agrees upon demand to maintain and make all necessary repairs during the warranty period. Failure to do so shall subject the permittee to forfeiture of his bond.

(g)  Penalties. Failure of the applicant to comply with any of the terms and conditions of the permit shall be sufficient cause for cancellation of the permit by the building official and may be cause for the refusal of future permits. The permit, the privileges granted by the permit, and the obligations of the permittee shall be binding upon the successors and subcontractors of the permittee. 
    Any person, firm corporation or other organization commencing any work without a prior valid written permit or contrary to the provisions of this section, shall be fined upon conviction not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), and cost of court for each offense. No further permits shall be issued to a party in violation of this section until all prior fines are paid. 
    Permit requirements shall apply to emergency repairs; however, a delay of forty-eight (48) hours is granted, excluding weekends and holidays, following the beginning of such repair before the lack of a permit shall warrant a fine. 
    Any excavation or construction in any street, alley, sidewalk, or other public right-of-way in the city (with or without a permit as required by this chapter) which constitutes an emergency presenting imminent danger of serious injury to persons or property is hereby declared to be a public nuisance which may be summarily abated as provided in the zoning ordinance of the city.

    The applicant/owner shall be required to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of, the development. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way. 
(d)  Design of curb and gutter and inlets. For curb and gutter application on proposed roadways, inlets shall be spaced such that flow from a 25-year design storm does not result in ponding water covering more than one-half (1/2) the width of the outermost traveling lane. 
    Curb inlets shall be designed so that surface water shall not be carried across any roadways nor for a distance of more than five hundred (500) feet in the gutter or valley. Inlets shall be located at uphill corners of each street intersection to prevent sheet flow of stormwater through the intersection In addition, double-wing inlets shall be placed at all vertical sags in the roadway. 
(e)  Analysis of upstream and downstream system. The layout shall include an appropriate conveyance of offsite flows that does not pass through required detention areas. Stormwater discharges from a developed site must be routed to an existing natural or manmade stormwater channel with adequate capacity. Calculations must be submitted that show the capacity of the receiving stormwater channel to handle the required design storms. The routing calculations must extend at least as far as the second downstream street crossing or to a named water body. Routing calculations must extend even further downstream, if the city engineer has reasonable concern about the capacity of a downstream stormwater channel based on scientific or engineering evidence. 
    Analysis of the downstream system shall include flow capacity and velocity for existing and proposed flow conditions, using manning's equation at a minimum. 
(f)  Detention design and construction. All site development projects requiring a land disturbance permit shall incorporate stormwater detention and first flush treatment, to reduce flooding potential and preserve or improve water quality. The first flush (WQV) shall be treated, infiltrated, or reused onsite to the maximum extent practicable using LID techniques. Stormwater detention is not required in the following two (2) situations: 
(1)  The project discharges stormwater runoff directly into a tidally influenced water body. This does not include discharges of stormwater runoff that flows through a public drainage system or across a downstream property boundary. 
(2)  Stormwater detention for a project site is either unwarranted or impractical. The design engineer shall submit complete hydrologic and hydraulic computations to support this conclusion. This conclusion must be affirmed by the city engineer. Typically this might occur in the very lowest downstream reaches of a major watershed, if it can be proved that undetained stormwater should be discharged quickly to avoid peak discharge timing for the entire watershed. The hydrologic analysis should include more than one (1) representative downstream location for comparing hydrographs. 
    Even if stormwater detention is waived for the above two (2) situations, the site development must still provide first flush treatment of the WQV in order to protect water quality. 
    If LID techniques are not employed due to site constraints, the detention basin shall detain the first one and one-quarter (1.25) inch of runoff (Rational Method) from a storm event and release the subsequent runoff water at a predevelopment rate. There should also be adequate sizing of the detention basin to store an accumulation of one-half (1/2) inch sediment during construction. The first flush volume for any stormwater detention structure must be contained and then slowly released over a minimum time period of twenty-four (24) hours and maximum time period of seventy-two (72) hours. 
    All stormwater detention structures must attenuate the post development peak flow rates from the two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year 24-hour design storms to release a graduated discharge at or below pre development peak flow rates. 
    Outfalls of detention areas shall be installed at least twenty-five (25) feet from any property line to allow velocity dissipaters to be installed if necessary for the prevention of offsite erosion. Exceptions may be approved by the Planning Commission for outfalls to approved drainage features such as an encased storm sewer system. 
(g)  Dry detention basins. 
    The maximum contributing drainage area to be served by a single dry detention basin is seventy-five (75) acres. Routing calculations must be used to demonstrate that the storage volume is adequate. 
    Vegetated embankments shall be less than twenty (20) feet in height and shall have no side slopes steeper than three-to-one (3:1). Riprap protected embankments shall be no steeper than two-to-one (2:1). Geotechnical slope stability analysis is required for embankments greater than ten (10) feet in height. The maximum depth of the basin should not exceed ten (10) feet. The detention basin shall be setback such that the outward toe of the berm is a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from the property line. 
    A low flow or pilot channel across the facility bottom from the inlet to the outlet required to convey low flows and prevent standing water. 
    Inflow channels are to be stabilized with flared riprap aprons, or the equivalent. A sediment forebay sized to one-tenth (0.1) inches per impervious acre of contributing drainage shall be provided for dry detention basins that are part of the treatment process during construction activities. 
    The outlet structure shall be sized based on hydrologic routing calculations and can consist of a weir, orifice, outlet pipe, combination outlet, or other acceptable control structure that achieves the required graduated discharge. 
    Riprap, plunge pools or pads, or other energy dissipaters are to be placed at the end of the outlet to prevent scouring and erosion. 
    An emergency spillway is to be included in the stormwater pond design to safely pass the extreme flood flow. A minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard must be provided, measured from the top of the water surface elevation for the extreme flood, to the lowest point of the dam embankment not counting the emergency spillway. 
(h)  Retention ponds. Geotechnical analysis shall be required to ensure proper retention and design. 
    A retention pond shall also provide the required storage above the permanent pool and meet the specified graduated allowable release. Stormwater ponds shall also be used to provide detention to control the required events. Where this is not required, the pond structure shall be designed to safely pass extreme storm flows. 
    Minimum setback requirements for stormwater pond facilities: 
(1)  Ten (10) feet from property line to outward toe of berm; 
(2)  One hundred (100) feet from private wells; 
(3)  Fifty (50) feet from a septic system tank/leach field. 
    Proper geometric design is essential to prevent hydraulic short-circuiting which results in failure of the pond to achieve adequate levels of pollutant removal. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the permanent pool shape is one-and-one-half-to-one (1.5:1), and should ideally be greater than three-to-one (3:1) to avoid short-circuiting. In addition ponds should be wedge-shaped when possible so that flow enters the pond and gradually spreads out, improving the sedimentation process. Baffles, pond shaping or islands can be added within the permanent pool to increase the flow path. 
    Maximum depth of the permanent pool should generally not exceed eight (8) feet to avoid stratification and anoxic conditions. Minimum depth for the pond bottom shall be four (4) feet. 
    Side slopes to the pond shall not exceed three-to-one (3:1). 
    The perimeter of all five (5) feet deep or greater pool areas should be surrounded by two (2) benches: safety and aquatic. For larger ponds, a safety bench extends approximately fifteen (15) feet outward from the normal water edge to the toe of the pond side slope. The maximum slope of the safety bench should be six (6) percent. An aquatic bench extends inward from the normal pool edge (fifteen (15) feet on average) and has a maximum depth of eighteen (18) inches below the normal pool water surface elevation. 
    Riprap, plunge pools or pads, or other energy dissipaters are to be placed at the outlet of the barrel to prevent scouring and erosion. An emergency spillway is to be included in the stormwater pond design to safely pass the extreme flood flow. The emergency spillway must be located so that downstream structures will not be impacted by spillway discharges. A minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard must be provided, measured from the top of the water surface elevation for the extreme flood to the lowest point of the dam embankment, not counting the emergency spillway. 
    A maintenance right-of-way must be provided to a pond from a public or private road. Maintenance access shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide, having a maximum slope of no more than fifteen (15) percent and be appropriately stabilized to withstand maintenance equipment and vehicles. The maintenance access must extend to the forebay, safety bench, riser, and outlet and, to the extent feasible, be designed to allow vehicles to turn around. 
    The principal spillway opening shall not permit access by small children, and endwalls above pipe outfalls greater than forty-eight (48) inches in diameter shall be fenced to prevent access. Warning signs should be posted near the pond to prohibit swimming and fishing in the facility.

Design guidelines shall be in compliance with the secretary of the interior's "standards for historic preservation projects" including the secretary's "standards for rehabilitation," taking into account local characteristics and goals. 
(c)  Procedures for granting or denying applications for certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  An application shall be submitted to the commission to begin the application process for a certificate of appropriateness. Each application shall be accompanied by plans for the proposed work, including drawings, photographs, plans or other documentation sufficient to show the appearance of the architectural design of the building or work contemplated, all as may be required by the commission.

Applications involving demolition or relocation shall be accompanied by post-demolition or relocation plans for the site. 
(2)  Except for applications considered under the commission's procedures for expedited review, all applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be considered by the commission after a public hearing. At least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, the commission shall notify the applicant of the time and place of the hearing and shall provide the applicant with a copy of any reports pertaining to the application. A notice shall be posted on the property indicating that an application is pending. The commission may take such further action as may be reasonably required to inform the owner of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application. 
(3)  Any applicant may appear in person before the commission in his own behalf and may present evidence. 
(4)  The commission may adopt an expedited procedure for approval of routine maintenance to historic properties, or to buildings or structures in a historic district. Such expedited procedure may waive the requirements of submission of an application for certificate of appropriateness and for consideration at a public hearing. 
(5)  The commission shall keep a record of applications for certificates of appropriateness and all its proceedings. 
(6)  In addition to the procedures set forth in this article, the commission shall adopt additional rules and regulations setting forth the procedure for submission and consideration of applications for certificates of appropriateness.

(1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(2)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days after the filing of a complete application by the owner of a historic property, or of a historic structure, site, object or work of art located within a historic district.

In addition, notice of the issuance or denial or a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by U.S. Mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
(3)  Failure of the commission to act within said forty-five (45) days shall constitute approval and no other evidence of approval shall be needed, and upon request the commission shall notify the building official that a permit may issue for the work specified. 
(4)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

The applicant, if he or she desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time. 
(5)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such cases, no building permit shall be issued. 
(6)  A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within one (1) year from the date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness are renewable. 
(7)  All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall strictly comply with the conditions of such certificate. 
(e)  Certificate of economic hardship.

(2)  The burden of proof rests on the applicant to show that the denial of the certificate of appropriateness will result in a substantial economic hardship. 
(3)  The applicant shall provide such information as may reasonably be required by the commission to establish the owner's claim of substantial economic hardship. The data provided by the applicant must be substantiated by either professionals in an applicable field or by thorough documentation of how the information was obtained. The commission may request additional information from the applicant as necessary to make informed decisions. Certificates of economic hardship are granted only to the applicant and are not transferable. 
(4)  In making its determination, the commission may consider, but is not limited to, the following described factors, evidence, and testimony: 
a.  Date the subject property was acquired and status of the property under this article at the time of acquisition, e.g. whether property was protected by this article, condition, etc.

1.  Any real estate broker or firm engaged to sell or lease the property; 
2.  Reasonableness of the price or rent sought by the applicant; and 
3.  Any advertisements placed for the sale or rent of the property by the owner or applicant. 
f.  Comments and/or reports from any community organizations, preservation groups, other associations and private citizens that wish to comment on a submission made under the financial hardware provision; and

1.  Perform normal maintenance and repairs; 
2.  The failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants; 
3.  The failure to prescribe a rental amount which is reasonable; 
4.  The failure to provide normal tenant improvements; and 
5.  The owner's purchase of the subject property after the enactment of the relevant provisions of this article without making said purchase contingent upon the owner's first obtaining the approvals required by this article. 
(5)  The commission shall hold a public hearing as soon as practical but not longer than forty-five (45) days of receipt of a completed application for a certificate of economic hardship. Notice shall be provided in the same manner the commission uses for hearings on certificates of appropriateness. At the hearing, the commission shall take testimony presented by the owner and any other interested parties on the standards set forth above. The commission shall issue its decision within forty-five (45) days of the hearing. 
(6)  If the commission fails to timely hold a public hearing, or having conducted a hearing fails to render a decision within forty-five (45) days, the applications for a certificate of economic hardship shall be deemed granted. 
(7)  If the commission determines to deny the application for a certificate of economic hardship, the applicant shall be notified in writing and shall be provided a copy of the commission's final order. 
(8)  A certificate of economic hardship may be subject to conditions, including design guidelines, for subsequent construction not inconsistent with the standards set forth in this article and the design guidelines.

APPENDIX 1 - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 
I. Title 
    This ordinance shall be known as and called the "Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance." 
II. Jurisdiction 
    The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all lands within the corporate limits of the City of Foley and subdivision developments within the planning jurisdiction of the City of Foley. 
III. Purpose 
    During the construction process, soil is most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches, and the dredging of watercourses. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to provide a healthy living environment for the citizens of Foley. 
    As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design, construction, use, and maintenance of land disturbance in the City of Foley. 
IV. Definitions 
    Alabama Handbook for Erosion Control, Sediment Control and Stormwater Management on Construction Sites and Urban Areas (Alabama Handbook) - Volume 1 and Volume 2 from the Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee provides guidance for the prevention or minimization of problems related to erosion, sedimentation and stormwater management on construction sites and eroding urban areas. It provides a basis for developing sound plans implementing appropriate measures (BMPs). 
    Best management practice (BMP) - Actions which landowners, developers, and/or contractors can take to reduce the impact of human activity on the natural environment. BMPs to control pollutant discharges from land disturbance can be divided into two (2) main categories: erosion controls and sediment controls. Erosion and sediment controls can each be further described as permanent controls or temporary controls. BMPs shall meet or exceed recognized effective industry standards as outlined in the Alabama Handbook. 
    Clearing - Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover. 
    Drainageway - Any channel that conveys surface runoff throughout the site. 
    Erosion and sediment control plan - Research, planning, processes, activities, and practices implemented for the prevention and/or minimization of pollutants in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable. This plan identifies site-specific measures and sequencing to be used for the control of erosion and sediment on a development site before, during and after construction. 
    Erosion control - Measures that prevent and/or minimize erosion (process by which the land surface is worn away). 
    Grading - Excavation or fill of material, including the resulting conditions thereof. 
    Land disturbance permit - A permit issued by the City of Foley for the construction or alteration of ground as required by Ordinance No. 371-86 [§§ 4-4-4-7 of the City Code]. 
    Perimeter control - A barrier that prevents sediment from leaving a site either by filtering sediment-laden runoff, or diverting it to a sediment trap or basin. 
    Phasing - Clearing a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the stabilization of each phase before the clearing of the next. 
    Qualified credentialed professional (QCP) - means a professional engineer, certified professional in erosion and sediment control (CPESC), registered landscape architect, registered land surveyor, professional geologist, registered forester, registered environmental manager, or a certified professional soil scientist. The QCP shall be able to document requirements regarding proven training, relevant experience, and continuing education. The QCP shall be in good standing with the authority granting the registration or designation. 
    Sediment control - Measures that prevent and/or minimize eroded sediments from leaving the site. 
    Stabilization - The use of practices that prevent exposed soils from eroding. 
    Start of construction - The first land disturbing activity associated with a development, including land preparation such as clearing, excavation, grading, and filling. 
    Watercourse - Any body of water, including, but not limited to creeks, rivers, streams, and bays. 
    Waterway - A channel that directs surface runoff to a watercourse, or to the public storm drain. 
V. BMP Permits 
A.  Best management practices permits shall be required for land disturbing activities that uncover more than five hundred (500) square feet of ground except land disturbances as noted in Section V.B. 
B.  BMP permits shall not be required for the following activities: 
1.  Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property, or natural resources. 
2.  Existing nursery, silviculture and agricultural operations conducted as a permitted main or accessory use. 
VI. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan 
A.  Applicable for developments classified as multifamily, subdivisions, commercial, and industrial construction. 
B.  Plan shall be designed by a qualified credentialed professional (QCP) such as a professional engineer. 
C.  Plan shall at a minimum include the following: 
1.  Map identifying topography, natural features such as watercourses, waterways, and wetlands, and proposed construction areas. 
2.  Sequence of construction of the development, such as clearing and grading, drainage installation, utility installation, infrastructure and building construction, and landscaping. 
3.  Erosion and sediment controls used throughout all phases of construction and details of permanent stabilization methods to be used at completion. 
4.  Provisions for maintenance of erosion and sediment controls and periodic inspections for effectiveness of controls. 
D.  Submittal, Review, and Approval Procedures: 
1.  Erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted in conjunction with the land disturbance permit. 
2.  Review of each erosion and sediment control plan shall be within thirty (30) days of submittal to determine the plan's conformance with these provisions. Failure of the city to act on original or revised erosion and sediment control plan within thirty (30) days of receipt shall authorize the ability to proceed in accordance with the plans submitted. 
3.  The city shall, in writing: 
a.  Approve the plan as it meets and/or exceeds the Alabama Handbook. 
b.  Approve the plan with reasonable, justifiable conditions to accomplish objectives of the provisions. 
c.  Disapprove the plan, indicating deficiencies and procedure for submitting a revised plan. 
E.  Modifications to the Plan:

2.  Minor modifications to the erosion and sediment control plan, such as the use of additional temporary BMPS, may be addressed on site as needed to ensure compliance with the provisions. 
VII. Erosion and Sediment Control Contract 
A.  Applicable for single-family and double-family residential construction. 
B.  In lieu of an approved erosion and sediment control plan prepared by a QCP, single-family and double-family residential construction may complete an erosion and sediment control contract. 
C.  The contract shall include the BMPs to be used during the construction process and the final stabilization measures to be implemented. 
D.  The landowner and/or contractor shall comply with all design requirements as described within this ordinance. 
VIII. Design Requirement 
    Erosion control practices, sediment control practices, and waterway crossings shall meet the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of the Alabama Handbook for Erosion Control, Sediment Control and Stormwater Management on Construction Sites and Urban Areas and shall be adequate to prevent transportation of sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the City of Foley.

B.  Erosion Control: 
1.  Soils must be stabilized by temporary or permanent erosion control fourteen (14) days after clearing or inactivity in construction. 
2.  If vegetative erosion control methods, such as seeding, have not become established within four (4) weeks, the City of Foley may require that the site be reseeded, or that a nonvegetative option be employed. 
3.  On steep slopes or in drainageways, special techniques that meet design criteria outlined in the Alabama Handbook shall be used to ensure stabilization. 
4.  Soil stockpiles must be stabilized at the end of each work week or if significant rainfall is anticipated. 
5.  Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site onto adjacent properties. 
6.  Techniques shall be employed to divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes. 
C.  Sediment Controls: 
1.  Sediment controls shall be provided in the form of sediment basins or sediment traps and perimeter controls. 
2.  Where possible, sediment basins shall be designed in a manner that allows adaptation to provide long term stormwater management. 
3.  Adjacent properties shall be protected by the use of a vegetated buffer strip, in combination with perimeter controls. 
D.  Waterways and Watercourses: 
1.  When a watercourse must be crossed regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided, and an approval obtained from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. 
2.  When in-channel work is conducted, the channel shall be stabilized after the work is completed. 
3.  All on-site stormwater conveyance channels shall be designed according to the criteria outlined in the Alabama Handbook. 
4.  Outlets of all pipes and paved channels shall have adequate stabilization to prevent erosion. Riprap may be required for stabilization if vegetative measures prove to be ineffective at controlling erosion in waterways or watercourses. 
E.  Construction Site Access: 
1.  A stabilized construction access shall be required on all multifamily, subdivision, commercial and industrial developments in order to ensure sediment is not tracked onto public streets from the construction site. 
2.  If heavy sediment tracking occurs on public streets, it may be required to remove accumulated sediments from streets and ditches. 
F.  Completion of Construction Activities: 
1.  All open channels and ditches shall be permanently vegetated upon final inspection. Seed and mulch shall not be accepted. If sod is used on slopes, corners will need to be pinned per the Alabama Handbook.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-1017 , Exhibit A, adopted June 16, 2014, amended article V in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article V, §§ 9-81-9-98, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ordinance No. 929-06. 

Sec. 9-81. - Findings. 
    The city council does hereby find that: 
    The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, has concluded that: 
(1)  Secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; 
(2)  Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; 
(3)  Exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer; 
(4)  There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; 
(5)  Establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke; and 
(6)  Evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smokefree policies and laws do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006.) According to the 2010 U.S. Surgeon General's report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, even occasional exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful and low levels of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke lead to a rapid and sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels, which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoking-Attributable Disease: A Report of the Surgeon General. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2010.) 
    Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 53,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
    The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," US. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
    Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women; heart disease; and death. (California Air Resources Board (ARB), "Appendix II Findings of the Scientific Review Panel: Findings of the Scientific Review Panel on Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant as adopted at the Panel's June 24, 2005 Meeting", California Air Resources Board (ARB), September 12, 2005.) 
    There is indisputable evidence that implementing one hundred (100) percent smokefree environments is the only effective way to protect the population from the harmful effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. (World Health Organization (WHO), "Protection from exposure to secondhand smoke: policy recommendations," World Health Organization (WHO), 2007.) 
    In reviewing eleven (11) studies concluding that communities see an immediate reduction in heart attack admissions after the implementation of comprehensive smokefree laws, the institute of medicine of the national academies concluded that data consistently demonstrate that secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks and that smokefree laws reduce heart attacks. (Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Committee on Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Acute Coronary Events, "Secondhand smoke exposure and cardiovascular effects: making sense of the evidence," Washington, DC: National Academies Press, October 2009.) 
    A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
    Studies measuring cotinine (metabolized nicotine) and NNAL (metabolized nitrosamine NNK, a tobacco-specific carcinogen linked to lung cancer) in hospitality workers find dramatic reductions in the levels of these biomarkers after a smokefree law takes effect. Average cotinine levels of New York City restaurant and bar workers decreased by eighty-five (85) percent after the city's smokefree law went into effect. ([n.a.], "The State of Smokefree New York City: A One Year Review," New York City Department of Finance, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City Department of Small Business Services, New York City Economic Development Corporation, March 2004). After the implementation of Ontario, Canada's Smokefree Indoor Air Law, levels of NNAL were reduced by fifty-two (52) percent in nonsmoking casino employees and cotinine levels fell by ninety-eight (98) percent. (Geoffrey T. Fong, et. al., "The Impact of the Smokefree Ontario Act on Air Quality and Biomarkers of Exposure in Casinos: A Quasi-Experimental Study," Ontario Tobacco Control Conference, Niagara Falls, Ontario, December 2, 2006.) 
    Following a Health Hazard Evaluation of Las Vegas casino employees' secondhand smoke exposure in the workplace, which included indoor air quality tests and biomarker assessments, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) concluded that the casino employees are exposed to dangerous levels of secondhand smoke at work and that their bodies absorb high levels of tobacco-specific chemicals NNK and cotinine during work shifts. NIOSH also concluded that the "best means of eliminating workplace exposure to [secondhand smoke] is to ban all smoking in the casinos." ( Health hazard evaluation report: environmental and biological assessment of environmental tobacco smoke exposure among casino dealers, Las Vegas, NV. By Achutan C, West C, Mueller C, Boudreau Y, Mead K. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH HETA No. 2005-0076 and 2005-0201-3080, May 2009.) 
    Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9. ) 
    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328: 980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
    Given the fact that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smokefree environments. ASHRAE has determined that there is currently no air filtration or other ventilation technology that can completely eliminate all the carcinogenic components in secondhand smoke and the health risks caused by secondhand smoke exposure, and recommends that indoor environments be smokefree in their entirety. (Samet, J.; Bohanon, Jr., H.R.; Coultas, D.B.; Houston, T.P.; Persily, A.K.; Schoen, L.J.; Spengler, J.; Callaway, C.A., "ASHRAE position document on environmental tobacco smoke," American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), 2005.) 
    During periods of active smoking, peak and average outdoor tobacco smoke (OTS) levels measured in outdoor cafes and restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor tobacco smoke concentrations. (Klepeis, N.; Ott, W.R.; Switzer, P., "Real-time measurement of outdoor tobacco smoke particles," Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association 57: 522-534, 2007.) Nonsmokers who spend six-hour periods in outdoor smoking sections of bars and restaurants experience a significant increase in levels of cotinine when compared to the cotinine levels in a smokefree outdoor area. (Hall, J.C.; Bernert, J.T.; Hall, D.B.; St Helen, G.; Kudon, L.H.; Naeher, L.P., "Assessment of exposure to secondhand smoke at outdoor bars and family restaurants in Athens, Georgia, using salivary cotinine," Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene 6(11): 698-704, November 2009.) 
    Residual tobacco contamination, or "thirdhand smoke," from cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products is left behind after smoking occurs and builds up on surfaces and furnishings. This residue can linger in spaces long after smoking has ceased and continue to expose people to tobacco toxins. Sticky, highly toxic particulate matter, including nicotine, can cling to walls and ceilings. Gases can be absorbed into carpets, draperies, and other upholsteries, and then be reemitted (off-gassed) back into the air and recombine to form harmful compounds. (Singer, B.C.; Hodgson, A.T.; Nazaroff, W.W., "Effect of sorption on exposures to organic gases from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)," Proceedings: Indoor Air 2002, 2002.) Tobacco residue is noticeably present in dust throughout places where smoking has occurred. (Matt, G.E.; Quintana, P.J.E.; Hovell, M.F.; Bernert, J.T.; Song, S.; Novianti, N.; Juarez, T.; Floro, J.; Gehrman, C.; Garcia, M.; Larson, S., "Households contaminated by environmental tobacco smoke: sources of infant exposures," Tobacco Control 13(1): 29-37, March 2004.) Given the rapid sorption and persistence of high levels of residual nicotine from tobacco smoke on indoor surfaces, including clothing and human skin, this recently identified process represents an unappreciated health hazard through dermal exposure, dust inhalation, and ingestion. (Sleiman, M.; Gundel, L.A.; Pankow, J.F.; Jacob III, P.; Singer, B.C.; Destaillats, H., "Formation of carcinogens indoors by surface-mediated reactions of nicotine with nitrous acid, leading to potential thirdhand smoke hazards," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) 107(15): 6576-6581, February 8, 2010.) 
    Unregulated high-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or "e-cigarettes," closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a number of e-cigarettes from two (2) leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA's testing also suggested that "quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent." ([n.a.], "Summary of results: laboratory analysis of electronic cigarettes conducted by FDA," Food and Drug Administration (FDA), July 22, 2009; http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm173146.htm Accessed on: October 22, 2009.) E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. 
    The Society of Actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000.00) a year: five billion dollars ($5,000,000,000.00) in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and four billion, six hundred million dollars ($4,600,000,000.00) in lost productivity. (Behan, D.F.; Eriksen, M.P.; Lin, Y., "Economic Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke," Society of Actuaries, March 31, 2005.) 
    Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree. Creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. and Smith, L., "The effect of ordinances requiring smokefree restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States." American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic impact of smokefree workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
    There is no legal or constitutional "right to smoke." (Graff, S.K., " There is No Constitutional Right to Smoke: 2008, " Tobacco Control Legal Consortium, 2nd edition, 2008.) Business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke. On the contrary, employers have a common law duty to provide their workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous. (Graff, S.K.; Zellers, L., "Workplace Smoking: Options for Employees and Legal Risks for Employers," Tobacco Control Legal Consortium, 2008.) 
    Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business and Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
    The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance.

Not more often than every five (5) years, the approving authority may request that the provider or applicant, at either of their expense, furnish certification from an engineer that the facilities and support structures are in sound condition. Should that engineer deem those structures unsound, the provider or applicant shall furnish to the approving authority a plan to remedy any unsafe conditions or structural defect(s) and take that remedial action at the provider or applicant's expense, as directed by the approving authority.

(b)  The approving authority will review and administratively process any request for a permit to determine whether, in the exercise of the approving authority's reasonable discretion, it should be issued for the location and in the manner requested. In this process, the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the placement of the proposed small cell technology facility and associated accessory equipment or support structure on private property is the minimal physical installation which will achieve the technological goal of enhancing the provision of personal wireless services. Except as set forth in this section, this permitting process will not require the approval of any city council or city employee other than the approving authority. 
(c)  The factors, guidelines and requirements that the approving authority may consider and will apply when determining whether to issue a permit for placement of facilities and any associated accessory equipment or support structure on private property include, but are not limited to, the factors and requirements set forth in section 10-72. 
(d)  The guidelines in section 10-72 to utilize existing poles and support structures for the placement of facilities and accessory equipment are also applicable when considering whether to permit the installation of those facilities and support structures on private property, provided that city council approval is not required before a permit is issued to place a new pole or other support structure on private property if that action is appropriate. 
(e)  The provider or applicant shall use stealth technology when installing the facilities and associated accessory equipment on any building or accessory to that building that is located on private property. Further, stealth technology should be used when placing facilities on other types of support structures on private property unless the applicant can reasonably demonstrate that, given the nature of the requested application, the use of such technology is: 
(1)  Unnecessary; or 
(2)  Impractical. 
(f)  If facilities are placed on an existing or new building or accessory to that building, the following dimensional regulations shall apply:

(3)  The antenna component of the facilities shall be limited to a maximum height of three (3) feet and a maximum width of two (2) feet; provided that authorization to install antenna up to six (6) feet in height may be permitted if a showing of the technological need for such equipment is made and other requirements of this section are met. 
(g)  Accessory equipment must be located in an equipment cabinet, equipment room in an existing building or in an unmanned equipment building. If the equipment building is freestanding, it shall conform with respect to building setbacks, size, and location. Further, if an equipment building or cabinet is located in a residential zone, or the nearest adjoining property is in a residential zone, that building or cabinet shall be surrounded by landscaping to provide a screen of the same height as the building or cabinet. 
(h)  Except as provided in subsections (h)(i) and (h)(ii) immediately below, the same application process that is set forth in section 10-73 will be utilized when processing any request for a permit to place facilities or support structures on private property, except that: 
(1)  City council approval to install a new support structure on private property is not a condition for a permit to place facilities thereon; and 
(2)  If the facilities are located on private property that is not owned or exclusively used by the applicant, instead of providing the documentation contemplated in section 10-73, the applicant shall present a license, lease, agreement or other documentation indicating that owner of said property authorizes the applicant the rights to place the facilities thereon and access thereto, or that such owner agrees in principle to grant the applicant those rights; provided that, if a representation is made to the city that the owner of private property has agreed in principle to grant those rights but the applicant subsequently fails to furnish the city documentation that finalizes any such agreement, the city may refuse to issue the requested permit until that documentation is provided, or, if the city issues the requested permit before receiving such final documentation, the subject permit and license may be revoked. 
(i)  All facilities and support structures shall be installed, erected, and maintained in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations of the FCC. At least triennially following the installation of the facilities or associated support structures, upon reasonable request and for good cause, the applicant shall furnish the approving authority a written certification from a professional engineer licensed in the State of Alabama indicating that those structures have been inspected and are being maintained, operated and used in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those of the FCC that pertain to the transmission of wireless communication signals. For purposes of this provision, "good cause" shall mean circumstances have arisen that indicate the facilities and associated support structures have been damaged, are not functioning in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or otherwise pose a hazard to the public. If those structures fail at any time to comply with said laws and regulations, the provider or applicant shall begin to cause those structures to be brought into compliance with said laws and regulations within fifteen (15) days of the date of any written notice to either of them of such noncompliance, or cease all personal wireless communications operations related to those structures until the provider or applicant comes into full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The facilities and associated support structures on private property must at all times be maintained in good and safe condition. 
(j)  Permit and license fees. The provider or applicant for a permit to place facilities and associated support structures on private property shall pay the following fees:

The city may require the provider or applicant, at their expense, to remove and reclaim the abandoned facilities within sixty (60) days from the date of written notice of abandonment given by the city to them and to reasonably restore the condition of the property at which the facilities are located to that existing before they were installed. If the provider or applicant fails to remove and reclaim its abandoned facilities within such sixty-day period and the facilities are located on the right-of-way, the city shall have the rights to:

Sec. 10-80. - Collocation. 
    To promote the public interest that is served by collocating facilities and associated accessory equipment on existing support structures and thereby mitigating the installation of additional support structures throughout the city, no person or entity (including any provider, applicant, utility, or franchisee) that utilizes an existing support structure that is located on right-of-way or on private property in the city and has space available thereon may deny a provider or applicant the right to use or access an existing support structure for purposes of attaching facilities permitted by this article without sound operational, technological or other good reason. 
( Ord. No. 18-2009, § 10, 5-24-18 )

(h)  Nothing herein contained, nor shall any detention of the minor be construed, so as to prevent prosecution of the minor for violation of any existing ordinance or law. 
(i)  Any word, phrase or provision used in this section which is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or unenforceable shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this section.

ARTICLE II. - ALARM SYSTEMS 

Sec. 11-50. - Definitions. 
    As used in this article, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them: 
    Alarm system: Any mechanical or electrical device that is arranged, designed, or used to signal the occurrence in the city of a burglary, robbery, or other criminal offense, fire emergency or medical emergency requiring urgent attention, and to which police, fire, or emergency medical personnel are expected to respond. Alarm systems include those through which public safety personnel are notified directly of such signals through central monitoring stations or are notified indirectly by way of third persons who monitor the alarm systems and who report such signals to the fire or police department. Alarm systems also include those designed to register a signal which is so audible, visible, or in other ways perceptible outside of a protected building, structure or facility as to notify persons in the neighborhood beyond the zoning lot where the signal is located who in turn may notify the police or fire department of the signal. Alarm systems do not include those affixed to automobiles. Alarms in separate structures are to be counted as separate systems even though owned by same person or entity. 
    False alarm: An alarm signal eliciting a response by the police or fire department when a situation requiring a response by the police or fire department does not in fact exist. False alarm does not include an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user. Alarms resulting from the following conditions are not considered false alarms: 
(1)  Criminal activity. 
(2)  Earthquake causing structural damage to the protected premises. 
(3)  High winds sufficient to activate motion detection system and causing physical damage to the protected premises. 
(4)  Flooding of the protected premises due to overflow or natural drainage. 
(5)  Lightning bolt causing physical damage to the protected premises. 
(6)  Telephone line malfunction verified in writing to the city by at least a first line telephone company supervisor, or by safety personnel on the scene of an alarm. 
(7)  Communication to the police or fire department before a unit is dispatched to investigate clearly indicating that the alarm resulted from authorized entry, authorized system test, or other noncriminal cause. 
(8)  An alarm call on the reasonable but mistaken belief that a burglary, robbery, or other criminal offense, fire emergency, or medical emergency is in progress. 
(9)  Fire alarms caused by a power failure. 
    User: Any person who purchases, leases, contracts for, or obtains an alarm system. 
(Ord. No. 427-90, § 2, 2-19-90) 
Sec. 11-51. - Purpose. 
    Alarm systems provide a vital service to residents, businesses and the entire city; however, false alarms pose a hazard to police officers, firefighters and the general public, that divert police officers and firefighters from useful duties and, therefore, cause a waste of police and fire services. The purpose of this article is to reduce or eliminate the incidents of false alarms.

(b)  If the police or fire department personnel at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, such officers shall make a report of the false alarm and notify the alarm user of the response. 
(c)  The chief of police or fire chief shall have the right to inspect any alarm system on the premises to which a response has been made, and he may cause an inspection of such system to be made at any reasonable time thereafter. The chief of police/fire chief, or designee, will notify the company so it or its agent may be present at the time of inspection. 
(Ord. No. 427-90, § 6, 2-19-90; Ord. No. 13-1028, §§ 4, 5, 3-4-13) 
Sec. 11-56. - Notifications of alarms. 
    When a private central monitoring system, a third party, or an individual, is alerted by any means of an alarm of any type, they shall without delay notify the police/fire dispatch of such alarm so the proper emergency equipment can be dispatched. Failure to comply with this section will be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and otherwise punished as provided in City of Foley Code of Ordinances, section 1-8 general penalty; violations of code, ordinance or state law.

Any failure to respond to the premises within thirty (30) minutes after requested to do so shall be deemed a failure to respond. 
(Ord. No. 427-90, § 8, 2-19-90) 
Sec. 11-58. - Excessive false alarms; fee assessment. 
(a)  If any alarm system produces three (3) false alarms in any calendar year, the chief of police/fire chief, or designee of the involved department shall initiate an investigation as to the cause and circumstances surrounding the false alarms. If deemed necessary, the chief of police/fire chief, or designee, shall provide written notice of the fact, which shall be given by certified mail or delivery to the subscriber asking the user to take corrective action in regard to false alarms and informing user of the false alarm fee schedule provided herein.

ARTICLE II. - TRAFFIC IMPACT REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 13-51. - Purpose and general policy. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to require that development within the City of Foley is supported by an adequate roadway network to accommodate the continuing growth and development of the city. Acquisition of new rights-of-way for off-site, abutting, and internal streets to support new development is necessary and desirable. The city requires that: 
(1)  Development impacts from new developments are mitigated through contributions of street rights-of-way and/or improvements to existing and new roadways; and 
(2)  Adequate infrastructure for new development is adequately evaluated and addressed. 
(b)  There must be a rough proportionality between the traffic impacts created by a new development and the requirements placed on the property owner or applicant for a new development to dedicate and improve off-site and abutting city streets. The city will evaluate the project and determine what dedications, if any, are required to address both the nature and the extent of the impact that results from the proposed development. The city desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of transportation system improvements. It is the city's intent to institute a procedure to assure that mandatory street construction requirements are proportional to the traffic demands created by the new development. 
(Ord. No. 1025-08, 1-21-08) 
Sec. 13-52. - Applicability. 
(a)  The regulations in this section apply to existing and future transportation networks associated with land development activities within the city. Any application for site development in accordance with this Code must comply with these standards. However, applicability shall not include single-family residential or multifamily developments which consist of thirty-five (35) or fewer dwellings. 
(b)  The city engineer may require the developer of any residential, multifamily, commercial, or industrial development within the city limits and its jurisdictional area to conduct a traffic impact study (TIS) if there is a reasonable expectation that the development may cause one (1) or more of the following conditions: 
(1)  Produce trip generations during the peak hour in excess of seventy-five (75) vehicles per hour; 
(2)  A change in land use which may increase the trip generation during the peak hour in excess fifty (50) vehicles per hour; 
(3)  A rezoning application where the proposed zoning may result in trip generation during the peak hour in excess of seventy-five (75) vehicles per hour; 
(4)  An additional access by an existing facility to a City of Foley roadway that the city does not consider to be necessary for safe and efficient movement of traffic; or 
(5)  Any new development that the City of Foley determines may impact the transportation network or that the city feels that the development shall be coordinated with adjacent developments. 
The referenced threshold requirements for a traffic impact study (TIS) are included in the Traffic Impact Study Requirements, City of Foley, Alabama, as adopted by the Foley City Council. Said document shall be the guideline for developing the TIS. 
(c)  Where project development may take place in multiple phases, the developer shall submit a development plan that includes the proposed development plans for all subsequent phases. That is, an overall development plan shall be submitted along with the initial phase development plan. The intention of this section is to enable adequate evaluations of the traffic impact anticipated when all phases of the development are complete. 
(Ord. No. 1025-08, 1-21-08) 
Sec. 13-53. - Participation by the city. 
(a)  Participation by the City of Foley in infrastructure improvements resulting from the traffic impact study shall not be construed to mean assistance of a financial nature relating to the easement acquisition, construction, or engineering costs. 
(b)  During the course of providing for improvements, the city shall cooperate with the developer in the use of its governmental powers to assist in the timely and cost effective implementation of improvements. Specifically, the city may agree to: 
(1)  Assist in the acquisition of necessary rights-of-way and easements; 
(2)  Assist in the relocation of utilities; 
(3)  Assist in obtaining approvals from Baldwin County; 
(4)  Assist in obtaining approvals from ALDOT; 
(5)  Assist in securing financial participation for major thoroughfare improvements from Baldwin County, ALDOT, or other area wide transportation planning and management entities as may be established in the future. 
(Ord. No. 1025-08, 1-21-08) 
Sec. 13-54. - City evaluation and actions. 
(a)  The city shall evaluate the adequacy of the traffic impact study (TIS) prepared by the applicant. Based upon such evaluation, the city shall determine: 
(1)  Whether the applicant may be approved in the absence of dedication of rights-of-way or construction of improvements to each affected thoroughfare; and 
(2)  The extent of the applicant's obligations to make such dedications or improvements. 
(b)  The application for which a TIS is being conducted shall not be approved until the city is satisfied with the financial arrangements related to required transportation improvements. 
(c)  The city shall condition the approval of the development application on one (1) or more of the following acts by the applicant: 
(1)  Delay or phasing of development until thoroughfares with adequate capacity or intersections improvements are constructed; 
(2)  Reduction in the density or intensity of the proposed development sufficient to ensure that the roadwork has adequate capacity to accommodate the additional traffic to be generated by the development; 
(3)  Dedication or construction of thoroughfares or traffic control improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impacts generated by the proposed development. 
(d)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion thereof.

(Ord. No. 607-99, § 2, 5-25-99) 
Sec. 14-18. - Same-Shared access. 
    The applicant may propose a joint-use or shared access with a consensual adjoining property owner. This may facilitate the granting of a permit that allows for left-turn movements where either or both lots would otherwise not be able to have the same. Two (2) or more lots sharing a common access unit will be treated as one (1) unit, and the combined vehicular traffic volumes will determine the access control requirements. A perpetual condition shall be written into the deed for each lot establishing the shared access. These conditions and applications will be reviewed by the traffic consultant on a case-by-case basis and a recommendation will be made to the permitting agency. If such a connection to a planned access roadway is determined to be reasonable by the traffic consultant, the connection may be approved by the permitting agency. 
(Ord. No. 607-99, § 2, 5-25-99) 
Sec. 14-19. - Same-Interchange.

Sec. 15-22. - Operation of golf carts on certain public streets permitted and regulated. 
(a)  Policy statement. This section is enacted pursuant to the authority of the Alabama Constitutional Amendment adopted pursuant to Act No. 2016-271. In enacting this section, the city council confirms its view that golf carts are not designed or manufactured to be suitable for use on public streets and roads, and the City of Foley in no way advocates or endorses the operation of golf carts on public streets. The city understands that residents within golf course residential communities and other communities desire to have the option to operate their golf carts on a limited basis within those communities in order to access the amenities in and immediately adjacent to those communities, and have secured the adoption of Act No. 2016-271 to allow the enactment of ordinances permitting such operation in Baldwin County subject to the terms of the Act and to such other restrictions the city may impose as authorized by the Act. In designating public streets on which golf carts may be legally operated, the Act requires the city to determine that golf carts may safely travel on such designated streets after consideration of factors including, but not limited to, the speed, volume, and character of motor vehicle traffic using the street. The designation in this section of certain streets as streets on which golf carts may safely travel is not a determination or representation by the city that operation of golf carts on such streets is in fact safe or advisable even if done in accordance with this section due to the limited drive characteristics and safety features of golf carts. All persons operating golf carts must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. All persons who operate or ride carts on public streets inside the City of Foley do so at their own risk and peril, and no permit for the operation of a golf cart on the public streets shall be issued except upon execution by the owner of the golf cart of a written undertaking to indemnify and hold the city, its officials, officers, agents, and employees harmless from any and all liability of any kind or character directly or indirectly associated with such operation. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    Cart shall mean a golf cart equipped with approved seat belts for each occupant, head lights, brake lights, turn signals, a windshield, a rear view mirror, efficient brakes, horn, reliable steering apparatus, safe tires, and red reflectorized warning devices on both the front and rear and an orange warning flag displayed at least six (6) feet above the ground. Exception, however, any state tagged cart or municipal service vehicle. Cart shall not mean a dune buggy (open chassis off-road recreational vehicle primarily designed or modified for off-road use on sand dunes or beaches). Cart shall not mean an ATV or something other than a golf cart though it may, in appearance, look like a golf cart. Questionable carts shall be determined by the police department during the inspection process. 
    Designated cart street shall mean the following public streets within the corporate limits of the City of Foley, Alabama designated under this section for the use of carts, to be marked with appropriate signage, approved by the police chief, advising that the street may be utilized by carts:

    Municipal service vehicle shall mean a city operated state tagged cart or other city operated motorized equipment or vehicle when in service for the provision of public safety or public maintenance services. 
    State tagged cart shall mean a golf cart, low speed vehicle, or neighborhood electric vehicle that is registered with and licensed by the State of Alabama under Code of Ala. Title 32. 
(c)  Rules and regulations. Carts may not be operated on any public street, road, or highway within the corporate limits of the City of Foley that is not a designated cart street and may be operated on designated cart street only in accordance with the following rules and regulations.

(3)  Any person who operates a cart on a designated cart street must adhere to all state and municipal laws applicable to the operation of motor vehicles, including, without limitation, all laws concerning the operation of a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The operator of a cart may not overtake and pass in the same lane occupied by the vehicle being overtaken. A cart may not be operated between lanes of traffic or between adjacent lines or rows of vehicles, and carts may not be operated two (2) or more abreast in a single lane. The operator of a cart may, in a safe manner, cross over, perpendicular, a street with a speed limit greater than twenty-five (25) mph, to continue on to the other side of low speed streets.

The owner or occupant of the land on which the non-residential enterprise is conducted must own the residential lot; no fee may be charged for parking on the residential lot; and the residential lot may not be used for off-street loading. The abutting lots may be separated by a street or alley. The Board may require certain conditions and safeguards for the adequate protection of the adjoining property and subject property. 
( Ord. No. 19-2006, 3-4-19 ) 
Sec. 10.2 - Buffers. 
    Buffers shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Tables 10.2.4 and 10.2.5 and as described in this section. In cases where buffers are required or deemed necessary for the protection and/or separation of uses on abutting lots, the following provisions shall constitute the minimum requirements for each unless otherwise specified by the reviewing authority in individual cases. For the purposes of this Section, "fences" and "walls" shall have the same meaning, but shall not include the term "retaining wall". 
10.2.1  General Requirements. 
A.  One hundred (100) percent of the applicable buffer requirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except when the new use is developed abutting an existing more intensive use developed prior to the adoption of these standards and for which no buffer is in place. In this case, the new use shall be responsible for providing a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required buffer. 
B.  Whenever the proposed use abuts an existing use on a property that is designated for another use within the Comprehensive Master Plan, the approving authority may modify the required buffer in accordance with the projected use. 
C.  Whenever the proposed use abuts an existing use in a district in which such neighboring use is nonconforming, the approving authority may modify the required buffer in accordance the type(s) of use permitted by the nonconforming use's zoning classification or projected by the Comprehensive Master Plan, whichever is less. 
D.  Whenever the proposed use abuts a vacant property, the buffer required shall be based on the zoning of the abutting property or the use projected by the Comprehensive Master Plan, whichever is less. 
E.  If the use relationships between two (2) abutting lots changes so that a lesser buffer would be required, the width of the buffer may be reduced accordingly. 
F.  If the required buffer abuts a public right-of-way, up to one-half (1/2) of the right-of-way width may be counted toward the buffer width requirement. 
G.  Golf courses, playfields, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts and other recreational facilities; parking and other vehicular use areas; buildings, dumpsters, and outdoor storage are prohibited in required buffers. 
H.  Where desirable and upon receipt of a written agreement between the affected property owners, the Commission may permit a pedestrian access way along a wall provided as part of a required buffer, to allow access to and from an abutting residential use. 
I.  Buffer requirements may be more stringent if located adjacent to a wetland or stream bank. Refer to City of Foley Ordinances for wetland and stream bank buffer requirements. 
10.2.2  Design Requirements. 
A.  Any required buffer abutting a park or greenway shall be waived in its entirety, if the property owner dedicated that land to be set aside for the required full buffer width to the City for incorporation into the park or greenway, such land dedication shall be deemed acceptable only upon approval of the Mayor and City Council. 
B.  In accordance with the following standards, the width of a required buffer may be reduced by up to fifty (50) percent if a wall together with landscaping (including trees) is used and up to twenty-five (25) percent if a berm together with landscaping is used: 
1.  Any wall shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials, wood posts and planks, or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials, or any combination thereof, as may be approved by the reviewing authority. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the wall surface shall be left open, and the finished side of the wall shall face the abutting property. Chain-link fencing with plastic, metal, or wooden slats shall not be permitted. 
2.  Walls shall be a minimum of six (6) ft high and shall avoid a stockade appearance. This can be accomplished through any or a combination of the following methods: adding an evergreen hedge on the finished side of the wall, using supports of a different material or by undulating the plan of the wall. Walls over one hundred (100) linear feet shall have no more than fifty (50) percent of their length in a straight line, unless the entire wall is set back five (5) ft or more from the lot line, with evergreen planting provided within such setback. 
3.  Berms shall be a minimum of four (4) ft in height with a maximum slope of three to one (3:1). Berms in excess of six (6) ft in height shall have a maximum slope of four to one (4:1) as measured from the exterior lot line. Berms shall be landscaped and stabilized to prevent erosion. 
[C.]  Refer to the City Ordinances for recommended tree plantings and planting requirements. Native vegetation is highly recommended for buffer plantings. 
10.2.3  Landscaping Requirements. 
A.  Existing natural vegetation, which meets, in whole or in part, buffer planting requirements, may be applied toward the requirements of this Section. All plants shall be suitable for local planting conditions and the intended landscaping purposes. All exposed beds shall be maintained with mulch and shall be a minimum of two (2) inches deep at installation. 
B.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least thirty (30) inches tall at installation with an average height of five (5) to six (6) ft to be expected as normal growth within four (4) years. However, twenty-five (25) percent of the shrubs may vary from this standard. The permitted variations are that such shrubs: 
1.  May be deciduous; 
2.  May be two (2) ft tall when planted, provided an average height of three (3) to four (4) ft is expected as normal growth within four (4) years; and 
3.  When planted on a berm, may be of a lesser height, provided that the combined height of the berm and planting is at least six (6) ft. after four (4) years. 
C.  Deciduous trees shall have a minimum of two-and-one-half (2 1/2) inch caliper and be a minimum of ten (10) ft in height at installation. At installation, evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six (6) ft in height and multi-stemmed trees shall be eight (8) ft in height. 
D.  All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachments by curbs, wheel stops, or other permanent barriers.

ARTICLE XI. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 

Sec. 11.1 - Site Plan Review. 
    A zoning site plan review is a procedure designed to assist a developer in interpreting the Zoning Ordinance so that proposed developments will stand a better chance of not violating this Ordinance. Ultimate responsibility for compliance with this Ordinance rests with the land owner, developer, tenant, or person who is responsible for the building, structure, lot or use. 
    A zoning site plan review shall be required to be made in all cases on new construction, remodeling or refurbishing of existing structures, demolition and rebuilding on existing lots, and the change of occupancy or use of any structure, regardless of the district. 
    A conceptual review may be performed with the Community Development Director, and/or other City Staff during the planning stages of a project, but this will not be considered a formal review. Formal reviews will only be made on submitted, finalized plans. 
    Site plans may be required to be submitted to the Planning Commission for input in cases where the proposed development meets the following criteria: 
A.  Multi-family and commercial developments where the total area exceeds three (3) gross acres. 
B.  Commercial developments where the total structure area exceeds fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. 
C.  Places of amusement over three (3) acres. 
    The Community Development Director and/or other City Staff will review the site plan and advise the applicant of changes that must be made in the plans so as to comply with the Zoning Ordinance. Such changes shall be accomplished prior to the issuance of a building permit. Site plan review is a service to the applicant that is performed by municipal employees and officers in their official capacities. The failure of the reviewing officials to recognize or notice a violation or the incorrect interpretation of the reviewing officials at the site plan review stage shall not prevent or prohibit the City of Foley and these same officials from enforcing the Zoning Ordinance against an applicant if a structure, lot, or use of land conflicts with this Ordinance. 
11.1.1  Site Plan Contents. 
A.  Boundary survey including acreage and easements; 
B.  Location of bordering right-of-ways; 
C.  Location, occupancy type, square footage, height & setbacks of proposed structures;

15.1.1  R-3 Residential Multi-Family. 
    Special Provisions: Multiple family housing, because of increased densities, often generates large, bulky buildings and large parking areas. This type of development can be incompatible with surrounding uses. If these developments are not properly designed the large buildings and parking areas can dominate the site and leave only small remnants of open space that does not adequately provide for the recreational needs of the residents. 
1.  Location: 
Multiple family residential sites shall be located on a Major or Collector Roads as designated on the Major Road Plan. These sites shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and shall only be permitted where multiple family residential land use is indicated on the adopted plan. 
2.  Application Requirements: 
All applications for R3 shall furnish the following information to the Planning Commission: 
a.  A preliminary traffic analysis indicating the probable effect of the proposed development on traffic patterns and capacities of adjacent streets in the immediate area. 
b.  Official letters of commitment of utility services to the proposed Multiple Family Residential from the appropriate water, sewer, electric, gas and other utilities. 
3.  Site Plan Review: Site Plan review shall be required for all R-3 Multiple Family Residential Developments as provided in Article 11.1 of this Ordinance. 
4.  Site Design Guidelines: Building Orientation 
a.  Each multiple family development shall reflect a site orientation suited to the surrounding topography, neighborhood setting and community. When adjacent to single family residential, the site orientation shall take into account the height, bulk, and character of the surrounding development to avoid conflicts. The developments shall be designed in a manner to integrate them into the neighborhood rather than an abrupt intrusion into the neighborhood. 
b.  Arrange buildings to provide functional public and private outdoor spaces. Avoid developments that are "facing inward" and offer no relationship to the adjoining neighborhoods and greater community. 
c.  Orient multiple family buildings to the adjacent public streets by providing large windows, porches, balconies and entryways or other entry features on the street side of the buildings. Avoid the creation of blank street-facing walls that create unattractive streetscapes. 
d.  Building ends shall contain windows and active spaces to provide additional security and visual interest. 
e.  Site Plans shall be designed with a variation in both the street patterns and the sighting of structures so the appearance of the streetscape does not become overly repetitive. Avoid continuous lines of buildings with the same setback. 
5.  Off Street Parking: 
a.  Off street parking shall be designed in a way to minimize the visual prominence of vehicles and to minimize the potential pedestrian conflicts. 
b.  Parking shall not be located in the front yard of the development. The parking shall be located behind the street setback to the side and rear of the buildings, wherever possible. 
c.  Parking areas visible from the public street rights-of-way and adjacent properties shall be screened from view with landscape elements, low profile walls or berms, or other types of visual barriers and screens. 
d.  Landscaping and walkways shall be located between buildings and paved parking areas. Avoid parking vehicles directly against a building or structure. 
e.  Shade trees shall be designed into all parking areas to provide for natural shading and provide for proper aesthetics. 
f.  Enclosed garages and carports may be permitted. All carport roofs visible from public streets or adjacent properties shall reflect the overall design and character of the residential structures in the development. 
g.  All garages, carports, exterior storage of boats, recreational vehicles and trailers shall be fully enclosed or sufficiently screened when visible from public street or adjacent properties. 
6.  Open Space: 
a.  The open space provided in multiple family residential developments shall address both active and passive outdoor open space uses. Open space shall be designed to enhance the overall appearance and compatibility of the development. 
b.  Include sufficient open spaces in the form of squares, greens and parks. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of open space shall be provided in all multiple family developments. Stormwater retention areas are not included in this twenty-five percent (25%) open space requirement, unless it is properly designed and determined to be acceptable open space by the Planning Commission. 
c.  Retain existing mature trees within the new project design and landscaped areas where possible. Extra effort should be made to retain existing trees and vegetation adjacent to single family residential areas. 
d.  Open space shall be distributed throughout the development and easily accessible to all residents. Open space should not be concentrated in large areas that are inconvenient to residents of the development. 
7.  Landscaping: 
a.  Adequate landscape screens shall be provided along the perimeter of all multiple family developments. Where multiple family developments are located adjacent to single family residential, a dense landscape screen shall be provided. 
b.  On perimeter streets, sidewalks, streetscape plantings shall be provided. These screens shall include street trees and landscaping where necessary to screen parking and other areas. 
c.  Dense landscaping and/or architectural elements shall be provided to screen unattractive views and features, such as outdoor storage areas, trash enclosures, mechanical equipment and other similar equipment. 
d.  Landscape plans shall include placement of deciduous shade trees around the east, west and south sides of residential buildings to help reduce cooling loads during the summer and permit solar gain during the winter months. 
e.  Wall-mounted or ground-mounted utility equipment such as transformers, electric and gas meters, electrical panels, junction boxes and transformers shall be screened by walls, berms, fences and/or landscaping. 
f.  All utility lines including electric, telephone, gas and cable television lines shall be placed underground in each development. 
8.  Accessory Structures and Elements: 
a.  Accessory structures and amenities, such as community rooms, recreation facilities, swimming pools, mail rooms/kiosks, laundry rooms, garages and carports shall be centrally located and easily accessible by residents. 
b.  Multiple family developments with one hundred fifty (150) or more dwelling units shall provide a recreation facility and swimming pool. The design of accessory structures and elements shall be consistent with the predominate architectural theme of the residential buildings with regard to roof pitch, exterior materials and colors. 
c.  Trash and garbage storage areas shall be enclosed by solid, durable and attractive walls with solid screen doors. The materials shall be similar in color to the residential buildings. These enclosures shall be screened with appropriate landscaping. They shall be situated to minimize views from public streets and to avoid impacting adjoining properties. 
d.  Trash and garbage storage areas shall be located convenient to all residents. These enclosures shall be sufficient to accommodate both waste disposal and recycling containers. 
9.  Lighting: 
a.  All exterior lighting shall be architecturally integrated with the building style, materials, and colors. 
b.  Parking areas, entry drives, and pedestrian walks shall be illuminated to allow for proper vehicular movements and promote pedestrian safety and security. All lights shall be pedestrian in scale and spaced for proper energy efficiency. This lighting shall be inward directed and not impact adjacent properties. Light standards shall be no taller than sixteen (16) feet in height. The use of building lights to illuminate parking areas is prohibited. 
c.  Landscape plantings and lighting shall be coordinated. Appropriate light pole locations shall not conflict with mature landscaping. 
10.  Additional Requirements: 
The Special Requirements provided above are specific requirements to multiple family developments. Other requirements may be provided in the Zoning Ordinance and other City Ordinances and Regulations that further impact the design and development of multiple family properties. Additional requirements include but are not limited to: signage; parking and loading; landscaping and screening requirements and engineering and stormwater retention requirements.

H.  The digital billboard sign face must not be located beside, above, or below any other standard billboard sign face or digital billboard sign face on the same pole or support structure (no double faced billboards in which one (1) or both sign faces aimed in the same direction of travel is an electronic changeable copy sign). 
I.  The digital billboard sign face may not be located in a historic district, a residential district, or be visible from either residentially zoned property or from property being used for residential purposes. 
J.  The digital billboard must at all times adhere to the then-current technical specifications established by the City of Foley, which may be amended from time-to-time, but which currently provide as follows: 
1.  Digital billboards may only display static messages or images and they may not have any effects or appearance of movement, travel, fade, pulse, blinking, animation, scrolling, flashing, or similar effects; 
2.  Digital billboard messages or images cannot change more frequently than once every eight (8) seconds; 
3.  Digital billboard images must transition instantly as seen by the human eye, and shall not use blinking, fading, rolling, shading, dissolving, or similar effects as part of the image transition or change. 
4.  Each digital billboard shall be equipped with automatic light intensity controls and automatic ambient light monitors to control their level of illumination. The digital billboard must automatically adjust based on ambient light conditions to ensure that each sign face does not exceed illumination changes of 0.3 (three-tenths) of a foot-candle over ambient light levels if measured from the nearest property line of an abutting landowner (excluding public rights-of-way) or from two hundred fifty (250) feet away from the sign face (for six hundred seventy-two (672) SF signs), from two hundred (200) feet away from the sign face (for three hundred seventy-eight (378) SF signs, from one hundred fifty (150) feet away from the sign face for signs smaller than three hundred seventy-eight (378) SF, whichever is closer. Certification must be provided to the City demonstrating that each sign has been preset to automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or lower. Re-inspection and recalibration may periodically be required by the City in its reasonable discretion, and when required it shall be completed within thirty (30) days at the sign owner's expense. During an inspection, one (1) hour or more following sunset, a properly calibrated light meter shall be used to obtain an ambient light reading in footcandles for the location with the digital sign either turned off or displaying a solid black copy, then the digital sign shall be turned on to full, standard white copy (color temperature six thousand five hundred (6,500) degrees Kelvin) to take another reading with the same meter at the same location. If the difference between the two (2) readings is 0.3 (three-tenths) of a footcandle or less, then the illumination level from the sign relative to ambient light is properly adjusted. 
5.  Notwithstanding ambient light levels, each digital billboard sign shall be programmed so that its luminance does not exceed certain maximums. No digital billboard shall exceed six thousand five hundred (6,500) nits when measured from the sign's face at its maximum brightness between the time of one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise and one-half (1/2) hour before sunset as per the National Weather Service. No digital billboard shall exceed three hundred (300) nits when measured from the sign's face at its maximum brightness between the time of one-half (1/2) hour before sunset and one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise as per the National Weather Service. Certification must be provided to the City demonstrating that each sign has been preset to these maximum limits. Re-inspection and recalibration may periodically be required by the City in its reasonable discretion, and when required it shall be completed within thirty (30) days at the sign owner's expense. During an inspection a luminance meter shall be used to obtain a reading in Nits when the digital sign is turned on to full, standard white copy (color temperature six thousand five hundred (6,500) degrees Kelvin). 
6.  Written certification from the digital sign manufacturer must be provided certifying that the light intensity of the sign has been preset to be within the brightness levels specified in this Ordinance, and that the preset intensity level is protected from end user manipulation by password protected software or other approved method. 
7.  Each digital billboard sign face shall contain a default design that will freeze the device and message or image in one (1) position with a maximum luminance of three hundred (300) nits if any malfunction occurs. 
8.  Each digital billboard sign face shall contain a "kill switch" which can cause the sign face to go dark regardless of the nature of any type of malfunction, and any malfunction that causes an image or message to be displayed causing movement, flashing or any similar effects, or exceeding the brightness levels established hereby, must be remedied or caused to go dark or static within six (6) hours. 
K.  For each standard billboard sign face that the owner desires to convert to a digital billboard sign face, the owner must first remove a minimum of four (4) eligible standard billboard sign faces (including the standard sign face that is being converted). Eligible standard billboard sign faces being removed and not converted are those that are: 
1.  Located inside the corporate limits of the City of Foley; 
2.  Located on the same road as the proposed digital billboard (unless the owner and the Community Development Director agree otherwise to facilitate the removal of billboards on a National Scenic Byway, a residential area, a historic district area, or other such locations where billboards are deemed more out of character). 
3.  Not otherwise in violation of law or that are not otherwise required to be removed pursuant to government action; 
L.  The operator of a digital billboard shall immediately, upon request, publish emergency information on each digital billboard such as weather alerts, Amber alerts, and similar law enforcement emergencies and announcements; 
M.  The operator of a digital billboard shall, if reasonably requested, donate available advertising spots to the City of Foley for public announcements. 
Sec. 22.13 - Conversion of Legal Nonconforming Billboard Double Stacked Sign into One Sign Face. 
    Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Zoning Code to the contrary, a legal nonconforming billboard double stacked sign may be converted into a single sign face by filling in the gap area between the legal nonconforming sign faces without losing its legal nonconforming status, but only in the following circumstances and only subject to the following conditions: 
A.  The owner of the billboard double stacked sign must first apply for and receive a Double Stacked Billboard Conversion Permit from the Community Development Department which is both a building permit for the to-be-converted billboard sign faces and a demolition permit for the to-be-removed billboard or billboard sign face; 
B.  The legal nonconforming billboard sign faces being merged together must remain in their same location, at their same angle and direction of travel, with the top of the higher sign face no higher than before and the bottom of the lower sign face no lower than before; 
C.  The only allowed increase in the size of the sign faces shall be the area of the gap located between the legal nonconforming sign faces that are stacked one (1) on top of the other; 
D.  The billboard merged stack sign may not be a digital billboard or have any electronic changeable copy; 
E.  For each billboard double stacked sign that the owner desires to convert to a billboard merged stack sign, the owner must first remove or decommission one (1) eligible billboard sign face. Multiple conversions may be proposed on the same application or on contemporaneously filed applications by the same owner to maximize the use of the removal or decommission credit. Decommission in this context means to leave the sign face up, but permanently remove it from displaying any advertising copy and only have it display trees, clouds, and other non-commercial City of Foley approved images until such time as the entire billboard support structure and all sign faces are removed. Unless the entire billboard, including the pole and all sign faces, is being removed, the sign faces shall be decommissioned rather than physically removed for aesthetic reasons. At the time all the sign faces on a particular billboard support structure are decommissioned or due to be decommissioned, the owner shall remove the entire billboard support structure. Billboard sign faces that are eligible for removal or decommission credit are those that are: 
1.  Located inside the corporate limits of the City of Foley; 
2.  Not otherwise in violation of law or that are not otherwise required to be removed pursuant to government action; 
3.  In existence at the time of the application;

Sec. 24.19 - Site Layout. 
    Proposed development must submit to the Planning Commission for approval a detailed site layout plan or master plan.

    Site Plan Contents: 
A.  Most recent survey showing all property boundaries and easements. 
B.  All bordering streets, avenues, roadways, or other public ways. 
C.  Parking lots, ingress and egress, proposed and existing landscaping. 
D.  Placement and dimensions of proposed and existing structures. 
E.  Proposed colors and facades of structures. 
F.  Locations and types of signage. 
G.  Use/Occupancy type of the property and structures. 
H.  Tax parcel number of lot or lots proposed for use. 
I.  The site plan shall be of a scale not to be greater than one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet nor less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet and of such accuracy that can readily interpret the site plan, and shall include more than one (1) drawing where required for clarity. 
Sec. 24.20 - Building Scale. 
    Building heights including parapets and other architectural embellishments should be varied reflecting the individualized character of retail architecture. All street level units should serve a retail or commercial purpose; upper stores may serve additional retail, commercial, professional office space or residential uses. 
Sec. 24.21 - Building Orientation. 
    No matter which way a structure faces, buildings adjacent to the Foley Beach Express should present an architectural façade, or use landscaping areas, on the Foley Beach Express side of the structure for aesthetic appeal. In some developments it may be appropriate to incorporate service alleys for facilitating development of multiple-sided street frontages. However, other parts of a development may benefit from holding street activity to one (1) side, while the back side may incorporate a parking deck or other parking facilities as well as service accommodations. 
Sec. 24.22 - Access and Entry Points. 
    While primary entry points would relate to major intersections along the Foley Beach Express, site development patterns should facilitate internal traffic circulation and incorporate multiple options for gaining access to and from the development. This reduces the need for local traffic on the Foley Beach Express by ensuring connection to the surrounding neighborhoods. Entry points should address the Foley Beach Express with Gateways. Entry streets should contain building facades oriented in a manner to provide interest to the Foley Beach Express travelers. 
Sec. 24.23 - Architectural Style and Exterior Finishes. 
    All exterior finishes should reflect local or regional design, consistent within the development. As with building heights, materials, size and placement of windows and doors, awnings, overhangs and paint selections should be varied throughout the development. The plan would discourage the City from approval of architectural specifications which contain repetitive features often referred to as "cookie cutter" design schemes. 
Sec. 24.24 - Parking Design with Tree Canopy and Green Buffers. 
    Traditional street front parking should be incorporated for purposes of convenience and in keeping with the typical and desirable look of an active, populated, and vibrant town center. Additional parking should be buffered with landscape and vegetated material in accordance with City landscape standards. 
Sec. 24.25 - Walkability, Biking and Other Alternative Modes of Transportation. 
    The City encourages sidewalks, bicycle accommodations and other methods of alternative transportation. Sidewalks should be of comfortable width (in no case less than five (5') feet) and may have varied surfaces ranging from concrete to brick and stone. Sidewalks and bike lanes should connect throughout any development and adjacent neighborhoods. Attractive bicycle racks should be incorporated throughout the development. The adopted Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan should be used as a guideline. 
Sec. 24.26 - Proposed Greenways. 
    If applicable, each site review should include connection to the proposed greenway system adopted as part of the City of Foley Comprehensive Plan. 
Sec. 24.27 - Signs. 
    Sandwich-type board signs are allowed on the sidewalk/right-of-way but shall not be an impediment to pedestrian traffic or block required ingress/egress paths of existing businesses. The signs are only allowed during the hours the business is open to the public and must be placed in front of the store front. The signs cannot exceed six (6) square feet. 
Sec. 24.28 - Displays. 
    Merchandise may be allowed on the sidewalk/right-of-way but shall not be an impediment to pedestrian traffic or block required ingress/egress paths of existing businesses. Only merchandise permitted to be sold on the premises may be displayed outdoors. Merchandise is only allowed during the hours the business is open to the public and must be placed directly at the store front. 
Sec. 24.29 - Outdoor Dining. 
    Sidewalk dining areas, extending from existing restaurants, on the public right-of-way must be approved by City staff. If City staff has any concerns with the request, it may be forwarded to City Council for a decision. The areas cannot be an impediment to pedestrian traffic or block required ingress/egress paths of existing businesses. The number of allowable outdoor seats shall be no greater than thirty (30) percent of the total permitted occupancy inside the restaurant. This use may require temporary buffers for the safety of the diners. 
Sec. 24.30 - Mobile Merchandise Vendors. 
    Temporary approval may be granted on the sidewalk/right-of-way but must be approved by City Council. The vendors cannot be an impediment to pedestrian traffic or block required ingress/egress paths of existing businesses. Vendors must have proper licenses to operate including but not limited to a City of Foley business license. 
Sec. 24.31 - Mobile Food/Sidewalk/Street Vendors. 
    Temporary approval may be granted on the sidewalk/right-of-way but must be approved by City Council. The vendors cannot be an impediment to pedestrian traffic or block required ingress/egress paths of existing businesses. Vendors must have proper licenses to operate including but not limited to a City of Foley business license. 
Sec. 24.32 - Alabama Coastal Connection Scenic Byway. 
    The purpose of the Alabama Coastal Connection Scenic Byway is "to identify, preserve, protect and enhance scenic, historic, natural, recreational, cultural and archaeological resources; enhance recreation; and, promote economic development through tourism and education in the history, culture and natural beauty of the City of Foley and coastal Alabama." A map of the Byway can be found at www.alabamacoastalconnection.com .

The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit forthwith to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. Such proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
