PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    Various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a period, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 10 is numbered 10.01 and the fourth section of Chapter 51 is 51.04. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 50 and 51, it will be designated as Chapter 51.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and E. Dodman March, Supplement Editor, and Judy Mixon, Supplement Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Sandra Johnson, City Clerk for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment.

    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed.

    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer reportable on the member's W-2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered, or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions for service earned prior to May 1, 2013. 
    For members hired prior to May 1, 2013, for service earned on or after May 1, 2013, salary shall not include more than 300 hours of overtime per calendar year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of 300 hours per year accrued as of May 1, 2013 and attributable to service earned prior to the May 1, 2013, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after May 1, 2013.

The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period.

a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund.

In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
(i)  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to section (d)(6)b.3. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee.

c.  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby, to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this section, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(e)  Contributions. 
(1)  Member contributions. 
a.  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of nine percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
b.  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(3)  City contributions. Commencing on May 5, 2005, the city shall make bi-weekly contributions to the fund un an amount equal to ten and one-half percent of the total salary of plan members (in lieu of the city contribution to the defined contribution program). 
(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(f)  Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(1)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of Credited Service or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of Credited Service. Each member shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the City after attaining normal retirement age. 
(2)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three and nine- hundredths percent (3.09%) of average final compensation, for each year of credited service, for member's who retire prior to October 1, 2015. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three and twenty-seven hundredths percent (3.27%) of average final compensation, for members who retire on or after October 1, 2015. 
(3)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(4)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
a.  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
b.  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (f)(4)a., reduced by three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer. 
(5)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(g)  Pre-retirement death. 
(1)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(2)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection (j)(7). 
d.  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (g)(2)a. or b., elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
e.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 701/2. 
f.  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (g)(2)a. or b., but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(3)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse/beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
a.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
b.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
c.  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection (j)(7). 
d.  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (g)(3)a. or b., elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
e.  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (g)(3)a. or b., but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
f.  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
g.  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(h)  Disability. 
(1)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and nine- hundredths percent (3.09%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall [be] 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
a.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
b.  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (h)(2)b., the following definitions apply: 
    Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
    Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof 
    Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
    High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
    Occupational exposure means, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
i.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(A)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(B)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(C)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(D)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
ii.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
iii.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
i.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
ii.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and nine- hundredths percent (3.09%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
a.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
b.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
c.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
d.  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
e.  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this section may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
a.  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
b.  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsection (j)(1)a. or b., which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two and three quarters percent (2.75%) of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(i)  Vesting. If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than five years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has five or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to either: 
a.  A refund of the member's accumulated contributions plus amounts contributed on behalf of the city effective October 1, 1991, at the rate of six percent and effective on and after May 5, 2005, at the rate of ten and one-half percent of salary; or 
b.  A deferred monthly benefit, computed as for normal retirement, which is payable at the otherwise normal retirement date or, on a reduced basis, at the otherwise early retirement date provided the member does not elect to with draw his or her own contribution to the find. 
(j)  Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
a.  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
b.  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
c.  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this subsection, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (j)(1)b.) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this subsection, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in subsection (k). 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
a.  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under the pre-retirement death section. 
b.  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
c.  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (j)(1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with subsection (k). 
d.  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f)(1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
e.  The member's benefit under this subsection must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(6)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(k)  Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (k)(1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this subsection shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(l)  Claims procedures. 
(1)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in the state statutes. 
(m)  Reports to division of retirement. Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(n)  Roster of retirees. The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this section in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(o)  Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this subsection, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (o)(1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
a.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
b.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
i.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
ii.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and: 
i.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and 
ii.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
c.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (o)(2)a. and b. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this subsection, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
a.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
b.  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
c.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the members first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
a.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
b.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (o)(5)a. shall not apply. 
c.  The reductions provided for in subsection (o)(5)a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to subsection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
d.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (o)(1), such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this subsection to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (o)(1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to subsection (h), or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to subsection (g). 
(7)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this subsection with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (o)(8) if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (o)(8) shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(9)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service credit purchase limits. 
a.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in subsection (y) and (z), then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
    For purposes of applying subsection (o)(10)a.1., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (o)(10)a.2. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (o)(10)b.2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution limits. 
a.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (o)(11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
i.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
ii.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subsection (o)(11)b.1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
c.  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
d.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (o)(11). shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this subsection shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under 26 U.S. Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under U.S. Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under U.S. Code Section 415(b). 
(p)  Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(1)  General rules. 
a.  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this subsection. The provisions of this subsection will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
b.  Precedence. The requirements of this subsection will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
c.  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection other than this subsection (p)(1)c., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and manner of distribution. 
a.  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
b.  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (p)(2)b., other than subsection (p)(2)b.1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
    For purposes of this subsection (p)(2)b. and subsection (p)(5), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (p)(2)b.4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (p)(2)b.1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (p)(2)b.1.), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
c.  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
d.  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this subsection. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
a.  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one-year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to subsection (f), (g), (i), or (j) (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under the pre-retirement death section, above is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(4)  General distribution rules. 
a.  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
b.  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(5)  Definitions. 
    Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
    Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the members death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to the pre-retirement death section. 
(q)  Miscellaneous provisions. 
(1)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(2)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(3)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(4)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions.

(6)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(7)  Vesting. 
a.  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
b.  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(8)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(9)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 185.08. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the System which violates the requirements of F.S. ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
(r)  Repeal or termination of system. 
(1)  This section establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this section shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this section, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this section who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting 100 percent of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(3)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to find all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
b.  The board shall, determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (r)(3)c. 
c.  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (r)(3)b. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity.

    Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. 
    Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows:

There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the city and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this subsection for prior service with any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in the maximum pension section of the plan document

d.  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive.

A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself 
b.  Individual accounts-Records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
c.  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP'S assets. 
d.  Limitation of liability. 
1.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
2.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(6)  General provisions. 
a.  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section (aa) for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
b.  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
c.  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
d.  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
e.  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
f.  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
g.  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
h.  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
i.  Written elections, notification. 
1.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
2.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
j.  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
k.  Construction. 
1.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of the state, except where other applicable law controls.

Sec. 33.28. - Canvassing of absent elector's ballot. 
(a)  The supervisor of elections shall receive the voted absentee ballot, at which time the supervisor may compare the information on the voter's certificate on the back of the envelope with the information and the signature of the elector in the registration books to determine whether the elector is duly registered in the city and may record on the elector's registration certificate that the elector has voted. The supervisor shall safely keep the ballot unopened in his office until the canvassing board canvasses the vote according to law. The canvassing board may begin the canvassing of absentee ballots at 7:00 a.m. on the day of the election, but not later than noon on the day following the election; however, the counting of votes on absentee ballots shall begin no earlier than 7:00 p.m. on the day of the election. The canvassing board shall compare the ballots presented to it by the Supervisor for canvass with the record required by F.S. 101.62(3), so as to compare the number of ballots in its possession with the number of requests for ballots received to be counted according to the supervisor's file or list, to ensure that all the absentee ballots to be counted by the canvassing board are accounted for. The canvassing board shall, if the supervisor has not already done so, compare the information on the back of the envelope and the signature of the elector with the registration book to see that the elector is duly registered in the city and has not voted on election day and to determine the legality of the absent elector's ballot. If it is determined by the canvassing board that any vote is illegal, then some member of the board shall, without opening the envelope, mark across the face of the envelope: "rejected as illegal." The envelope and the ballot contained therein shall be preserved in the manner that official ballots voted are preserved. 
(b)  If an elector or candidate present believes that any absentee ballot is illegal due to any defect apparent on the voter's certificate, he may, at any time before the ballot is removed from the envelope, file with the canvassing board a protest against the canvass of such ballot, specifying the precinct, the ballot, and the reason he believes such ballot to be illegal. No challenge based upon any defect in the voter's certificate shall be accepted after the ballot has been removed from the mailing envelope. 
(c)  The canvassing board shall then record the ballot upon the proper record, unless the ballot has been previously recorded by the supervisor of elections. The mailing envelope shall be opened and the secrecy envelopes shall be mixed so as to make it impossible to determine which secrecy envelope came out of which signed mailing envelope; however, when an electronic or electromechanical voting system is used, the ballots may be sorted by ballot styles and the mailing envelopes may be opened and the secrecy envelopes mixed separately for each ballot style. The votes on absentee ballots shall included in the total vote of the city. 
(d)  The supervisor of the chairman of the canvassing board shall,, after the board convenes, have custody of the absent electors' ballots until a final proclamation is made as to the total vote received by each candidate or on each issue.

(Ord. 93-41, passed 9-13-93) 
Sec. 35.12. - Local preference in purchasing or contracting. 
    Except where otherwise provided by federal or state law or other funding source restrictions or as otherwise set forth in the purchasing policy. The City of Port St. Lucie shall give preference to local businesses in the following manner: 
(a)  "Local Business" defined: 
"Local business." For the purposes of this section, "local business" shall mean a business which meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Has had a fixed office or distribution point located in and having a street address within St. Lucie, Indian River, Martin or Okeechobee County for at least one year prior to the issuance of the request for competitive bids or request for proposals by the City. The fixed office or distribution point must be staffed. Post office boxes are not verifiable and shall not be used for the purpose of establishing a physical address; and 
(2)  Holds any business tax receipt required by the City of Port St. Lucie (City). 
(b)  Certification. Any vendor claiming to be a local business as defined by subsection 35.12(a) above, shall so certify in writing to the City of Port St. Lucie's Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The certification shall provide all necessary information to meet the requirements of subsection 35.12(a) above. OMB shall not be required to verify the accuracy of any such certifications, and shall have the sole discretion to determine if a vendor meets the definition of a "local business." 
(c)  "Non-local business" means a bidder which is not a local business. 
(d)  Preference in purchase of commodities and services by means of competitive bid. Under any such applicable solicitation, bidders/proposers desiring to receive local preference will be invited and required to affirmatively state and provide documentation as set forth in the solicitation in support of their status as a local business. Any bidder who fails to submit sufficient documentation with their bid offer shall not be granted local preference consideration for the purposes of that specific contract award. Except where federal or state law, or any other funding source, mandates to the contrary, the city will give preference to local businesses in the following manner: 
Competitive bid (local price match option). When a qualified and responsive, non-local business submits the lowest best value bid, and the bid submitted by one or more qualified and responsive local businesses is within five percent (5%) of the price submitted by the non-local business, then the local business with the apparent lowest best value bid offer (i.e., the lowest local bidder) shall have the opportunity to submit an offer to match the price(s) offered by the overall lowest best value non-local bidder. In such instances, staff shall first verify if the lowest non-local bidder and the lowest local bidder are in fact qualified and responsive bidders. Next, OMB shall determine if the lowest local bidder meets the requirements of Section 287.087, Florida Statutes, (drug-free workplace). If the lowest local bidder meets the requirements of Section 287.087, Florida Statutes, OMB shall invite the lowest local bidder in writing to submit a matching offer to OMB which shall be submitted in writing to OMB within three (3) business days thereafter. If the lowest local bidder submits a written offer that does not fully match the lowest bid from the lowest non-local bidder tendered previously, the next lowest fully qualified local bidder will be given the opportunity to match if they are within five percent (5%). This cycle shall be repeated until there are no remaining local bidders within five percent (5%), then award shall be made to the non-local bidder. If the lowest local bidder does not respond, declines or is unable to match the lowest non-local price(s), then award will be made to the lowest overall best value bidder. If the lowest local bidder does not meet the requirement of Section 287.087, Florida Statutes, and the lowest non-local bidder does, the lowest local bidder will be disqualified and the next lowest local bidder will be considered if they are within five percent (5%); award will be made to the bidder that meets the requirements of the referenced state law. In the event a local bidder is awarded a contract pursuant to this section, all requests for change orders increasing the cost of the project must be approved by the city council. 
(e)  Preference in requests for proposals. In purchasing of, or letting of contracts for procurement of, personal property, materials, contractual services, and construction of improvements to real property or existing structures for which a request for proposals is developed with evaluation criteria, a local preference of the total score may be assigned as follows: 
Local businesses which meet all of the criteria for a local business as set forth in this section, shall be given a preference in the amount of five percent (5%) of the total score of the local business. 
(f)  Notice. Both bid documents and request for proposal documents shall include notice to vendors of the local preference policy. 
(g)  Waiver of the application of local preference. The application of local preference to a particular purchase or contract for which the city council is the awarding authority may be waived upon approval of the city council. 
(h)  Comparison of qualifications. The preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of OMB to compare quality of materials proposed for purchase and compare qualifications, character, responsibility and fitness of all persons, firms or corporations submitting bids when submitting recommendations for award to the city council. Further, the preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of the city council from giving any further preference permitted by law instead of the preferences granted herein. 
(i)  Purview and administration of this policy. OMB shall be responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining administrative procedures in support of this policy. 
(j)  Limitations. 
(1)  The provisions of this section shall apply only to procurements which are above the formal bid threshold as set forth in the City Code and the City of Port St. Lucie Purchasing Manual. 
(2)  The provisions of this section shall not apply where prohibited by federal or Florida law or where prohibited under the conditions of any grant. 
(3)  The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to any purchase exempted from the provisions of the City of Port St. Lucie Purchasing Manual. 
(4)  The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to contracts made under the Consultants Competitive Negotiation ACT (CCNA), Section 287.55, Florida Statutes. 
(5)  The provisions of this section shall not be applied to any procurement where the local nature of a business has been addressed through the scoring criteria. 
(k)  Incorporation into City of Port St. Lucie Purchasing Manual. Upon adoption, the provisions of the local preference policy and procedures shall be incorporated into the City of Port St. Lucie Purchasing Manual.

At a minimum, the Special Magistrate is obligated to be honest, unbiased, to act in good faith, to be diligent and avoid any conflict of interest including the mere appearance of a conflict of interest. The Special Magistrate must disclose any facts or circumstances that may give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality or independence. 
(d)  Term. Each Special Magistrate shall serve a term of one year. Special Magistrates may be appointed for consecutive one year terms. Special Magistrates are subject to removal, with or without cause, from their positions at any time by the City Council in its sole discretion. 
(e)  Not City employees. Special Magistrates shall not be considered city employees. However, subject to compliance with documentation required by the City Manager or his or her designee, a Special Magistrate may be compensated at a rate to be determined by the City Manager. 
(f)  Jurisdiction. Special Magistrates shall have jurisdiction over all alleged violations of the provisions of the city code of ordinances except as may otherwise be specifically provided. 
(g)  Powers. The Special Magistrate shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings consistent with the City's quasi-judicial procedures, as applicable; 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the police department of the City; 
(3)  Subpoena evidence to its hearings; 
(4)  Take testimony under oath; 
(5)  Issue orders having the force of law commanding whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(Ord. No. 01-33, § 3, passed 6-25-01; Ord. No. 08-57, § 1, passed 6-9-08; Ord. No. 10-25, § 1, passed 5-24-10; Ord. No. 17-66, § 4, 9-25-17) 
Sec. 37.05. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the Code Compliance Officer to initiate code compliance proceedings. The Special Magistrate shall not have the power to initiate compliance proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection (d), if a violation of any codes is found, the Code Compliance Officer shall notify the violator and give a reasonable time to correct the violation. The determination of a reasonable time shall be based upon considerations of fairness, practicality, ease of correction, ability to correct, severity of the violation, nature, extent and probability of danger or damage to the public, and other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period prescribed. In no event, however, should the reasonable time frame exceed a maximum of thirty (30) days. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the Code Compliance Officer shall notify the Special Magistrate and request a hearing pursuant to the procedure in section 37.06. The Special Magistrate, through the clerical staff of the City Attorney's Office, shall schedule a hearing. The violator shall be noticed of such hearing in accordance with section 37.10. 
(c)  The applicable Code Compliance Officer and the violator must attempt to meet face-to-face at a pre-hearing meeting to resolve disputes. This meeting may take the form of an informal meeting or formal mediation. Prior to the hearing, the Code Compliance Officer must provide a written certification to the Special Magistrate that he or she has attempted to resolve this dispute in good faith but was unable to. 
(d)  If the Code Compliance Officer has reason to believe a violation, or the condition causing a violation, presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the Code Compliance Officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the Special Magistrate and request a hearing on an expedited basis. 
(e)  If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the Code Compliance Officer, the case may be presented to the Special Magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(f)  If a repeat violation is found, the Code Compliance Officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The Code Compliance Officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the Special Magistrate and request a hearing. The Special Magistrate shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to section 37.10. The case may be presented to the Special Magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the Special Magistrate retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable fees upon the violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay the costs as determined by the Special Magistrate. 
(g)  If the owner of property, which is subject to a compliance proceeding before the Special Magistrate , transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial notice was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code compliance proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose to the prospective transferee, in writing, that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code compliance proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code compliance division of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and all copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer, creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(h)  Managers of rental properties may file with the Neighborhood Services Department a list of the properties they manage, along with the name and address of the person whom any courtesy notice provided under this subsection should be sent. The Neighborhood Services Department may prescribe a required format for the information, so as to best accommodate the provision of courtesy notices. Whenever a notice of violation is provided to the owner or tenant of any property, the Neighborhood Services Department shall attempt to mail a courtesy copy of the notice of violation, as well as any subsequent notice of hearing pertaining to the violation, to the name and address provided by the rental property manager. Failure to mail any courtesy copy shall not, however, affect the validity of any notice of violation, hearing or other procedure or proceeding. 
(Ord. No. 01-33, § 3, passed 6-25-01; Ord. No. 08-57, § 1, passed 6-9-08; Ord. No. 10-25, § 1, passed 5-24-10; Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 4-8-13; Ord. No. 16-09, § 1, 3-14-16; Ord. No. 17-66, § 5, 9-25-17) 
Sec. 37.06. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon request of the Code Compliance Officer, or at such other times as may be necessary, the Special Magistrate may call duly noticed hearings. The Special Magistrate shall attempt to convene no less frequently than once every month, but may convene more or less often as the demand necessitates. Minutes shall be kept of all meetings by the Special Magistrate and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The City Council shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the Special Magistrate for the proper performance of his or her duties. 
(b)  The conduct of the hearing shall be governed by the City's quasi-judicial proceedings' general procedures, as applicable. 
(c)  Each case before the Special Magistrate shall be presented by the City Attorney or his or her designee. 
(d)  The Special Magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that date. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The Special Magistrate shall take testimony from the Code Compliance Officer and the alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern these proceedings. 
(e)  At the conclusion of the hearings, the Special Magistrate shall issue an order containing findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specific date and that a fine may be imposed and that, under the conditions specified in section 37.08(a)(1), the cost of repairs and the cost of compliance may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by that date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the Special Magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A Special Magistrate hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(f)  If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the Special Magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the Special Magistrate and such costs may be included in any authorized lien. 
(Ord. No. 01-33, § 3, passed 6-25-01; Ord. No. 08-57, § 1, passed 6-9-08; Ord. No. 10-25, § 1, passed 5-24-10; Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 4-8-13; Ord. No. 16-09, § 1, 3-14-16; Ord. No. 17-66, § 6, 9-25-17) 
Sec. 37.07. - Evidence and Burden of Proof. 
(a)  All evidence shall be admitted at Special Magistrate hearings if, in the opinion of the Special Magistrate, it is the type of evidence upon which reasonable and responsible persons would normally rely in the conduct of business, regardless of the existence of any common-law or statutory rule which might make such evidence inadmissible over objections in civil actions. The Special Magistrate may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. 
(b)  Hearsay evidence may be accepted for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but such hearsay evidence shall not in and of itself be considered sufficient to support a finding or decision unless the evidence would be admissible over objections in a civil action. 
(c)  Each party to the hearing shall have the right to: 
(1)  Call and examine witnesses; 
(2)  Introduce Exhibits; 
(3)  Cross-examine opposing witnesses; 
(4)  Impeach witnesses; and 
(5)  Rebut evidence. 
(d)  At a Special Magistrate hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the City to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation did occur or does exist or has been repeated. If proper notice of hearing has been given to the violator consistent with this chapter, a hearing may proceed in the absence of the violator.

No. 07-157, § 1, adopted November 26, 2007; Ord. No. 08-57, § 1, adopted June 9, 2008; Ord. No. 10-25, § 1, adopted May 24, 2010; Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, adopted April 8, 2013 and Ord. No. 16-09, § 1, adopted March 14, 2016. 
Sec. 37.08. - Administrative fines; liens; duration of liens; collection. 
(a)  (1)  The Special Magistrate, upon notification by the Code Compliance Officer that a previous order of the Special Magistrate has not been complied with by the set time, or that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the Special Magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the Code Compliance Officer. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 37.05(d), the Special Magistrate shall notify the City Council, which may make all reasonable repairs required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs and cost of compliance along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. The city, having a population greater than 50,000, determines that a fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $1,000.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $5,000.00 per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may include all cost of repairs and all costs incurred for enforcement of the Code. However, if the Special Magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed $15,000.00 per violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, pursuant to this section, the Special Magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  a.  The Special Magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
b.  The Special Magistrate may modify or partially release liens according to the following application guidelines. 
1.  Application for modification must be made by the violator or owner of the violating property. 
2.  Payment in the amount of $350.00 must be made with the application. 
3.  The violation must be cured, and no other violation may be present. 
4.  Partial release of lien against a non-offending property will be decided by the Special Magistrate upon application and in the event granted, shall include a provision that administrative and hard costs attributed to the offending property be paid by the applicant. 
5.  The prior modifications and releases issued by the Special Magistrate (and previously existing code enforcement board) are hereby approved and ratified. 
(4)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine or a fine plus repair and administrative costs shall be recorded in the public records of St. Lucie County and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator, and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. Such lien shall accrue interest at the rate determined by the Chief Financial Officer of the State of Florida, pursuant to Section 55.03, Florida Statutes. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three months from the filing of any lien, which remains unpaid, the Special Magistrate shall authorize the City Attorney to foreclose the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Article X, Section 4 of the State Constitution. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city council and the city council may execute a release of any lien pursuant to this section. 
(5)  The City of Port St. Lucie City Manager or his designee shall have the authority to assign liens to a private third party for collection at its discretion, provided its contract with said third party provides the following: 
a.  The city shall retain the power to decide which liens to assign; 
b.  The city shall retain the power to decide what collection techniques are permissible and to prohibit use of any technique it finds objectionable; 
c.  The city shall retain the power to take back any assigned debt or lien; and 
d.  The city shall retain the power to terminate the contract for any or no reason. 
(b)  No lien provided under this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless, within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including reasonable attorney fees. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers of valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. The city council shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien.

ARTICLE III. - ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE OF PENALTIES 

Sec. 37.20. - Citations; notices to appear; penalties. 
(a)  A Code Compliance Officer is authorized to issue a citation or notice to appear to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the Code Compliance Officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance and that the St. Lucie County Court will hear the charge at a specified date and time. A notice to appear means a written order issued by a Code Compliance Officer in lieu of physical arrest. 
(b)  Prior to issuing a citation or notice to appear, a Code Compliance Officer or other regulatory agencies as may be appropriate shall provide notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of a code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a Code Compliance Officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, a Code Compliance Officer may issue a citation or notice to appear to the person who has committed the violation. If a repeat violation is found or if the Code Compliance Officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible, or that the violator is engaged in violation of an itinerant or transient nature within the jurisdiction while moving from place to place, a Code Compliance Officer does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation and may immediately issue a citation or notice to appear. 
(c)  A citation or notice to appear issued by a Code Compliance Officer shall be in a form prescribed by the City Council and shall contain: 
(1)  The date and time of issuance.

(9)  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(10)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(d)  After issuing a citation or notice to appear to an alleged violator, a Code Compliance Officer shall deposit the original citation or notice to appear and one copy of the citation or notice to appear with the St. Lucie County Court. 
(e)  Any person who is issued a citation by a Code Compliance Officer may contest the citation by appearing in the St. Lucie County Court at the date and time specified in the citation and advising the court that they wish to contest the citation and request a hearing on the matter. A hearing shall then take place at a time set by the court to provide the city and the person, to whom the citation was issued, an opportunity to present evidence concerning the violation to the court. 
(f)  Penalties. A violation of a code or an ordinance enforced pursuant to such section is a civil infraction. The maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $500.00.

If a person issued a notice to appear under this section refuses to sign such notice, the Code Compliance Officer has no authority to arrest such person. 
(i)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to the enforcement pursuant to Sections 553.79 and 553.80, Florida Statutes, of building codes adopted pursuant to Section 553.73, Florida Statutes, as they apply to construction, provided that a building permit is either not required or has been issued by the city. For purposes of this chapter, building codes means only those codes adopted pursuant to Section 553.73, Florida Statutes. 
(j)  The provisions of this section are an additional and supplemental means of enforcing a code or ordinance. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the special magistrate from enforcing a code or ordinance by any other means.

TITLE IV - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE 
CHAPTER 40. - NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROGRAM 
Article I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 40.01. - Authority. 
    The City of Port St. Lucie, acting through the city council and/or its designee(s), shall have authority pursuant to home rule and police powers under Article VIII, section 2, of the Florida Constitution to determine and declare the existence of a public nuisance and shall have the authority to provide for the abatement of same. Abatement of such nuisances constitutes a municipal service, which specifically benefits the property upon which the nuisance is abated and all costs incurred by the city in abating such nuisances shall be levied as a special assessment pursuant to section 170.201, Florida Statutes and/or all other applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.02. - City council findings. 
    The city council finds that conditions exist within the City of Port St. Lucie, which violate public rights, subvert public order, decency, or morals, or cause inconvenience or damage to the public generally. Specifically, the accumulation of underbrush, weeds, rubbish, trash, and grass on improved property; the existence of unsafe dwellings and other structures on improved property; and the creation of pools, ponds, other bodies of water, or conditions which endanger the public health, welfare, property value, or safety of the community, has become an ever increasing menace in the city and constitutes a nuisance. It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to create a nuisance, or suffer or permit a nuisance to exist, upon property, which is under his, her, or its care, custody or control. 
    The city acting at the direction of the city council shall have the authority to and shall take steps to ensure the abatement of public nuisances in the most aggressive manner provided by the Port St. Lucie City Code or state law. The abatement of such nuisances protects the public health, safety and welfare, enhances the value of the property, involves the furnishing of vital municipal services, and specifically benefits the property on which the nuisance is abated. The cost of any abatement, including administrative fees and costs, shall constitute a special assessment upon the benefited property. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.03. - Public nuisance abatement program established. 
    There is hereby established a City of Port St. Lucie Nuisance Abatement Program for the purpose of abating the public nuisances defined in section 40.05 in this chapter. The owner of any property located within the City of Port St. Lucie who creates, suffers, or permits a nuisance to exist upon his or her property, shall be responsible for abating the nuisance and, if the owner fails to abate the nuisance in accordance with the notice given pursuant to this chapter, the city may abate the nuisance and the city shall be reimbursed for the costs associated with the abatement pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for the recovery of those costs. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.04. - Public nuisance abatement program trust fund established. 
    There is hereby established an interest bearing public nuisance abatement program trust fund for the deposit, maintenance, and distribution of any assessment funds collected or expended as a result of the public nuisance abatement program. The assessment imposed on a benefited property and collected by the city shall include the actual cost of abating the nuisance, the cost of serving notice, the cost of obtaining title information, the cost of lien recordation, the cost of inspections, and all other specifically related costs. Any funds in the trust fund may be used to abate public nuisances on property to which title is not clear, abate nuisances on government property, which may not be assessed, or for other purposes directly related to the abatement of nuisances. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.05. - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:

(4)  Any "attractive nuisance" or condition which may prove detrimental to the health and safety of children, whether on an improved or unimproved lot, tract or parcel of land including, but not limited to, abandoned wells, shafts, excavations, abandoned appliances, abandoned or inoperable motor vehicles, and any structurally unsound fences or structure, lumber, trash, debris, or vegetation such as poison ivy, oak, or sumac, which may prove a hazard for inquisitive minors. 
(5)  Any unfit, unsanitary, abandoned, or unsafe dwelling, structure, or improvement upon real property. 
(6)  Any underbrush, weeds, or untended grass which exceeds two feet in height located on improved property. 
(7)  The carcasses of animals or fowl not disposed of within a reasonable time after death. 
(8)  The pollution of any public well or cistern, stream, lake, canal or body of water by sewage, dead animals, industrial wastes, or other substances. 
(9)  Any building, structure or other place or location where any activity in violation of local, state, or federal law is conducted, performed, or maintained, and which under the facts and circumstances surrounding the activity constitutes a public nuisance in fact. 
(10)  Any accumulation of stagnant water or sewage permitted or maintained on any improved lot, premises, or piece of ground. 
(11)  Dense smoke, noxious fumes, gas, soot or cinders, in unreasonable quantities. 
(12)  Unsheltered storage for a period of 30 days or more within the corporate limits of this city (except in licensed junkyards) of old and unused stripped junk and other automobiles not in good and safe operating condition; and of any other vehicles, machinery, implements, or equipment or personal property of any kind which is no longer safely usable for the purposes for which it was manufactured, is hereby declared to be a nuisance and a danger to public health, safety and welfare. 
(13)  For the purpose of this article, the term "nuisance" shall also include any condition or use of premises or of building exteriors which is detrimental to the property of others or which causes or tends to cause substantial diminution in the value of other property in the neighborhood in which the premises are located. 
(14)  Such other acts or conditions which are determined and declared by other ordinances or by resolution of city council to be or constitute public nuisances. 
    Nuisance inspector shall mean the city manager or the designee thereof.

(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.06. - Nuisance abatement program: supplemental means of enforcement. 
(1)  Pursuant to F.S. §§ 162.13 and 166.0415(7), the nuisance abatement program is a supplemental means of enforcing city codes and ordinances. A public nuisance also constitutes a code violation and the city is not limited to a choice of remedy to ensure compliance with its codes. Code compliance proceedings are punitive and involve fines levied against the subject property, which may be collected pursuant to F.S. § 162.09. In contrast, nuisance abatement pursuant to this chapter is remedial in nature and specifically designed to immediately, or as soon as practicable, bring the property into compliance, thereby protecting the public welfare and directly improving and benefiting the property upon which the nuisance is abated. 
(2)  In addition to nuisance abatement proceedings, the city may institute code compliance proceedings against a property for an occurrence of a violation. However, once the subject violation/nuisance is abated, that occurrence of the code violation has ceased and no further code compliance penalties may accrue for that specific occurrence. 
(3)  Repeat nuisance violations. Following the first notice under this chapter to abate a nuisance as described herein, any subsequent violation of the same nuisance classification(s) on the same property within a 12-month period may be abated by the city without further notice so long as the initial notice and order of abatement specifically provides for such subsequent abatement therein. All costs of abating the repeat nuisance, including administrative fees and costs, shall constitute a special assessment against said property. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07; Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 4-8-13) 
Sec. 40.07. - Powers and duties of the nuisance inspector. 
(1)  The nuisance abatement coordinator and/or his/her designees (i.e. code compliance personnel) shall be charged with the duty of administering the applicable standards and reporting non-compliance therewith and in furtherance of this responsibility, the nuisance abatement coordinator and/or designees shall make such inspections, compile such facts and evidence, and prepare such reports as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes and intent of this chapter. The nuisance abatement coordinator's findings, evidence and reports shall be promptly forwarded to the city attorney's office for review. 
(2)  The nuisance abatement coordinator and his or her designees are hereby authorized to enter upon private property in order to enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall be immune from all civil and criminal liability while under the discharge of duties imposed herein. When necessary to obtain such entry, the nuisance abatement coordinator may institute appropriate proceedings to obtain a warrant. 
(3)  In the case of an obvious unfit and unsafe dwelling, structure, or other condition which after inspection is determined to be uninhabited, the nuisance abatement coordinator shall cause to be posted a "No Trespassing" sign in an attempt to warn third parties who might be exposed to the risk of danger created by the unsafe condition. However, the City of Port St. Lucie does not assume any liability for harm to third parties caused by the unfit and unsafe dwelling, structure, or condition under any circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07; Ord. No. 09-49, § 1, 6-8-09; Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 4-8-13) 
Sec. 40.08. - Nuisance abatement board. 
    The city acting at the direction of the city council specifically reserves the right to create a nuisance abatement board, which shall be authorized to hear and review nuisance cases, determine the existence of a nuisance pursuant to City Code, and provide notice and order abatement of same. The membership and qualifications of such board shall be determined by city council. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.09-40.15. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - NUISANCE ABATEMENT PROCEDURE 

Sec. 40.16. - Publication of annual notice. 
    The city council shall cause to be published in a newspaper regularly published and in general circulation within the City once a week for two consecutive weeks during the month of October each year hereafter a notice reading substantially as follows: 
"ATTENTION OWNERS, AGENTS, CUSTODIANS, LESSEES AND OCCUPANTS OF REAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF THE CITY OF PORT ST. LUCIE: 
    You are hereby notified that you are required by law to cut and prevent the excessive accumulation of weeds, underbrush, grass or other dead and living plant life upon your improved property; to remove any trash, debris, refuse, inoperable or abandoned vehicles or appliances, or other nocuous matter located on any property owned, controlled or occupied by you in the City of Port St. Lucie; and also to repair, restore or demolish any unfit or unsafe structure located upon such property; and that upon your failure to do so, the City of Port St. Lucie will institute nuisance abatement proceedings against your property and cause such nuisance to be abated. The cost of such abatement will constitute a special assessment lien against the property on which the nuisance is located. Such special assessment lien shall be coequal with the lien of all state, county, district, and municipal taxes and superior in dignity to mortgages and all other liens, irrespective of the date of the recording of the municipal lien or the date of the recording of any mortgage or any other lien on real property. A failure to pay said lien, even such lien upon homestead property, may result in a loss of title to your property." 
    A failure to publish this notice as provided for herein shall not invalidate any nuisance abatement proceedings brought pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 07-146, § 3, 10-22-07) 
Sec. 40.17. - Resolution declaring property a threat and order to show cause. 
(1)  Upon receipt of the nuisance inspector's findings, evidence, and reports supporting the existence of a nuisance as defined herein, the city attorney, or his or her designee, shall review and determine the sufficiency therewith. If the facts and circumstances support a finding of a public nuisance, the city attorney or his or her designee, shall prepare a resolution for the city council declaring the property a threat to the public, health, safety and welfare with order to show cause.

(1)  Pursuant to article VIII, section 2, Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041, the council has all powers of local self-government to perform city functions and to render city services except when prohibited by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances and resolutions. 
(2)  In addition to its powers of self-government, the council is specifically authorized by F.S. § 170.201, to impose solid waste service assessments in all or a portion of the incorporated area. Additionally, the council derives authority to impose solid waste service assessments within the municipality from the home rule power of cities in article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution and F.S. § 166.021. 
(3)  This article authorizes the imposition of solid waste service assessments throughout the solid waste services assessment area created in an initial assessment resolution or preliminary rate resolution adopted pursuant to this article. Additionally and alternatively, this article authorizes the imposition of a solid waste service assessment throughout a geographic area designated by the council in an initial assessment resolution or a preliminary rate resolution. 
(4)  The purpose of this article is to: 
(i)  Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of annual solid waste service assessments under the general home rule powers of the city; 
(ii)  Authorize a procedure for the funding of solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal and recycling services, facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city; and 
(iii)  Legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the provision of solid waste collection and disposal services by the city. 
(5)  The existence of any building or other improvement on improved property results in such property generating solid waste or being capable of generating solid waste. 
(6)  Whether imposed throughout the entire city or a portion thereof, the imposition of a recurring annual solid waste service assessment is an alternative, equitable and efficient method to fairly and reasonably apportion and recover the solid waste management and disposal costs experienced by the city among the parcels of residential property within the area assessed. 
(7)  The use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act provides a mechanism to equitably and efficiently collect solid waste service assessments, as well as address payment delinquencies and recover unpaid fees, charges, or assessments advanced for solid waste management and disposal services, programs, and facilities allocable to specific parcels of assessed property. 
(8)  The annual solid waste service assessments to be imposed pursuant to this article shall constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(9)  The solid waste service assessment to be imposed using the procedures provided in this article is imposed by the council, not the clerk, property appraiser, or tax collector. The duties of the clerk, property appraiser, or tax collector under the provisions of this article and the Uniform Assessment Collection Act are ministerial. 
(d)  Legislative determinations of special benefit. It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that the solid waste services, facilities, and programs of the city provide a special benefit to improved property within the city based upon the following legislative determinations: 
(1)  Recycling activities associated with recyclable materials and solid waste collection and disposal services, facilities, and programs furnished by the city benefit assessed properties by providing: 
(i)  Disposal services, facilities, and programs that promote the health and safety of inhabitants as a result of proper, safe, and cost effective disposal of solid waste generated on such property; 
(ii)  Better service to residents, including owners and tenants; 
(iii)  The enhancement of environmentally responsible use and enjoyment of improved property; 
(iv)  The protection of property values as a result of the uniform availability, delivery, and payment for such services, facilities, and programs; and 
(v)  Providing the lowest cost of solid waste and recyclable materials disposal to residents of assessed property by ensuring that all share in the cost and the assessment is collected in a timely manner. 
(2)  The provision of comprehensive recycling activities associated with recyclable materials and solid waste collection and disposal services and programs furnished by or through the city to improved property promotes, enhances, and ensures the full use and enjoyment of improved property within the entire city. 
(Ord. 07-79, § 11, passed 6-25-07) 
Sec. 50.21. - Annual solid waste collection and disposal assessments. 
(a)  General authority. 
(1)  The council is hereby authorized to impose an annual solid waste service assessment upon assessed property to fund all or any portion of the solid waste cost at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal, and recycling services, facilities, or programs. All solid waste service assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this article. 
(2)  The amount of the solid waste service assessment imposed in a fiscal year against a parcel of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of property designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the solid waste cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal, and recycling services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. 
(3)  Any unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for solid waste management and disposal services or facilities which are allocable to specific parcels of assessed property may be included in the annual solid waste service assessment for such parcels. In such an event, any existing lien on each affected parcel for unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments shall be supplanted by the lien resulting from the inclusion of such unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments in the amount of the solid waste service assessment. 
(b)  Initial proceedings. 
(1)  The initial proceeding for the imposition of a solid waste service assessment shall be the adoption of an initial assessment resolution by the council: 
(i)  Containing a brief and general description of the solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal, and recycling services, facilities, or programs to be provided; 
(ii)  Determining the solid waste cost to be assessed; 
(iii)  Describing the method of apportioning the solid waste cost and the computation of the solid waste service assessment for specific properties; 
(iv)  Providing a summary description of the parcels of property (conforming to the description contained on the tax roll) located within the city that receive a special benefit from the provision of solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal, and recycling services, facilities, or programs or describing a specific geographic area in which such service, facility, or program will be provided;

(iii)  The amount of the solid waste service assessment to be imposed against each such parcel of assessed property. 
(2)  The initial assessment roll shall be retained by the city manager and shall be open to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed form if the amount of the solid waste service assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a computer terminal available to the public. 
(d)  Notice by publication. Upon completion of the initial assessment roll, the city manager shall publish, or direct the publication of, once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, a notice stating that at a meeting of the council on a certain day and hour, not earlier than twenty (20) calendar days from such publication, which meeting shall be a regular, adjourned, or special meeting, will be held at which the council will hear objections of all interested persons to the final assessment resolution establishing the rate of assessment and approving the aforementioned initial assessment roll. The published notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such notice shall include: 
(1)  A geographic depiction of the property subject to the solid waste service assessment; 
(2)  A brief and general description of the solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal and recycling services, facilities, or programs to be provided;

(e)  Notice by mail. In addition to the published notice required by subsection 50.21(d), the city manager shall provide notice, or direct the provision of notice, of the proposed solid waste service assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the solid waste service assessment. Such notice shall include: 
(1)  The purpose of the solid waste service assessment; 
(2)  The rate of assessment to be levied against each parcel of property; 
(3)  The unit of measurement applied to determine the solid waste service assessment; 
(4)  The number of such units contained in each parcel of property; 
(5)  The total revenue to be collected by the city from the solid waste service assessment; 
(6)  A statement that failure to pay the solid waste service assessment will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the property or foreclosure proceedings to be instituted, either of which may result in a loss of title to the property; 
(7)  Notification that unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for solid waste and recyclable materials management and disposal services allocable to specific parcels will be additionally included in the solid waste service assessment; 
(8)  A statement that all affected owners have a right to appear at the hearing and to file written objections with the council within 20 days of the notice; and 
(9)  The date, time, and place of the hearing. 
The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Notice shall be mailed at least 20 calendar days prior to the hearing to each owner at such address as is shown on the tax roll. Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the United States Postal Service. The city manager may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the owner to receive such notice, due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll or release or discharge any obligation for payment of a solid waste service assessment imposed by the council pursuant to this article. 
(f)  Adoption of final assessment resolution. At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the council, the council shall receive any written objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the council adopt the final assessment resolution which shall: 
(1)  Confirm, modify, or repeal the initial assessment resolution with such amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the council; 
(2)  Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; 
(3)  Approve the inclusion of any unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for solid waste and recyclable materials management and disposal services; 
(4)  Approve the initial assessment roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and 
(5)  Determine the method of collection. 
The adoption of the final assessment resolution by the council shall constitute a legislative determination that all parcels assessed derive a special benefit from the solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal and recycling services, facilities, or programs to be provided and a legislative determination that the solid waste service assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the special benefit. All objections to the final assessment resolution shall be made in writing, and filed with the city manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual rate resolution for the initial fiscal year in which solid waste service assessments are imposed or reimposed hereunder. 
(g)  Effect of final assessment resolution. The solid waste service assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the initial rate of assessment, the initial assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the solid waste service assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the council action on the final assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in subsection 50.22(b) hereof is used to collect the solid waste service assessments, such other official as the council by resolution shall designate. 
(h)  Adoption of annual rate resolution. 
(1)  The council shall adopt an annual rate resolution during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which a solid waste service assessment is imposed hereunder. 
(2)  The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate resolution by the council: 
(i)  Containing a brief and general description of the solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal and recycling services, facilities, or programs to be provided; 
(ii)  Determining the solid waste cost to be assessed for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(iii)  Establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(iv)  Authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to receive and consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of the annual rate resolution for the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(v)  Directing the city manager to: 
a.  Update the assessment roll; 
b.  Provide notice by publication and first class mail to affected owners in the event circumstances described in subsection (6) of this subsection so require; and 
c.  Direct and authorize any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the city. 
(3)  The annual rate resolution shall: 
(i)  Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(ii)  Approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the council deems just and right. 
The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent preliminary rate resolution, together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall preclude the council from providing annual notification to all owners of assessed property in the manner provided in either or both subsections 50.21(d) or 50.21(e) hereof. 
(5)  Nothing herein shall preclude the council from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to subsections 50.21(d) and 50.21(e) hereof. 
(6)  In the event: 
(i)  The proposed solid waste service assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the council and included in the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 50.21(d) and 50.21(e) hereof; 
(ii)  The purpose for which the solid waste service assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the solid waste service assessment is substantially changed from that represented by the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 50.21(d) and 50.21(e) hereof; 
(iii)  Assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased solid waste service assessment from that represented by the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 50.21(d) and 50.21(e) hereof; or 
(iv)  An assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year; 
Notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed property. Such notice shall substantially conform to the notice requirements set forth in subsections 50.21(d) and 50.21(e) hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice, due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll or release or discharge any obligation for payment of a solid waste service assessment imposed by the council pursuant to this article. 
(7)  As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the final assessment resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the solid waste service assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the council action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any prior fee, charge, or assessment imposed by the city or any solid waste service assessment not challenged within the required 20-day period for those solid waste service assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(8)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in subsection 50.22(b) hereof is used to collect the solid waste service assessments, such other official as the council by resolution shall designate. If the solid waste service assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by any court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll. 
(i)  Lien of solid waste service assessments. Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all solid waste service assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims until paid. The lien for a solid waste service assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the council of the final assessment resolution of the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a solid waste service assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection method shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a solid waste service assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 50.22(b) shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the council of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(j)  Revisions to solid waste service assessments. If any solid waste service assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the council is satisfied that any such solid waste service assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the council has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the council may take all necessary steps to impose a new solid waste service assessment against any property benefited by the solid waste costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second solid waste service assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the council may obtain and impose other solid waste service assessments until a valid solid waste service assessment is imposed. 
(k)  Procedural irregularities. Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any solid waste service assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any solid waste service assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such solid waste service assessment was duly levied, that the solid waste service assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such solid waste service assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any party objecting to a solid waste service assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(l)  Correction of errors and omissions. 
(1)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, council, or their deputies, employees, or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a solid waste service assessment imposed by the council under the provision of this article. 
(2)  When it shall appear that any solid waste service assessment should have been imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of solid waste and recyclable materials collection, disposal and recycling services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the council may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted parcel in the manner and form provided in subsection 50.21(e), impose the applicable solid waste service assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable solid waste service assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such solid waste service assessment shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in section 50.22 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(3)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a solid waste service assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the solid waste service assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the solid waste service assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(4)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(m)  Interim assessments. The council is hereby authorized to impose and the contractor is hereby authorized to collect an interim solid waste service assessment against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim solid waste service assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. The contractor shall be responsible for billing and collecting this prorated assessment prior to the preparation of the subsequent tax roll. A failure of the property owner to pay the interim assessment prior to the preparation of the subsequent tax roll shall not relieve the owner of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim solid waste service assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Pursuant to this chapter, any unpaid interim assessment not collected prior to the preparation of the subsequent tax roll shall be imposed and included on the subsequent tax roll. 
(Ord. 07-79, § 11, passed 6-25-07; Am. Ord. 07-158, § 2, passed 11-26-07) 
Sec. 50.22. - Collection and use of solid waste service assessments. 
(a)  Method of collection. 
(1)  Unless otherwise directed by the council, the solid waste service assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(2)  The amount of a solid waste service assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefited property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(i)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(ii)  Notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and 
(iii)  Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such solid waste service assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(b)  Alternative method of collection. In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city may elect to collect the solid waste service assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this subsection: 
(1)  The city shall provide solid waste service assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(i)  A brief explanation of the solid waste service assessment; 
(ii)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the solid waste service assessment; 
(iii)  The number of units contained within the parcel; 
(iv)  The total amount of the solid waste service assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period; 
(v)  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
(vi)  The date on which the solid waste service assessment is due; and 
(vii)  A statement that the solid waste service assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the solid waste service assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent solid waste service assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A solid waste service assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date any installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her solid waste service assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will either: 
(i)  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent solid waste service assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
(ii)  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent solid waste service assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city or its agent may join in one (1) foreclosure action the collection of solid waste service assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, in collection of such delinquent solid waste service assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent solid waste service assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent solid waste service assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
(i)  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article; and 
(ii)  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent solid waste service assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the city's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or her or other city officials in subsection 50.21(I) hereof. 
(7)  Any council action required in the collection of solid waste service assessments may be by resolution. 
(c)  Government property. 
(1)  If solid waste service assessments are imposed against government property, the city shall provide solid waste service assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(i)  A brief explanation of the solid waste service assessment; 
(ii)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the solid waste service assessment; 
(iii)  The number of units contained within the parcel; 
(iv)  The total amount of the parcel's solid waste service assessment for the appropriate period; 
(v)  The location at which payment will be accepted; and 
(vi)  The date on which the solid waste service assessment is due. 
(2)  Solid waste service assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other solid waste service assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(3)  A solid waste service assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its solid waste service assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, in collection of such delinquent solid waste service assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent solid waste service assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a solid waste service assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The council may contract for such billing services as necessary with any utility, whether or not such utility is owned by the city. 
(Ord. 07-79, § 11, passed 6-25-07) 
Sec. 50.23. - General provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. This article and the city's authority to impose assessments pursuant hereto shall be applicable throughout the city. 
(b)  Alternative method. 
(1)  This article shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter come into existence. This article, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of the city, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof.

Sec. 51.04. - Stormwater fee; imposition and calculation of. 
(a)  Imposition. A stormwater fee is hereby imposed upon all property within the city unless otherwise exempted, for services and facilities provided by the stormwater management system. For purposes of imposing the stormwater fee, the city has obtained the services of a consulting engineer to develop the statistical rationale for providing just and equitable rates, fees, and charges for the facilities and services provided by the system. 
(b)  Application and classification. 
(1)  Developed single family residential property. Each dwelling unit shall be billed at a flat fee in the amount of $102.10. This rate shall also constitute the base rate for an E.R.U. for purposes of calculating nonresidential rates. 
(2)  Undeveloped single family residential property. Each undeveloped single family lot shall be billed at the flat fee for one equivalent residential unit multiplied by a correction factor of 0.75. 
(3)  Undeveloped parcels. Each undeveloped parcel shall be billed at a rate determined by dividing the total land area of the properties, in square feet, by the calculated impervious area of an E.R.U., multiplied by a correction factor of 0.15 to arrive at the number of E.R.U.'s for that parcel. 
(4)  Developed nonresidential property. 
a.  Developed nonresidential property shall be billed for the developed and undeveloped portion of the parcel up to the maximum permissible impervious percentage allowed by the zoning codes. The following formula will apply: 
(A) = total area (sq. ft.) 
(B) = impervious surface (sq. ft.) 
(C) = calculated impervious area of an E.R.U. (2,280 sq. ft.) 
(D) = 0.15 multiplication factor 
(E) = 1.25 (1.25 = 1/0.80 where 80 percent is the maximum permissible impervious area of a parcel) 
TOTAL E.R.U.'s = developed E.R.U.'s + undeveloped E.R.U.'s = ((B)/(C)) + (((A) - ((B) × (E)))/(C)) × (D) 
b.  A credit shall be given for constructed retention facilities pursuant to South Florida Water Management District requirements. 
(5)  Exempt property. The following shall be exempt property and not subject to a stormwater fee: 
a.  Common areas within multi-family areas. 
b.  Property which, because of its environmentally sensitive character, cannot be developed under present environmental protection regulations. 
c.  Publicly owned road and drainage right-of-way.

(2)  One equivalent residential unit (ERC) shall, for purposes of this section, have an assigned value of 1.00. 
(3)  For wastewater service capacity, one ERC is hereby established and determined to be equal to a flow of 250 gallons of water per day, average annual basis (250 GPD). 
(4)  For water service capacity, one ERC is hereby established and determined to be equal to a flow of 250 gallons per day, average annual basis (250 GPD). 
(5)  The "total equivalent residential unit value" for an establishment may be calculated by multiplying the ERC factor listed above by the number of units, and shall be rounded up to the nearest 0.1 ERC factor. 
(6)  There shall not be less than one ERC reserved for any and all establishments, users or customers that will use metered water or wastewater services of the city. 
(7)  For all establishments not listed above, the total equivalent residential unit (ERC) value for service capacity shall be determined by using the following formula: 
Total ERC Value = Number of Fixed Units / 20 
(8)  Historical flows. The city may accept, for other than single-family residences, metered water use data from similar establishments in lieu of flow estimates based on the ERC factors set forth in subsections (d)(1), (5), or (6). Historical water use data from the city's own billing records will supersede any data submitted from another water or wastewater utility provider. The use of this flow calculation method shall require: 
a.  Submittal of copies of the most recent 12 consecutive months of water bills from comparable servicing utilities for a minimum of six separate similar establishments. 
i.  Similar establishments shall be considered those that are alike or similar in size, located in a similar geographic environment, and that operate a similar number of days per week and hours per day. 
ii.  Similar establishment metered flow values may not be considered reliable indicators of typical water use where one or more of the establishments utilized in the sample has exceeded the monthly flow average for all six establishments by more than 25 percent or where the different establishments demonstrate wide variations in monthly flow totals. 
b.  Food operations electing to utilize this method shall require submittal of copies of the most recent 24 months of water bills from comparable servicing utilities for a minimum of six separate similar establishments. 
c.  When metered water use data is accepted by the city in lieu of flow estimates based on the ERC factors set forth in subsections (f)(1), (5), or (6), the highest flow that occurred in any month for any of the six similar establishments shall be used for system sizing and plant capacity reservation and line charges if line charges are applicable to the subject property. 
(9)  The above ERC schedule applies to establishments being connected to the city water and wastewater. 
(10)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city reserves the right to review and monitor actual flows, as compared to flows expected to be generated by the calculated ERC value, and upon which capital charges were calculated and paid to the city. For purposes of an accurate review, such monitoring will cover flows generated during three consecutive peak months occurring during the previous six-month period. If actual flows exceed expected flows by ten percent or more, the customer shall promptly pay such additional capital charges for such excess flow as shall be required by the city. 
(g)  Capital improvement funds; establishment; expenditure guide-lines; application and pledge to revenue bonds. 
(1)  The water capital charges collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into a fund called the Port St. Lucie Water System Capital Improvement Fund and the wastewater capital charges shall likewise be deposited into a fund called the Port St. Lucie Wastewater System Capital Improvement Fund. The water capital charges so deposited shall be used only for capital expenditures and the payment of city indebtedness associated with the expansion of the city's water supply, and water treatment systems and all components thereof and additions thereto, in order to provide additional water treatment capacity or water service capacity to those new customers who connect to the city's water system.

Sec. 61.15. - Guaranteed revenue fee; adoption; applicability; calculation; time of payment; forfeiture; withholding service. 
(a)  Adoption. The city council hereby adopts, pursuant to general law, a guaranteed revenue fee which shall be paid for each water and/or wastewater ERC as purchased and reserved in any non-single family residential utility service agreement executed with the city. Each utility service agreement shall be deemed to provide by its terms, as if fully set forth therein for the payment of such guaranteed revenue. 
(b)  Calculation and time of payment. 
(1)  Applicable to non-single family residential utility service agreements executed prior to February 1, 2019. The guaranteed revenue fee shall be due and payable upon execution of any non-single family residential water and/or wastewater utility service agreement, based upon the number of full months remaining until the end of the calendar year, commencing with the month following the month the agreement is issued by the city to the applicant. Guaranteed revenue shall be due and payable again within thirty days of receipt of an annual invoice for each calendar year thereafter for any agreement reserving water and/or wastewater capacity, to the extent that there are any reserved, but unconnected ERCs, and the fee shall be based on the base facility charge of the city. If any payment of guaranteed revenue fees is more than thirty days late, the city shall send a notice of delinquency to the last known address kept on file with the city for its mailing of any notices, billings or invoices to the applicant concerning the provision of utility services to the applicant's real property. Applicant shall submit the required full payment of guaranteed revenue fees to the city within thirty days of receipt of the written notice of delinquency. If any ERCs are connected during a calendar year for which guaranteed revenue was paid, a credit will be issued for those ERCs on the next scheduled annual invoice date. 
(2)  Applicable to non-single family residential utility service agreements executed on or after February 1, 2019. The guaranteed revenue fee shall be due and payable the first monthly billing cycle occurring after execution of any non-single family residential water and/or wastewater utility service agreement. Guaranteed revenue shall be due and payable again each month thereafter for any agreement reserving water and/or wastewater capacity, to the extent that there are any reserved, but unconnected ERCs, and the fee shall be based on the non-residential base facility charge of the city.

Applicant shall submit the required full payment of guaranteed revenue fees to the city within twenty days of receipt of the written notice of delinquency. 
(c)  Forfeiture. The continued reservation of ERCs for the water and/or wastewater systems that run with the real property shall be dependent upon the timely payment of guaranteed revenue fees as set forth above. The utility service agreement shall be deemed to provide that failure to timely submit the required full payment of guaranteed revenue fees to the city after written notice of delinquency, shall be a default in the payment of, or renewal of, guaranteed revenue fees. Said default shall be considered a default by the applicant and its successors or assigns and shall result in the forfeiture of any and all remaining reserved capacity and any associated fees paid for such capacity. 
(d)  Withholding service. The city shall withhold water and/or wastewater service to be rendered under a utility service agreement until all guaranteed revenue fees that are due to the city under the agreement have been paid in full.

Sec. 63.25. - Miscellaneous policies. 
(a)  General utility systems policies. 
1.  Availability: "Available," for the purposes of this Chapter as applied to the City's water and wastewater systems, means that the City's system is capable of being connected to the plumbing of an establishment or residence, is not under a Department of Environmental Protection moratorium, and has adequate permitted capacity to provide the potable water and/or wastewater demand by the residence or establishment; and: 
a.  For a residential subdivision lot, or a single-family residence, a potable water main or wastewater main exists in a public easement or right-of-way that abuts the property line of the lot, residence, or establishment; or 
b.  For an establishment or multi-family residential project, a potable water main or wastewater main exists in a public easement or right-of-way that abuts the property of the establishment or is within 50 feet of the property line of the establishment as accessed via existing easements or rights-of-way; or 
c.  For proposed residential subdivisions with more than 30 lots, or proposed commercial subdivisions with more than 7500 gallons per day of potable water demand, and for areas zoned or used for an industrial or manufacturing purpose or its equivalent, a potable water main or wastewater main exists within 1,320 feet of the development as measured and accessed via existing easements or rights-of-way; or 
d.  For repairs or modifications within areas zoned or used for an industrial or manufacturing purpose or its equivalent, a potable water main or wastewater main exists within 500 feet of an establishment's or residence's property boundary as measured and accessed via existing easements or rights-of-way. 
2.  Connections to the Utility system. 
a.  New construction: All new construction of any type must connect to the water and/or wastewater services of the City if the property on which such new construction takes place is adjacent to a public right-of-way or easement in which a water main or sanitary sewer is located. 
b.  Required connections: If a water main is adjacent or available to a property, and a residential building, commercial or industrial building, or other structure located on that property is connected to a private well system, then that residential building, commercial or industrial building, or other structure will be required to be connected to the City's water system when the private well system fails, becomes contaminated or experiences a dry well condition or a permit is requested from the St. Lucie County Health Department or other appropriate authority for a replacement well. If a sanitary sewer is adjacent or available to a property, and a residential building, commercial or industrial building, or other structure located on that property is connected to a septic tank system, then that residential building, commercial or industrial building, or other structure will be required to be connected to the City's wastewater system when the septic tank fails or a permit is requested from the St. Lucie County Health Department or other appropriate authority for a septic tank or drainfield replacement. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the existence of a health or safety hazard, which may be eliminated by connection to City's water and/or wastewater systems is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. The owner of any building or structure impacted thereby shall be required to immediately abate the said public nuisance and to connect to the City's water and/or wastewater system. 
c.  Irrigation Wells: Any property which is currently utilizing a well for irrigation purposes shall be able to continue to utilize such well notwithstanding existing or future connection to the City's water system. No cross connection between potable and nonpotable systems will be allowed. 
d.  Must maintain connections to City's system: Once a property has connected to the City's water and/or wastewater system, the property shall not be permitted to disconnect from the City's systems to return to a well for potable water or a septic system for wastewater disposal. However, as noted in Section 63.25 (a) (2) (c) , a well may be used for irrigation purposes. 
(b)  Policies applicable to special assessment districts. 
(1)  Connection of single-family residential structures to the City's main service facilities. In the event a single-family residential structure located within a special assessment district or utility service area is required to connect to the City's water and/or wastewater systems as required in subsection (a) (2) (b) of this section, the owner of such structure shall have the opportunity to elect to repay the cost thereof by use of a capital charge agreement (CCA). 
A capital charge agreement (CCA) is defined as an agreement between the City of Port St. Lucie and the property owner(s) of record. The agreement allows repayment to the City of Port St. Lucie, for the cost of connecting water and/or wastewater (sewer) to the City's main service facility, over a period of ten years (120 months), in monthly installments, without the accrual of interest on the principal amount. The CCA will be recorded in the Public Records of St. Lucie County and become a lien upon the subject property until satisfied in full. The CCA is available for connecting service to a subject property one time only and is not available for new construction. 
Payments will be assessed to the service customer monthly, until the principal amount is paid in full. Failure to pay when due may result in the acceleration of the total amount due, interruption of service, and such other remedies as may apply. If the service customer is not the property owner of record, such payments shall be negotiated between those parties; the City will not participate in such negotiations. 
(2)  Transfer of interest in real property. After January 1, 2001, any transfer of interest in a property upon which a CCA has been recorded in the public records as a lien, will be affected in the following manner: 
a.  Sale of home. City will allow the continuation of the existing CCA under its original agreed upon terms and conditions, subject to the following requirements: 
1.  Completion of an application and payment of an administration fee in the amount of $200.00; 
2.  All utility accounts charged to the subject property must be current; 
3.  Review and approval by the City's Legal Department of an assumption agreement which must be properly executed by all transferees in interest; 
4.  If applicable, review and approval by the City's Legal Department of subordination documents; 
5.  The City shall never subordinate to an inferior position greater than second; and 
6.  All approved agreements made with the City, hereunder, must be recorded simultaneously with all other closing documents. An additional administrative fee of $75.00 will be charged for any subordination or assumption agreement submitted for review after having been denied by the legal department for just cause. 
b.  Refinance. On the condition that all utility accounts are current, the City will allow the continuation of the CCA under its original agreed upon terms and conditions. The City will subordinate its interest in the property, after review of subordination documents by the City's Legal Department and payment of an administrative fee to be established by the City Manager, or designee. The City shall never be subordinate to an inferior position greater than second. Such document shall be recorded simultaneously with all other closing documents. 
c.  Divorce. On the condition that all utility accounts are current, the City will allow the continuation of the CCA, under its original agreed upon terms and conditions, to the spouse who retains ownership of the residence. That spouse may be required to execute an assumption agreement which shall be reviewed by the City's Legal Department. Payment of an administrative fee to be established by the City Manager, or designee. A CCA shall never be subordinate to an inferior position greater than second, otherwise the balance due must be paid in full. 
d.  Transfer by probate. 
1.  To surviving spouse. On the condition that all utility accounts are current, the City will allow the continuation of the CCA to the surviving spouse, under its original agreed upon terms and conditions.

2.  To other than surviving spouse. The unpaid balance of the CCA may be due and payable to the City of Port St. Lucie at the time of transfer. 
e.  Foreclosure transfer. (Any transfer of interest in property after a certificate of title has passed to a financial institution or guarantor and the utility connection fee has not been completely satisfied.) The purchaser of such a property may either (1) make payment in full to the City for the balance of all outstanding utility delinquencies, including the unpaid CCA; or (2) utilize Section 63.25(b)(2) herein, as if the property owner was connecting for the first time. 
f.  Bankruptcy. Upon notice of the filing of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, the City will immediately cease any affirmative collection of delinquent payments on the CCA, in advance of the date of filing. As a condition of continued service, an additional deposit shall be required and a restatement of debt in the amount of the balance due shall be recorded in the public records. 
g.  Government guaranteed financing. (VA/FHA) If utility connection is a condition of the lender, the purchaser may utilize Section 63.25 (b)(2) herein, and a CCA shall be processed as an element of the closing. 
(3)  Delinquencies. In the event of a delinquency on any utility usage or base account having a CCA, the following shall take place: 
a.  Delinquent payments on CCA. The City will allow continuation of a CCA, on the condition that all payments are brought current before an interruption of service. In the event of an interruption of service, the unpaid balance of the CCA will be due and payable, in full, before service is restored. 
b.  Unpaid usage or monthly base facility charges. In the event of an interruption of service or a 90-day arrearage in the monthly base facility charge for water or wastewater service, the unpaid balance of a CCA and all delinquent usage and base charges are due and payable, in full, before service is restored. 
(4)  Hardship transfer subject to 63.25(b)(3)a. Upon demonstration of a financial hardship by the owner of a property upon which a CCA is recorded and on condition that all utility service accounts are current, the City Manager, or designee, may approve a modification of the terms of the existing agreement (CCA) or conditions precedent to the assumption or subordination of a CCA under this section. After review of the request, the City Manager, or designee may, within 14 days of the request, consent to such other condition(s) as may be appropriate. A CCA shall never be subordinated to an inferior position greater than second. An appeal of a denial of a hardship request may be heard by the City Council not later than 30 days, thereafter. 
(5)  Connection of multi-family residential, commercial, industrial buildings, or buildings owned by non-profit organizations to the City's main service facilities. 
(a)  Multi-family residential, commercial, or industrial buildings: In the event an existing non single-family residential, commercial or industrial building/structure is required to connect to the City's water and/or wastewater systems as required in subsection (2) (b) of this section, or one is proposed to be constructed, the owner of such building or structure shall have the opportunity to elect to pay the cost of related capital charges over a period of one year, in twelve monthly installments, without the accrual of interest on the principal amount until all charges have been paid in full. A property owner's election to make such installment payments shall be memorialized by the execution of a utility service agreement addressing related terms and conditions. The City will record such agreements in the Public Records of St. Lucie County. 
(b)  Nonprofit organizations: In the event a nonprofit organization that has been qualified as a charitable organization for Federal Income Tax purposes owns a building/structure that is required to connect to the City's water and/or wastewater systems, or proposes to construct one, the organization as owner of such building or structure shall have the opportunity to elect to pay the cost of related capital charges over a period of up to ten years, in as many as 120 monthly installments, without the accrual of interest on the principal amount until all charges have been paid in full.

(10)  Unauthorized dumping of any material from vehicles, tanks, or trailers operated by a septic or waste hauler is prohibited. 
(g)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the Utility Systems Director that such wastes could harm either the City's wastewater collection system, wastewater treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream or other effluent disposal facilities or systems, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance. The Utility Systems Director will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are: 
(1)  Any sewage or wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in any city POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the treatment works influent exceeds 100°F, unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature. 
(2)  Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32°F and 100°F. 
(3)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. 
(4)  Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not. 
(5)  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other wastes or odiferous ash producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the Utility Systems Director, as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies or jurisdiction for such discharge to the waters of the state or nation. 
(6)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes. 
(7)  Any pollutants, including oxygen demand pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to any city POTW. In no case shall a slug load be discharged to the city's wastewater system. 
(8)  Waters or wastes containing substances, including non-biodegradable detergents, which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are amenable to treatment only to the degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirement of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the waters of the state or nation or violates any contract, resolution, law, rule, regulation, permit, or approval applicable to the industrial, commercial, or agricultural reuse of reclaimed water. 
(9)  Any concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
(10)  When the Utility Systems Director determines that a user is contributing to any portion of the wastewater system, any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to cause a pass through, cause a violation of any applicable permit or contract, or otherwise interfere with the operation of the system, the Utility Systems Director shall: 
a.  Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on said POTW; and 
b.  Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference with said POTW. 
(h)  No persons shall discharge sewage or wastewater in excess of the concentration set forth in the table below unless: an exception has been granted the user under the provisions of Section 64.08; or the wastewater discharge permit of the user provides as a special permit condition a higher interim concentration level in conjunction with a requirement that the user construct a pretreatment facility or institute changes in operation and maintenance procedures to reduce the concentration of pollutants to levels not exceeding the standards set forth in the table within a fixed period of time.

(10)  Any other information as may be deemed by the city to be necessary to evaluate the permit application. 
(e)  Processing and issuance of permits. The City will evaluate the data furnished by the applicant and may require additional information. A proposed permit may be issued within 60 days after all data has been furnished to and accepted by the city. The applicant shall then be allowed a 30 day comment period. Upon the expiration of the comment period, or upon the expiration of 90 days from the date the data has been furnished and accepted, the City shall issue or deny a permit; a permit may contain appropriate restrictions. Issuance of a permit shall not relieve the discharger from complying with all applicable permits, laws, regulations, and ordinances promulgated by the City or other governmental authorities, and any applicable sewer service allocation or connection rules, nor shall the issuance of a permit be construed as a representation by the City that the discharge permitted therein complies with all of such permits, laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. Permits are issued solely to govern the discharge of wastewater into the wastewater system and effluent disposal system, as between the discharger and the City, and shall not be construed to benefit any third party. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no industrial wastewater discharge permit shall be issued to any person who has not yet obtained a wastewater disposal permit pursuant to applicable sewer service allocation or connection rules. 
(f)  Permit restrictions. The restrictions in permits shall be uniformly enforced by the City and may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The maximum permissible concentration of wastewater constituents.

(11)  Requirements for notification of slug or accidental discharges. 
(12)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
(g)  Pretreatment requirements. If pretreatment is required through the issuance of an industrial wastewater discharge permit, users of the POTW shall design, construct, operate, and maintain such wastewater pretreatment facilities whenever necessary to reduce or modify the user's wastewater constituency to achieve compliance with the limitations in wastewater strength set forth in Section 64.04, to meet applicable national pretreatment standards, or to meet any other wastewater condition or limitation contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. Plans, specifications, and operating procedures for such wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be prepared by a registered engineer, and shall be submitted to the Utility Systems Director for review in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The Utility Systems Director shall review said plans within 45 days and shall recommend to the user any appropriate changes or approve or reject plans. Prior to beginning construction of said pretreatment facility, the user shall submit a set of construction plans and specifications to be maintained by the Utility Systems Director. Prior to beginning construction the user shall also secure such building, plumbing, or other permits that may be required by the City code. The user shall construct said pretreatment facility within the time provided in the user's wastewater discharge permit. Following completion of construction, the user shall provide the utilities director with "as built" drawings to be maintained by the Utility Systems Director. Neither filing of the plans nor the issuance of a permit shall be construed to indicate that the City in any way vouches for or warrants the capabilities of any such plans, specifications, or data in any manner. Subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without prior notice to the City. 
(h)  Duration of permits. Permits shall be issued for any specified period of time, not to exceed five years. 
(i)  Modification of permits. The terms and conditions of any permit may be subject to modification and change by the City during the life of the permit to accommodate changed conditions and as local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations are modified or amended or in event of variation in reported data as provided in this section. Permit holders shall be informed of any proposed changes in their respective permits at least 60 days prior to the effective date of change, and shall be allowed a comment period relating to any of the proposed changes in their permits within the first 30 days after issuance of such proposed change by the City. The City shall allow a discharger a reasonable period of time to comply with any changes in the permit required by the City, unless otherwise required by emergency or governmental regulations. Nothing in these regulations is intended to preclude the City from taking immediate action to temporarily modify a permit when there is imminent risk of injury to the wastewater system or to the health and welfare of the public or to the environment. 
(j)  Permits not transferable. A separate permit shall be required for each wastewater connection discharging into the sewerage system. For each discharger having multiple connections at a single plant or facility, a single permit shall be required which may set forth specific effluent limitations and conditions for discharge from each separate connection. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, or for different premises, unless approved by the Utility Systems Director. 
(k)  Enforcement. The Utility Systems Director may suspend the wastewater service and/or a permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Utility Systems Director, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which represents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
(1)  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater service and/or the permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater system or endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within five calendar days of the date of occurrence. 
(2)  Revocation of permit. Any user who violates any of the following conditions of this chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures outlined in this chapter: 
(a)  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(b)  Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(c)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(d)  Obtaining of a permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts; 
(e)  A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge; or 
(f)  Violation of conditions of the permit. 
(3)  Whenever the City finds that any user has violated or is violating this chapter, permit, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the City may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the City by the user. 
(4)  Show cause hearing. The City may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause before the City why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the City why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The City may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the city to: 
(a)  Issue in the name of the City notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
(b)  Take the evidence; 
(c)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the City for action thereon; 
(d)  After the City has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the wastewater service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(l)  Special agreement variance. The City may grant a variance from the permitting requirements of this section only for those industrial users with which the City executes an agreement providing for the City to construct and operate, at the cost of the industrial user, a pretreatment facility which is capable of achieving compliance with the limitations in wastewater strength set forth in Section 64.04, the national categorical pretreatment standards, and applicable state treatment requirements. The City may agree to share the costs of operation and construction of the pretreatment facility if it receives, in its opinion, benefits to the wastewater system. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, no industrial user shall add into the wastewater system any toxic pollutant as set forth in Appendix "B," of 40 C.F.R., Part 403, or any pollutant that may interfere, pass through, or otherwise be incompatible with the wastewater system.

The failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the Customer to install a backflow preventer as required in this Section shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the Customer's premises until the installation has been satisfactorily completed. Upon failure, refusal, or otherwise inability to have such backflow preventer installed, the Utility may perform the installation at the Customer's expense. Any costs or expenses incurred by the Utility to effect the installation must be remitted to the Utility before service is restored. 
(b)  Cross-Connection Control - Requirements 
1.  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the Utility unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this section. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the Utility if an approved backflow preventer required by this section is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that an approved backflow preventer has been removed or bypassed. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
2.  The Customer's system shall be accessible for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the Utility to determine compliance with the City's Code of Ordinances and other regulations relating to cross-connections. If it is determined upon inspection that the Customer's water system is not in compliance, the Utility Systems Director shall give notice to the Customer to correct the violation. If the violation(s) constitute a health hazard, the Utility Systems Director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the violation has been corrected. 
3.  An approved backflow preventer shall be installed on each non-residential service connection to a Customer's water system at or near the property line; outside the building or business; or, located elsewhere at the discretion of the Utility Systems Director, but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line. 
4.  The type of backflow preventer required shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists. The means of backflow prevention, listed below in an increasing level of protection, include the following: 
i.  A Dual Check (DuC) device; 
ii.  An Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker (AVB) device; 
iii.  A Double Check Valve Assembly (DCVA) or Double Check Detector Assembly (DCDA); 
iv.  A Pressure Vacuum Breaker Assembly (PVB); 
v.  A Reduced-Pressure Principle Assembly (RPBA) or Reduced-Pressure Principle Detector Assembly (RPDA); and 
vi.  An Air Gap (AG). 
5.  An approved backflow preventer shall be provided at the service connection based on the degree of hazard as follows: 
i.  Premises where there is an auxiliary water system, a DuC shall be provided for residential service connections. A RPBA shall be provided for non-residential service connections. There shall be no cross-connection between the Customer's water system and the auxiliary water system. 
ii.  Premises with private fire protection connected directly to the City's water system, a DCVA or DCDA will be provided if the fire protection system contains no chemical additives. A RPBA or RPDA shall be provided if the fire protection system contains chemical additives.

iv.  Premises where it is impossible or impractical for the Utility to conduct a cross-connection survey to determine the degree of hazard, an AG or a RPBA shall be provided. 
v.  If, in the opinion of the Utility Systems Director, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, an AG will be required to protect the City's water system. 
vi.  Premises where a lawn irrigation system is connected to the Customer's water system, a PVB shall be provided. The unit shall be installed a minimum of 12 inches above the highest outlet. An AVB may be used when there are no shut-off valves downstream providing there is no potential for downstream back pressure. The unit shall be installed a minimum of 6 inches above the highest outlet. 
vii.  Premises where a lawn irrigation system is directly connected to the City's water system, a RPBA shall be provided. 
6.  Backflow Preventer Standards. Any backflow preventer required herein shall conform to the standards and specifications of the City of Port St. Lucie Utility Systems Department's Utility Standards Manual and be included in the said manual's Qualified Products List. 
7.  The Utility Systems Director may approve backflow preventers that do not meet the requirements of this section, but were approved for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained. Said backflow preventers much still meet inspection and maintenance requirements and the Utility Systems Director must be assured that they will satisfactorily protect the Utility system. Whenever the existing backflow preventer is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the Utility Systems Director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow preventer meeting the requirements of this section.

Sec. 73.15. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that the driving, riding, and use of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters, jeeps, or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the limits of the city is and can be the cause of noise and dust and of the destruction of plants, other ecological damage, and damage to landscaping and other personal and real property, which conduct adversely affects the comfort and privacy of occupants and residents of the city. Because the conduct may be intermittent, fleeting, moving, or caused by persons who are minors, the noise and public nuisance provisions of this Code, as well as other legal remedies, are inadequate to control the conduct and its adverse effects. The provisions of this subchapter relating to the regulations of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters, jeeps, or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles are therefore necessary for the public welfare. 
(b)  The city council declares that the purpose of this section is to exercise the general police power in order to protect the enjoyment and use of public and private property, to protect the rights of privacy, to preserve property and personal values, and to promote peace and quiet within the city by regulating the use of motorcycles, motor bikes, minibikes, dirt bikes, trail bikes, dune buggies, motor scooters, jeeps, or other forms of off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the city.

(b)  The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the operation of off-highway motor vehicles upon the property of another when the motor vehicles are: 
(1)  Authorized emergency vehicles; 
(2)  Used for ingress to and egress from, and parking upon, parking lots or structures open to the public or private parking lots;

The towing or removal of any vehicle from private property without the consent of the registered owner or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle is subject to strict compliance with the following conditions and restrictions: 
(1)  a.  Any towed or removed vehicle must be stored at a site within 15 miles of the point of removal. That site must be open for the purpose of redemption of vehicles on any date that the person or firm towing such vehicle is open for towing purposes, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and, when closed, shall have prominently posted a sign indicating a telephone number where the operator of the site can be reached at all times. Upon receipt of a telephoned request to open the site to redeem a vehicle, the operator shall return to the site within one hour or he will be in violation of this section. 
b.  If no towing business providing such service is located within the area of towing limitations set forth in subsection (1)a. above, the following limitations apply. Any towed or removed vehicle must be stored at a site within 30 miles of the point of removal. 
(2)  The person or firm towing or removing the vehicle shall, within 30 minutes of completion of such towing or removal, notify the police department of the city of such towing or removal, the storage site, the time the vehicle was towed or removed, the make, model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle, and shall obtain the name of the person at the police department to whom such information was reported and note that name on the trip record. 
(3)  If the registered owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle arrives at the scene prior to removal or towing of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be disconnected from the towing or removal apparatus, and that person shall be allowed to remove the vehicle without interference upon the payment of a reasonable service fee of not more than one-half of the posted rate for such towing service as provided in subsection (b)(6) below, for which a receipt shall be given, unless that person refuses to remove the vehicle which is otherwise unlawfully parked. 
(4)  The rebate or payment of money or any other valuable consideration from the individual or firm towing or removing vehicles to the owners or operators of the premises from which the vehicles are towed or removed, for the privilege of removing or towing those vehicles, is prohibited.

a.  The notice must be prominently placed at each driveway access or cub [curb] cut allowing vehicular access to the property, within five feet from the public right-of-way line. If there are no curbs or access barriers, the signs must be posted not less than one sign for each 25 feet of lot frontage.

e.  The city may require permitting and inspection of these signs prior to any towing or removal of vehicles being authorized. 
f.  A business with 20 or fewer parking spaces satisfies the notice requirements of this section by prominently displaying a sign stating "reserved parking for customers only-unauthorized vehicles will be towed away at the owner's expense" in not less than four-inch high, light-reflective letters on a contrasting background. A business owner or lessee may authorize the removal of a vehicle by a towing company when the vehicle is parked in a manner that restricts the normal operation of business; and if a vehicle parked on a public right-of-way obstructs access to a private driveway the owner, lessee, or agent may have the vehicle removed by a towing company upon signing an order that the vehicle be removed without a posted tow-away zone sign. 
(6)  Any person or firm that tows or removes vehicles and proposes to require an owner, operator, or person in control of a vehicle to pay the costs of towing and storage prior to redemption of the vehicle must file and keep on record with the city's Police Department a complete copy of the current rates to be charged for such services, and post at the storage site an identical rate schedule and any written contracts with property owners, lessees, or persons in control of property which authorize such person or firm to remove vehicles as provided in this section.

(8)  Vehicle entry for the purpose of removing the vehicle shall be allowed with reasonable care on the part of the person or firm towing the vehicle. Such person or firm shall be liable for any damage occasioned to the vehicle if such entry is not in accordance with the standard of reasonable care. 
(9)  When a vehicle has been towed or removed pursuant to this section, it must be released to its owner or custodian within one hour after requested. Any vehicle owner, custodian, or agent shall have the right to inspect the vehicle before accepting its return, and no release or waiver of any kind which would release the person or firm towing the vehicle from liability for damages noted by the owner or other legally authorized person at the time of the redemption may be required from any vehicle owner, custodian, or agent as a condition of release of the vehicle to its owner. A detailed, signed receipt showing the legal name of the company or person towing or removing the vehicle must be given to the person paying towing or storage charges at the time of payment, whether requested or not. 
(c)  These requirements shall be the minimum standards and shall not preclude enactment of additional regulations by the city including the right to regulate rates when vehicles are towed from private property. 
(d)  This section does not apply to law enforcement, firefighting, rescue squad, ambulance, or other emergency vehicles which are marked as such or to property owned by any governmental entity. 
(e)  When a person improperly causes a vehicle to be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or lessee of the vehicle for the cost of removal, transportation, and storage; any damages resulting from the removal, transportation, or storage of the vehicle; attorneys' fees; and court costs.

(b)  Such an exemption applies to each classification for which a business tax receipt is required. Classifications shall be the same in an enterprise zone as elsewhere in the city. Each business tax receipt issued with the exemption authorized in this section shall be in the same general form as all other business tax receipts and shall expire at the same time as those other tax receipts expire. Any tax receipt issued with the exemption authorized in this section is nontransferable. The exemption authorized in this section does not apply to any penalty authorized in section 111.21(b).

CHAPTER 113. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 
Article I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 113.01. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Adult Entertainment Code." 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 1, 1-25-99) 
Sec. 113.02. - Authority. 
    This chapter is enacted under the home rule power of the city in the interest of the health, safety, peace, and general welfare of the people of the city and under the authority of the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 2, 1-25-99) 
Sec. 113.03. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate adult entertainment businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Port St. Lucie, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious effects of location and concentration of adult entertainment businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose or intent of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials, or other aspects of constitutionally protected speech. It is not the intent of the city council to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity, as those matters are regulated by federal and state law. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult oriented material to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 3, 1-25-99) 
Sec. 113.04. - Findings of fact. 
    The city has considered evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the planning and zoning board and the city council, and based upon the findings incorporated in studies conducted by other governmental units, including but not limited to, the following studies prepared by other jurisdictions: statistical synopsis of police calls to adult entertainment businesses (Stuart, Martin County, Florida, 1993); statistical synopsis of police response calls to adult entertainment businesses in St. Lucie County (1993); correspondence by Florida State University Professor, Margaret A. Baldwin, Esq., as testimony on scholarly research regarding an adult business, (Tallahassee, Florida, 1993); "Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin," Texas (1985); "Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, an Analysis," Indiana (1984); "The Impact of Adult Entertainment Centers on the Community of Tampa, Florida," (1982); "Study of the Effects of the Concentration of Adult Entertainment Establishments in the City of Los Angeles," California (1977); and findings of the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department and the State Attorney's office detailing the secondary effects of and the potential for criminal activities associated with adult uses. The city further relies upon the findings incorporated in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed. 2d 29 (1986); Young v. American Mini-Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed. 2d 310 (1975); Bonnell, Inc. v. Board of Adjustments, 791 P.2d 107 (Okl. App. 1989), and has considered such other public input, research, and legal analysis which the city council relies upon and believes to be relevant to problems associated with adult uses. The city determines that the enactment of a time, place, and manner ordinance regulating and addressing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment uses is an appropriate exercise of the municipal home rule power in the interest of the health, peace, safety, morals, and general welfare of the people of the city. Specifically, the city council finds and determines, based upon the foregoing, as follows: 
(a)  Sexually oriented activities, including the sale of adult entertainment material and nude, semi-nude or topless dancing gives rise to prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution, and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons or property; 
(b)  When the sexual activities described in subsection (a) are actively marketed in commercial establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above, and ultimately force residents and businesses to move to other locations; 
(c)  The activities described in subsection (a) above often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely effecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment; 
(d)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment establishments; 
(e)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at adult entertainment establishments; 
(f)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by allowing adult entertainment establishments to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a permit under this Code are so great as to require the permitting of such establishments prior to their being authorized to operate; 
(g)  Requiring operators of adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, expediting the investigation of the transmission of certain communicable and social diseases, and by making it difficult for minors to work in such establishments; 
(h)  Prohibiting adult entertainment establishments from operating within certain distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, libraries, areas zoned or designated for residential use, parks, and other protected areas at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments; 
(i)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, or physical contact or touching within adult entertainment establishments poses a threat to the health of both customers and employees and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. Straddle dancing is deemed primarily conduct rather than communication or expression; 
(j)  Adult entertainment establishments involve activities which are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, wherein speech or expressive activity is nonexistent or incidental thereto, and are therefore subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the community; and 
(k)  Physical contact or touching within adult entertainment establishments between workers and/or customers, wherein specified anatomical areas are exhibited, poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases.

Existing licensees operating in the city are not required to provide the application described herein. Additionally, if an applicant for a new license is requesting an overlapping license within the city, the city shall make a further determination in the public interest as to whether the economic impact upon an existing licensee will result in a loss of or degradation of cable service to existing or potential cable subscribers in the city. 
(e)  Evaluation criteria general.

(h)  Grant of license. 
(1)  The city may grant a license for all or any defined portion of the city. 
(2)  The city may make the grant of a license conditioned upon the substantial completion of construction within a reasonably prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in the license, specifying that failure to comply with the conditions will cause the license to become null and void without further action by the city. 
(3)  The city shall hold a public hearing to consider an application or applications. The applicant(s) shall be notified of the hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application(s), the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city manager or staff, and any other information relevant to the application(s), the city shall decide by ordinance whether to grant or deny a license application(s) and decide the terms and conditions of any license(s) granted.

If the acceptance is not filed with the city within 45 calendar days from the date of the licensee's receipt of the city's ordinance approving the license, or if the period is not extended by the city, the license grant will be null and void without further action of the city. In the case of a renewal, the city may, at its option, grant licensee a short term extension(s) until a license agreement is reached. The grant of such a short term extension(s) will not confer on the licensee the right to an automatic acceptance, transfer, modification or renewal. 
(5)  Any license granted pursuant to the ordinance shall be nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to (i) grant at any time such additional licenses for a cable communication system as it deems appropriate, and/or (ii) build, operate, and own such cable communication system or systems as it deems appropriate. In awarding such additional overlapping licenses, or in building and operating its own cable communications system, the city shall not grant overlapping licenses for cable service on terms or conditions more favorable or less burdensome taken as a whole, than those in any existing license if any existing licensee is actually making cable service available in the area where the overlapping license is being sought. A licensee may apply for modification of license requirements or to be excused from any requirements of this chapter which are not similarly imposed on competing cable licensees serving the city.

A licensee hereunder, or any person operating a cable system pending issuance of a license by the city shall pay to the city an annual fee in an amount as designated in the license agreement, not to exceed the greater of five percent of the annual gross revenues or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Such payment shall be as compensation for the privilege of the use of the city's streets and rights-of-way to construct and/or operate a cable system in addition to any other fees. The city, if it so requests, shall be furnished a financial analysis by licensee and certified by licensee's chief financial officer, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment. In the event the communications act or other applicable law is amended to permit the city to assess a license fee of a greater amount than specified herein (five percent), the licensee agrees to immediately enter good faith negotiations with respect to increasing the amount of the fee payment. 
(2)  Payments made in installments. Payment of the amount to be paid to the city by the licensee under the terms of this section and any license agreement shall be made in quarterly installments commencing 90 days after the effective date of a license agreement, or at such other date as may be provided in a license agreement. Each quarterly installment shall be calculated on the basis of the licensee's gross revenues for the quarter ending 60 days prior to each scheduled quarterly payment or such other manner as may be provided in a license agreement. The final installment for each fiscal year of the license agreement shall be adjusted to reflect any underpayment or overpayment for said fiscal year. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the computation and such other relevant facts as may be required by the city. 
(3)  Acceptance by the city. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a license fee under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the licensee. 
(4)  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any license payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, licensee shall pay as additional compensation: 
a.  An interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate of eight percent; and 
b.  A sum of money equal to five percent of the amount due in order to defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by the city by reason of delinquent payment. 
(5)  Application fee schedule. To be acceptable for filing, an application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee in the following amounts, as appropriate: 
a.  For a new or initial license-$10,000.00. 
b.  For a renewal of a license-$5,000.00. 
c.  For a transfer of a license-$2,500.00. 
d.  For a modification of a license-$2,500.00.

Sec. 114.06. - Changes in ownership and/or control. 
    The restrictions, requirements, and procedures contained in this section apply if the transaction proposed is an assignment of a license to a separate legal entity not under common control. The terms "assignor" and "assignee" respectively should be used in lieu of "transferor" and "transferee" as used herein, if the transaction proposed is an assignment of license. 
(1)  Prior consent required. Any license granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held by the licensee for the benefit of the public. Said license cannot be assigned, or control thereof transferred by any means whatsoever including, but not limited to, voluntary or involuntary sale, consolidation, foreclosure, receivership, or other means without the prior written consent of the city or as otherwise may be provided in the license. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(2)  Control. The phrases "change in control" and "transfer of control" as used herein shall mean the acquisition or transfer by any person or group of persons of actual working control of the licensee, whether directly or indirectly, by a single transaction or series of transactions, and regardless of the manner in which it is exercised. Corporate reorganizations which do not change the ultimate controlling entity and intrafamilial transactions are not considered transfers of control for purposes of these provisions. 
(3)  Application(s) for consent. 
a.  Transferor and transferee must file. Whenever a licensee desires to effect a transfer of control of the licensee or assign the license to another legal entity, the licensee and the proposed transferee shall make a joint application for consent to transfer of control or assignment of license, as appropriate, to the city council. Such applications must be signed; if a corporation, by an officer authorized to sign for the purpose, if a partnership, by a general partner, if a proprietorship or joint venture, by a responsible principal. Applications shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, together with the appropriate fee. 
b.  Public notice required. Notice of the filing of application(s) for consent shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least once a week during the 14 days immediately following the date upon which filed, the cost of publication to be borne by the applicants. A public hearing will be conducted within 30 days from the date the application(s) for consent is received by the city clerk. 
c.  Processing and public hearing. The applications will be referred to the city manager or his designee for processing, evaluation, and a report and recommendations to the city council. No application(s) for consent shall be granted until after the public hearing as provided in subsection 114.06(3)b. hereof. The city council may utilize the services of the city attorney's office and of the city departments, as it may deem appropriate. 
(4)  Consent not a waiver. The consent of the city to any transfer of control or assignment of a license shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city reserved herein or which it has at law. Any consent by city shall be construed to subject the new licensee to all of the terms and conditions of the original license, provided however, that the city, in its sole discretion upon written request by the proposed licensee accompanied by a satisfactory supporting statement made prior to final action on the application for consent may, after public hearing, modify the license as may appear appropriate. 
(5)  Fee and forfeiture. No application for consent to assignment or transfer of control of a license will be granted until all fees and forfeitures due the city hereunder have been paid, and all lawful claims which the city may have against the transferor have been settled. 
(6)  Acceptance by transferee. No assignment or transfer of control shall be effective until the new grantee has become a signatory to the license.

The provisions of subsections (e) through (k) below, shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection.

(1)  Identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests; and 
(2)  Reviewing the performance of the licensee under the license during the then-current license term. 
    Upon completion of a proceeding under this subsection which shall terminate six months following its commencement, a licensee seeking renewal of a license may, on its own initiative or at the request of the city, submit a proposal for renewal. 
(c)  Proposal. Any such proposal for renewal shall contain such material as the city may require including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.

(3)  The licensee has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the licensee's proposal; and 
(4)  The licensee's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests. 
(f)  Public proceedings. In any public proceeding the licensee shall be afforded adequate notice and the licensee and the city, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (b) above), to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding by the licensee. The licensee shall be responsible for any costs associated with the transcript. 
(g)  Written renewal decision. At the completion of a proceeding under this section, the city shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the licensee.

(h)  Renewal denial. Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subsections (e)(1) through (e)(4) above, pursuant to the record of the proceeding. The city may not base a denial of the renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the license under subsection (e)(1) above, or on events considered under subsection (e)(2) above, in any case in which a violation of the license or the events considered under subsection (e)(2) above, occur after December 29, 1984, unless the city has provided the licensee with reasonable notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the licensee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the city fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(i)  Licensee renewal appeal. Any licensee whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of the city made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the city to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of Section 635 of the Communications Act. The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that: 
(1)  Any action of the city is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or 
(2)  In the event of a final decision of the city denying the renewal proposal, the licensee has demonstrated that the adverse findings of the city with respect to each of the factors described in subsections (e)(1)(4) above, on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (e).

Such notice shall specify as may be applicable the failures, neglect, refusals, actions, conditions, circumstances, violations, defaults or breaches which constitute the basis for the proposed revocation or suspension and make demand upon the licensee to implement prompt corrective measures to remedy such failures, neglect, refusals, actions, conditions, circumstances, violations, defaults or breaches and effect substantial compliance with the terms of this chapter and the license. If the licensee shall fail to implement corrective action within 60 days following written notice, the city shall cause to be served upon the licensee by certified mail a written notice and order to show cause why its license should not be revoked or suspended and shall fix a date, time and place for a public hearing before the city council, provided however, that the licensee shall be entitled to not less than 30 days' prior notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing.

(6)  Upon conclusion of the administrative hearing the city council shall make its findings and conclusions as to whether the allegations made or contained in the notice and order to show cause occurred or existed as charged, whether or not any such failures, refusals, neglect, actions, conditions, circumstances, violations, defaults or breaches occurred or existed with just cause, or, if not, whether on the basis of the evidence adduced some lesser penalty or remedy is appropriate. If such cause is founded, the city council shall direct the licensee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. If licensee shall fail to comply as directed within the time prescribed, the license shall be deemed to be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, unless the city council shall thereafter prescribe some lesser penalty or remedy. 
(c)  Appeal. If the city council's determination is to revoke or suspend the license, the licensee may, subject to exhaustion of administrative remedies, have such decision reviewed by the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit of the State of Florida in and for St. Lucie County, Florida, or, if in federal court, in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in accordance with the procedure and within the time provided by the Florida Appellate Rules or the Federal Appellate Rules, as appropriate for the review of the rulings of any commission or board, which rules or practice and procedures are hereby adopted.

(f)  Failure to exercise right or require compliance. Subject to applicable law, the failure of the city or a licensee, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or require compliance or performance under this chapter or a license granted pursuant to this chapter shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or a forfeiture of a right to compel compliance or performance. 
(g)  Subscriber privacy. 
(1)  Monitoring restricted. No signals of a Class IV cable communications channel shall be transmitted from a subscriber terminal for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices without the express written permission of the subscriber. A licensee desiring such permission shall utilize a printed form, and only that form. The form shall contain a clearly printed legend concisely and explicitly informing subscriber that he or she is under no obligation to grant consent and that any consent granted may be withdrawn at any time without penalty of any kind whatsoever. Such written permission shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which shall be renewable at the option of the subscriber. Specific authorization is required for each type or classification of class IV cable television activity planned; provided, however, that the licensee shall be entitled without obtaining prior consent to conduct system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" or "tap audits" for the purpose of verifying system integrity, detecting and preventing theft of service, controlling return-path transmission, or billing for services or for the collection of such other data as is permitted by law.

e.  Willfully sell, rent or lend, or promote or advertise for sale, rental or use, without actual authority from the licensee of such cable television service, any device which is electronically capable of decoding cable television signals which have been encoded by the licensee or any person under contract with such licensee. 
(2)  Any law enforcement department of the city having jurisdiction shall have the authority to confiscate any and all such instruments, apparatus, equipment, devises, instructions and plans described in this section, including any materials, tools, machinery, or equipment used to manufacture or produce such instruments, apparatus, equipment, devices, instructions and plans, and upon conviction for violation of the provisions of this section, such instruments, apparatus, equipment, devises, instructions and plans, together with all such materials, tools, machinery, and equipment used to manufacture or produce same shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by order of court.

The plat, or the easement, if platting is not required, shall specifically provide for the uses of such easement by the licensed cable television system. Notwithstanding such express requirements, any development approval or building permit issued for such subdivision, planned unit development or multi-family projects of ten or more units shall be deemed to include as a condition of said approval pursuant to the city's police power an easement to the cable television licensee in the area to install, construct and maintain cable television facilities and equipment to insure nonexclusive access to duly licensed cable television services to persons residing in said subdivisions, planned unit developments or multi-family projects. No person, complex owner or agent required to provide easements under this section shall charge any fee or exact any compensation from the cable television licensee for the right to use such easements except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
(j)  Copies of official communications and reports. Upon request, the licensee shall make available to the city copies of all pleadings, applications, reports, communications and documents of any kind, submitted by the licensee to any federal, state and local courts, regulatory agencies and other government bodies relating to its cable television operations within the license territory as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence and actions by such courts, agencies and bodies.

In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended, or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof or thereof which has been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules and regulations then in effect, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, provided the city shall give the licensee 90 days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision. 
(l)  Same-Material provisions. If any section of this chapter or license is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction or is preempted by federal, state or local regulations or laws, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

CHAPTER 118. - SYNTHETIC DRUGS 

Sec. 118.101. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council of the City of Port St. Lucie finds and declares that the products and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used as alternatives to marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The city council further finds that these synthetic substances are particularly appealing to youth, and that these synthetic substances are potentially dangerous to users in the short term and the long-term effects are not yet known. The city council finds that the products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not for human consumption" to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients. The city council finds that drug designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the city council finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for sale, purchase with intent to sell, and public display for sale of synthetic substances that mimic illegal controlled substances, even though such synthetic substances have not yet themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or state law. The city council further finds that it is proper and necessary for the city council to exercise its authority to safeguard and protect public health, safety, and welfare by taking this action.

SECTION 105 PERMITS 
105.1 Required. Any owner or authorized agent who intends to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any required impact-resistant coverings, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by this code, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit. 
105.1.1 Annual facility permit. In lieu of an individual permit for each alteration to an existing electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing or interior nonstructural office system(s), the building official is authorized to issue an annual permit for any occupancy to facilitate routine or emergency service, repair, refurbishing, minor renovations of service systems or manufacturing equipment installations/relocations. The building official shall be notified of major changes and shall retain the right to make inspections at the facility site as deemed necessary. An annual facility permit shall be assessed with an annual fee and shall be valid for one year from date of issuance. A separate permit shall be obtained for each facility and for each construction trade, as applicable. The permit application shall contain a general description of the parameters of work intended to be performed during the year. 
105.1.2 Annual permit records. The person to whom an annual permit is issued shall keep a detailed record of alterations made under such annual permit. The building official shall have access to such records at all times or such records shall be filed with the building official as designated. 
105.1.3 Food permit. As per Section 500.12, Florida Statutes, a food permit from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is required of any person who operates a food establishment or retail store. 
105.2 Work exempt from permit. Exemptions from permit requirements of this code shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this code. Permits shall not be required for the following: 
Gas: 
1.  Portable heating appliance. 
2.  Replacement of any minor part that does not alter approval of equipment or make such equipment unsafe.

8.  The installation, replacement, removal or metering of any load management control device. 
Plumbing: 
1.  The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe provided, however, that if any concealed trap, drain pipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes defective and it becomes necessary to remove and replace the same with new material, such work shall be considered as new work and a permit shall be obtained and inspection made as provided in this code. 
2.  The clearing of stoppages or the repairing of leaks in pipes, valves or fixtures, and the removal and reinstallation of water closets, provided such repairs do not involve or require the replacement or rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures. 
105.2.1 Emergency repairs. Where equipment replacements and repairs must be performed in an emergency situation, the permit application shall be submitted within the next working business day to the building official. 
105.2.2 Minor repairs. Ordinary minor repairs may be made with the approval of the building official without a permit, provided the repairs do not include the cutting away of any wall, partition or portion thereof, the removal or cutting of any structural beam or load-bearing support, or the removal or change of any required means of egress, or rearrangement of parts of a structure affecting the egress requirements; additionally, ordinary minor repairs shall not include addition to, alteration of, replacement or relocation of any standpipe, water supply, sewer, drainage, drain leader, gas, soil, waste, vent or similar piping, electric wiring systems or mechanical equipment or other work affecting public health or general safety, and such repairs shall not violate any of the provisions of the technical codes. 
105.2.3 Public service agencies. Reserved. 
105.3 Application for permit. To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an application therefor in writing on a form furnished by the building department for that purpose. Permit application forms shall be in the format prescribed by a local administrative board, if applicable, and must comply with the requirements of Section 713.135(5) and (6), Florida Statutes. 
Each application shall be inscribed with the date of application, and the code in effect as of that date. For a building permit for which an application is submitted prior to the effective date of the Florida Building Code, the state minimum building code in effect in the permitting jurisdiction on the date of the application governs the permitted work for the life of the permit and any extension granted to the permit. 
105.3.1 Action on application. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the building official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the building official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this code and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. When authorized through contractual agreement with a school board, in acting on applications for permits, the building official shall give first priority to any applications for the construction of, or addition or renovation to, any school or educational facility. 
105.3.1.1 If a state university, state community college or public-school district elects to use a local government's code compliance offices, fees charged by counties and municipalities for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures, and facilities of state universities, state colleges and public-school districts shall not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the code. 
105.3.1.2 No permit may be issued for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the applicant for such permit provides to the enforcing agency which issues the permit any of the following documents which apply to the construction for which the permit is to be issued and which shall be prepared by or under the direction of an engineer registered under Chapter 471, Florida Statutes: 
1.  Plumbing documents for any new building or addition which requires a plumbing system with more than 250 fixture units or which costs more than $125,000.00. 
2.  Fire sprinkler documents for any new building or addition which includes a fire sprinkler system which contains 50 or more sprinkler heads. A Contractor I, Contractor II or Contractor IV, certified under Section 633.521, Florida Statutes, may design a fire sprinkler system of 49 or fewer heads and may design the alteration of an existing fire sprinkler system if the alteration consists of the relocation, addition or deletion of not more than 49 heads, notwithstanding the size of the existing fire sprinkler system. 
3.  Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning documents for any new building or addition which requires more than a 15-ton-per-system capacity which is designed to accommodate 100 or more persons or for which the system costs more than $125,000.00. This paragraph does not include any document for the replacement or repair of an existing system in which the work does not require altering a structural part of the building or for work on a residential one-, two-, three or four-family structure. 
An air-conditioning system may be designed by an installing air-conditioning contractor certified under Chapter 489, Florida Statutes, to serve any building or addition which is designed to accommodate fewer than 100 persons and requires an air-conditioning system with a value of $125,000.00 or less; and when a 15-ton-per system or less is designed for a singular space of a building and each 15-ton system or less has an independent duct system. Systems not complying with the above require design documents that are to be sealed by a professional engineer. 
Example 1: When a space has two 10-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each unit (system) is less than 15 tons. 
Example 2: Consider a small single-story office building which consists of six individual offices where each office has a single 3-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air-conditioning work is $47,000.00 and the office building accommodates fewer than 100 persons. 
Because the six mechanical units are connected to a common water tower this is considered to be an 18-ton system. It therefore could not be designed by a mechanical or air conditioning contractor. 
NOTE: It was further clarified by the Commission that the limiting criteria of 100 persons and $125,000.00 apply to the building occupancy load and the cost for the total air-conditioning system of the building. 
4.  Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than $5,000.00. 
5.  Electrical documents. See Florida Statutes 471.003(2)(h). 
Documents requiring an engineer seal by this part shall not be valid unless a professional engineer who possesses a valid certificate of registration has signed, dated, and stamped such document as provided in Section 471.025, Florida Statutes. 
105.3.2 Time limitation of application. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned 180 days after the date of filing, unless such application has been pursued in good faith or a permit has been issued; except that the building official is authorized to grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
105.3.3 An enforcing authority may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county, and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies or federal agencies." 
105.3.4 A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within 30 working days of application therefor unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code or the enforcing agency's laws or ordinances. 
105.3.5 Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, Workers' Compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in Section 440.10 and 440.38, Florida Statutes. 
105.3.6 Asbestos removal. Moving, removal or disposal of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where the owner occupies the building, the building is not for sale or lease, and the work is performed according to the owner-builder limitations provided in this paragraph. To qualify for exemption under this paragraph, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application. The permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
Disclosure Statement: State law requires asbestos abatement to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. 
105.4 Conditions of the permit. 
105.4.1 Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 6 months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 6 months after the time the work is commenced. 
105.4.1.1 If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. 
105.4.1.2 If a new permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the work in place and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit. 
105.4.1.3 Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection within 180 days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. 
105.4.1.4 The fee for renewal reissuance and extension of a permit shall be set forth by the administrative authority. 
105.4.1.5 Any residential building permit authorizing work that has not received a certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion within 3 years of the residential building permit's original issuance date shall be considered expired notwithstanding receipt of an approved inspection within 180 days. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, two extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each. All residential building permit extension requests shall be requested in writing 20 days prior to the expiration of the residential building permit, be accompanied by a schedule of completion, and demonstrate justifiable cause. If the expired residential building permit is not extended, and a new residential building permit is not obtained in accordance with section 105.4.1.2 herein, within 90 days of the expiration of the residential building permit, the construction shall be subject to unsafe dwelling/structure abatement proceedings pursuant to Chapter 40 of the Code of Ordinances. This remedy is in addition to, not a limitation of, any other right, power, privilege or remedy, either in law, in equity, or otherwise, to which the City may be entitled. 
105.5 Expiration. Reserved. 
105.6 Suspension or revocation. Reserved. 
105.7 Placement of permit. The building permit or copy shall be kept on the site of the work until the completion of the project. 
105.8 Notice of commencement. As per Section 713.135, Florida Statutes, when any person applies for a building permit, the authority issuing such permit shall print on the face of each permit card in no less than 18-point, capitalized, boldfaced type: "WARNING TO OWNER: YOUR FAILURE TO RECORD A NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT MAY RESULT IN YOUR PAYING TWICE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR PROPERTY. IF YOU INTEND TO OBTAIN FINANCING, CONSULT WITH YOUR LENDER OR AN ATTORNEY BEFORE RECORDING YOUR NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT." 
105.9 Asbestos. The enforcing agency shall require each building permit for the demolition or renovation of an existing structure to contain an asbestos notification statement which indicates the owner's or operator's responsibility to comply with the provisions of Section 469.003, Florida Statutes, and to notify the Department of Environmental Protection of his or her intentions to remove asbestos, when applicable, in accordance with state and federal law. 
105.10 Certificate of protective treatment for prevention of termites. A weather-resistant job-site posting board shall be provided to receive duplicate treatment certificates as each required protective treatment is completed, providing a copy for the person the permit is issued to and another copy for the building permit files. The treatment certificate shall provide the product used, identity of the applicator, time and date of the treatment, site location, area treated, chemical used, percent concentration and number of gallons used, to establish a verifiable record of protective treatment. If the soil chemical barrier method for termite prevention is used, final exterior treatment shall be completed prior to final building approval. 
105.11 Notice of termite protection. A permanent sign which identifies the termite treatment provider and need for reinspection and treatment contract renewal shall be provided. The sign shall be posted near the water heater or electric panel. 
105.12 Work starting before permit issuance. Upon approval of the building official, the scope of work delineated in the building permit application and plan may be started prior to the final approval and issuance of the permit, provided any work completed is entirely at risk of the permit applicant and the work does not proceed past the first required inspection. 
105.13 Phased permit approval. After submittal of the appropriate construction documents, the building official is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure have been submitted. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted. Corrections may be required to meet the requirements of the technical codes. 
105.14 Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity to the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity to the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes.

Sec. 150.511. - Business organizations; qualifying agents. 
(1)  If a contractor proposes to engage in contracting as a partnership, corporation, business trust, or other legal entity or in any name other than his legal name, the contractor shall apply as a qualifying agent for said entity; the application shall state the name of the partnership and of its partners, the name of the corporation and its officers and directors, the name of the business trust and its trustees, or the name of such other legal entity and its members; and the contractor shall furnish evidence of statutory compliance if a fictitious name is used. Such application shall also show that the contractor is legally qualified to act for the business organization in all matters connected with its contracting business and that he has authority to supervise construction undertaken by such business organization. A joint venture, including a joint venture composed of qualified business organizations, is itself a separate and distinct organization that must be qualified in accordance with board rules. The certificate of competency, when issued upon application for a business organization, shall be in the name of the qualifying agent, and the name of the business organization shall be noted thereon. If there is a change in any information that is required to be stated on the application, the business organization shall, within forty-five (45) days after such change occurs, mail the correct information to the department. 
(2)  The qualifying agent shall hold the appropriate certificate of competency appropriate for the category of the business conducted for which the business organization is licensed. If any qualifying agent ceases to be affiliated with such business organization, he shall so inform the department. In addition, if such qualifying agent is the only qualified individual affiliated with the business organization, the business organization shall notify the department of the termination of the qualifying agent and shall have sixty (60) days from the termination of the qualifying agent's affiliation with the business organization in which to employ another qualifying agent. The business organization may not engage in the contracting until a qualifying agent is employed. 
(3)  The qualifying agent shall inform the department in writing when he proposes to engage in contracting in his own name or affiliation with another business organization, and he or such new business organization shall supply the same information to the department as required for qualifying any business organization. 
(4)  Upon a favorable determination by the board, after investigation of the financial responsibility, credit and business reputation of the qualifying agent and new business organization, the department shall issue, without an examination, a new certificate of competency in the qualifying agent's name and the name of the new business organization shall be noted thereon. 
(5)  If a qualifying agent for a business organization desires to qualify additional business organizations, the board shall require him to present evidence of ability and financial responsibility of each such organization. The issuance of additional certificates of competency is discretionary with the board. 
(6)  If a business organization or any of its partners, officers, directors, trustees, or members is fined for violation F.S. ch. 489, or is disciplined for violation of this chapter, or has committed an act within the last three (3) years which, if committed or done by a licensed contractor, would be grounds for suspension or revocation of the contractor's certificate of competency the Board may, on that basis alone, deny issuance of a certificate of competency to a qualifying agent on behalf of that business organization.

Sec. 150.512. - Qualifying agents; responsibilities. 
(1)  A qualifying agent is a primary qualifying agent unless he is a secondary qualifying agent under this section. All primary qualifying agents for a business organization are jointly and equally responsible for supervision of all operations or the business organization; for all field work at all sites; and for financial matters, both for the organization in general and for each specific job. 
(2)  One (1) of the qualifying agents for a business organization that has more than one (1) qualifying agent may be designated as the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization by a joint agreement that is executed by all qualifying agents for the business organization. The joint agreement must be submitted to the board for approval. If the board determines that the joint agreement is in good order, it shall approve the designation and immediately notify the qualifying agents of such approval. The designation made by the joint agreement is effective upon receipt of the notice by the qualifying agents. The qualifying agent designated for a business organization by joint agreement is the sole primary qualifying agent for the business organization, and all other qualifying agents for the business organization are secondary qualifying agents. 
(a)  A designated sole primary qualifying agent has all the responsibilities and duties of a primary qualifying agent, notwithstanding that there are secondary qualifying agents per specified jobs. The designated sole primary agent is jointly and equally responsible with the secondary qualifying for field supervision. 
(b)  A secondary qualifying agent is only responsible for: the supervision of field work at sites where his license was used to obtain the building permits; and any other work for which he accepts responsibility. A secondary qualifying agent is not responsible for supervision of financial matters. 
(c)  A qualifying agent who has been designated by a joint agreement as the sole primary qualifying agent for a business organization may terminate his status as such as giving actual notice to the business organization, to the board, and to all secondary qualifying agents of his intention to terminate his status. His notice to the board must include proof satisfactory to the board that he has given the notice required in this subsection (c). The status of the qualifying agent shall cease upon the designation of a new primary qualifying agent or sixty (60) days after satisfactory notice of termination has been provided to the board, whichever first occurs. If no new primary qualifying agent has been designated within sixty (60) days, all secondary qualifying agents for the business organization shall become primary qualifying agent unless the joint agreement specifies that one (1) or more of them shall become sole qualifying agents under such circumstances, in which case they shall become sole qualifying agents. 
(d)  Any change in the status of a qualifying agent is prospective only. A qualifying agent is not responsible for his predecessor's actions but is responsible, even after a change in status, for matters of which he was responsible while in a particular status.

(b)  Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state or the mayor, the building official shall conduct a damage assessment to determine the need for the initiation for emergency licensing procedures which would allow contractors to temporarily work within the city to rebuild, repair or assist in the rebuilding and repairing of the damage caused by the event. 
(c)  If deemed necessary due to the extent of damage caused by the event, the building official shall consult with the chairman of the city contractor's examining and licensing board, and with his concurrence, may temporarily suspend existing requirements for obtaining a local contractor's license and institute the following procedures: 
(1)  The building official shall honor, upon display, all current state certified contractor competency cards. 
(2)  The building official shall be authorized to issue temporary city competency cards to all existing St. Lucie County and City of Fort Pierce licensed contractors. 
(3)  The building official, or his designee, shall be authorized to issue temporary city competency cards to contractors or subcontractors from other jurisdictions, inside the state, whose licensing requirements are substantially comparable to the licensing requirements of the city. The burden of proving the similarity of the licensing requirements shall be on the contractor applying for a temporary competency card. 
(4)  Temporary competency cards issued by the building official pursuant to this procedure shall be valid for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days unless earlier revoked by the building official. 
(5)  Reserved. 
(6)  The issue of any temporary competency card and any subsequent regular competency card shall be contingent upon the payment of the appropriate application fees in effect at the date of application. 
(7)  The building official is authorized, at his discretion, to extend a temporary competency card for one (1) additional 120-day period.

(1)  Each contractor holding a certificate of competency issued by the City of Port St. Lucie shall be solely responsible for notifying the building department, in writing, of the contractor's current mailing address and phone number. If the mailing address is not the contractor's physical address, the contractor shall also supply the physical address. Such notification to the building department shall be by certified mail or in person, for which a receipt will be tendered. 
(2)  A contractor's failure to notify the building department of a change of address or phone number shall constitute a violation of this section. 
(3)  The contractor shall be responsible for retaining proof that the contractor has notified the building department of the contractor's current address of record. 
(4)  Unless otherwise provided by law, service by regular mail to a contractor's address of record shall constitute adequate and sufficient notice to the contractor by the board or the building department for all purposes under this Code. 
(5)  Except as otherwise provided by law, service by regular mail to a contractor, who is registered or certified with the Florida Construction Industry Licensing Board and subject to the provisions of F.S. § 489.124 at the contractor's address of record maintained with the Florida Department of Professional Regulation, shall constitute adequate and sufficient notice to the contractor by the board or the building department for all purposes under this Code.

Sec. 150.520.1. - Types of discipline. 
    An order of the board finding a respondent guilty of misconduct shall include one (1) or more of the following disciplinary measures: 
(a)  Reprimand. The board may order a reprimand for minor misconduct by a respondent. A reprimand shall state findings of the board that the conduct of the respondent, falls below the acceptable standards of conduct in the business of contracting but does not justify suspension or revocation of the competency card. A memorandum of such reprimand shall thereafter be made a part of the record of the proceedings and a part of the respondent's record maintained by the building department of the city. 
(b)  Suspension. The board may suspend the certificate of competency of the respondent for a definite period of time. During such suspension, the respondent shall not requalify to obtain a certificate of competency within the city. Upon the expiration of the suspension period and the satisfaction of all conditions accompanying the suspension, the respondent shall become eligible to apply for reinstatement of his certificate of competency. If any disciplinary actions(s) have resulted in a suspension of one hundred eighty (180) days, or longer, the application shall be subject to the same requirements as though the applicant were applying for an original certificate of competency, including the payment of fees. 
(c)  Revocation. The board may revoke the respondent's certificate of competency. No application for reinstatement or the issuance of a new certificate of competency may be accepted or considered by the board within five (5) years after the date of revocation. 
(d)  Other certificates. If the board suspends any certificate of competency held by any contractor it may, simultaneously, suspend or revoke any other certificate of competency issued by the city to that contractor. 
(e)  Work in progress. The board shall permit any disciplined contractor to complete projects for which a building permit has been issued, even though the competency card upon which said permit(s) was issued has been suspended or revoked.

The building official shall mail a copy of such charges to the respondent within fifteen (15) days from the receipt thereof. 
(b)  The building official, building official designee and the chairman of the board shall review the complaint for probable cause. If no probable cause is found, the complaint shall be denied and not referred to the board. A copy of the complaint and the findings of the building official and the chairman shall be placed in the respondent's file. The complainant or complaining witness shall have no right of appeal. Where a probable cause is found, the complaint shall be referred to the board for a hearing on the complaint. 
(c)  The proceedings of the board may be informal in nature and the board shall not be bound by the rules of evidence. The board shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as is regularly relied upon in the ordinary course of the conduct of business. 
(d)  The proceedings shall not be delayed, deferred or suspended without the approval of the board even though the respondent is made a party of civil litigation, or is a defendant or is acquitted in a criminal action, notwithstanding that either of such proceedings involves the subject matter of the investigation.

The respondent shall be given an opportunity to make a statement personally or by counsel, verbally or in writing, sworn or unsworn, explaining, refuting or admitting the alleged charges. The respondent shall be granted the right to be present at any hearing when evidence is to be presented to the contractors examining board and to call witnesses or present evidence and to cross-examine, subject to reasonable limitation. 
(f)  If the respondent admits to the alleged charges the board shall immediately make a finding of guilt without further testimony. If the respondent fails to appear, the board may make its determination of guilt based upon the sworn complaint. 
(g)  The complainant or complaining witness is not a party to the disciplinary proceeding. Unless found to be impractical by the chairman of the board due to unreasonable delay or other good cause, the complainant or complaining witness shall be granted the right to be present at any board hearing when evidence is to be presented, subject to reasonable limitations. The complainant or complaining witness shall have no right of appeal from the decision of the board. 
(h)  Upon conclusion of the formal hearing, the board shall make a determination of guilt. If the respondent is found to be guilty of misconduct by the board, the board shall thereupon enter its findings, an order of guilt and determine the proper disciplinary action to be imposed upon the respondent. 
(i)  If a complaint is brought against a respondent whose competency card is in a state of expiration, or expires prior to the hearing, the proceedings on the complaint shall be stayed. Provided, however, that the competency card may not be renewed, re-issued or activated until the board has disposed of the complaint.

Any decision of the Board imposing disciplinary action on a respondent may be appealed by the respondent to the city council within fifteen (15) days of the date of the board's decision; provided, however, a written notice of such appeal shall be filed with the city clerk within such a period of time. The city clerk shall notify all interested parties of the date fixed for hearing the appeal, which date shall be not less than thirty (30) days after the date of the filing of the notice of appeal. The hearing on appeal shall be, to the extent possible, upon the record and shall not be a hearing de novo. The council shall review the transcript of the hearing before the contractors examining board together with any tangible evidence considered by the board that determined its decision. The council may also entertain any additional testimony or evidence offered by the respondent or other interest party that was not brought out at the board hearing. 
(l)  Stay on appeal. Any decision of the board imposing disciplinary action upon a respondent, other than revocation, which has been appealed by the respondent shall be automatically stayed upon receipt of the written notice of appeal by the city clerk.

(2)  The contractor has abandoned a customer's job and the percentage of completion is less than the percentage of the total contract price paid to the contractor as of the time of abandonment, unless the contractor is entitled to retain such funds under the terms of the contract or refunds the excess funds within thirty (30) days after the date the job is abandoned; or 
(3)  The contractor's job has been completed, and it is shown that the customer has had to pay more for the contracted job than the original contract price, as adjusted for subsequent change orders, unless such increase in cost was the result of circumstances caused by the customer, or was otherwise permitted by the terms of the contract between the contractor and the customer. 
(g)  Substantial departure from, or disregard, of, plans or specifications without consent the owner or his duly authorized representative; 
(h)  Knowingly or deliberately disregarding or violating any applicable building codes or laws of the state, county or the city; 
(i)  Willfully and deliberately engaging in a type or class of contracting for which the contractor is not licensed or registered; 
(j)  Being disciplined by any other municipality or county; 
(k)  Failing to actively supervise construction projects for which the contractor has applied for and obtained a building permit; or for projects for which the contractor is, by contract, responsible; 
(l)  Contracting with persons or firms not having a certificate of competency issued by the city for work or services to be performed within the city when said persons or firms are required by this chapter to possess such a certificate of competency in order to perform the contracted work or services; and 
(m)  Proceeding on any job without obtaining the applicable building department permits and inspections. 
(n)  Being convicted or found guilty, regardless of adjudication, of a crime in any jurisdiction which directly relates to the practice of contracting or the ability to practice contracting. 
(o)  Knowingly combining or conspiring with an uncertified or unregistered person by allowing his certificate or registration to be used by the uncertified or unregistered person with intent to evade the provisions of this code. When a certificate holder or registrant allows his certificate or registration to be used by one (1) or more business organizations without having any active participation in the operations, management, or control of such business organizations, such act constitutes prima facie evidence of an intent to evade the provisions of this Code.

(1)  The enforcement authorities designated herein may issue a citation, as provided herein, for any violation of F.S. §§ 489.127(1) and 489.132(1) and Chapter 150 of this Code, whenever, based upon personal investigation, the enforcement officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that such a violation has occurred.

CHAPTER 152. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 19-23, § 2, adopted April 22, 2019, repealed the former Ch. 152, §§ 152.00-152.12, 152.99 and enacted a new Ch. 152 as set out herein. The former Ch. 152 pertained to floodplain regulations and derived from Ord. No. 12-06, 2-13-12. 

ARTICLE I. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 152.00. - General. 
(a)  Title. This chapter shall be known as the Floodplain Management Regulations. 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code ; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code . The Floodplain Management Regulations are intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code . Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by the Floodplain Management Regulations and the Florida Building Code , as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

CHAPTER 154. - LANDSCAPE AND LAND CLEARING CODE 

Sec. 154.01. - Purpose and intent. 
(A)  This article is intended to improve and protect the environment and the value and the character of the community and properties by providing for the installation and maintenance of landscaping and the preservation of natural plant growth. The provision for landscaping and the retention of natural plant growth reduces erosion, provides shade, buffers incompatible uses, aids in urban temperature control, and improves the aesthetic quality of a community and properties, thereby promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare. This chapter requires specific water conservation measures including the preservation of native vegetation for landscaping purposes, where applicable, to minimize water use, conserve energy, limit nutrient loading to surface waters, and provide mature vegetation for aesthetics, shade and wildlife habitat. The specific objectives of these regulations are to: preserve and protect existing vegetation, promote water conservation, and encourage greater use of native cold-tolerant and drought-tolerant landscape material. 
(B)  The standards established in this chapter are to be considered the minimum requirements and shall apply to all areas of the city. The Site Plan Review Committee, Planning & Zoning Board, and/or the City Council may from time to time require, as a part of site plan approval, more stringent requirements on landscaping for a particular site plan. 
(C)  Landscape guidelines which preempt this chapter may be adopted by the City Council for certain areas of the city. 
(D)  Administrative amendments to approved Site Plans pursuant to §158.237(K) shall not be required to provide a landscape plan unless the proposed amendment would substantially affect the approved landscape plan.

5.  Drainage Easement Landscaping. Landscaping may encroach a maximum of ten (10) feet into a twenty (20) foot drainage easement, provided that: 
1)  The applicant demonstrates that the site development requirements constrain the site; and 
2)  The presence of the landscaping does not impede access, maintenance activities, or interfere with the operation of the City's drainage infrastructure as determined by the City Engineer; and 
3)  The owner completes a Revocable Encroachment Permit. 
a.  The perimeter wall can be located within a twenty (20) foot drainage easement provided that: 
1)  The applicant demonstrates that the site development requirements constrain the site; and 
2)  The presence of the wall does not impede access, maintenance activities, or interfere with the operation of the City's drainage infrastructure as determined by the City Engineer; and 
3)  The owner completes a Revocable Encroachment Permit. 
b.  Landscaping and/or walls located in a drainage easement will require the owner to complete a Revocable Encroachment Permit. This permit shall be requested during the site plan review process and completed prior to issuance of the engineering permit for site work. The permit allows the placement of the wall and landscaping within the easement; however, if needed, the City will be allowed access to the easement for access, maintenance, making improvements to the drainage system, or installing new drainage facilities. In the event that the landscape buffer impedes the City's access, the owner will be responsible for the cost to remove and replace the wall and/or landscaping upon completion of the drainage work by the City. 
(J)  Certification by Landscape Architect. The landscape architect shall certify in writing to the Director of Planning and Zoning that the landscaping and irrigation have been installed in accordance with the landscaping and irrigation plans approved by the Site Plan Review Committee. No certificates of occupancy or similar authorization will be issued unless the certification has been received verifying the landscaping and irrigation meet the requirements provided herein, and are in conformance with the approved landscape and irrigation plans for the project. This requirement shall not apply to single-family homes. 
(K)  Other Areas. All property, except for land utilized for principal structures, accessory structures, off-street parking areas, other vehicular use areas, and required landscaped areas shall be landscaped with at least grass, ground cover, or mulch.

(M)  Preservation of Existing Non-Exotic Vegetation. Preservation of existing non-exotic vegetation shall be required whenever possible since this plant material is known to adapt to soil and climate conditions that occur in the city area. Existing trees and vegetation may satisfy the landscape buffer requirements in this chapter, in total, or in part provided it is of a quality comparable to Florida No. 1 as given in "Grade and Standards for Nursery Plants", State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, Trees to be preserved shall be protected by a root barrier (See Appendix D - Tree Protection Barrier Detail). 
(N)  Building Area Increase. When the building area on a developed site is increased by more than 500 square feet, the landscaping on the site shall conform to current code as much as reasonably possible. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.04. - Landscape material standards. 
    The following shall be considered minimum standards for all landscape materials: 
(A)  Plant Materials. Plant material used in conformance with the provisions of this chapter shall conform to the most recent standards for Florida No. 1 or better as given in "Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants", State of Florida, Department of Agriculture, or equal thereto. Trees and plants used in a required landscape design shall be cold-tolerant, drought-tolerant, or appropriate for the environmental setting in which they are to be planted. The "Waterwise South Florida Landscapes" plant guide, published by the South Florida Water Management District, as amended, should be used to determine appropriate vegetation. Plant materials which are known to be intolerant of paving environments or temperature below 32° F or 0° C, or whose physical characteristics may be injurious to the public or which produce a quantity and/or quality of debris so as to present maintenance difficulties shall not be specified for use under this chapter. 
(B)  Florida Friendly or Xeriscape plant materials. Florida Friendly or Xeriscape landscaping means a type of quality landscaping that conserves water and protects the environment by using site appropriate plants, an efficient watering system, proper planning and design, soil analysis, practical use of turf, the use of mulches, and proper maintenance. The intent is to establish and maintain a healthy landscape by matching the right plants with existing site conditions to minimize the use of additional resources, such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides. A Florida Friendly or Xeriscape plan may be approved by the site plan review committee when the applicant can assure the health and survivability of all landscaping plant materials. Plant materials shall be approved native and suitable non-native trees, shrubs, and ground covers that require minimal maintenance when planted under appropriate conditions. Appendix D: City of Port St. Lucie Suggested Tree List and the South Florida Water Management District "Waterwise South Florida Landscapes" plant guide shall be used as a guide for choosing plant materials. 
(C)  Trees. 
1.  Trees shall be a species having an average mature spread of crown greater than 20 feet. Trees shall have a trunk that is maintained in a clean condition with over five feet of clear wood (no branches). 
2.  Tree species shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet overall height when planted with a minimum five (5) foot crown spread. At planting, the trees shall have a caliper of at least 2.5 inches. Palm trees shall have a minimum clear trunk height of ten (10) feet except for Canary Island Date Palm, Edible Date Palm, and Bismark Palm. Canary Island Date Palm, Edible Date Palm, and Bismark Palm shall have a minimum clear trunk height of six (6) feet. For the requirements of Section 154.03(C)(2) "Landscaping around Building Façade", the minimum height may be reduced to eight (8) feet. Required trees may be selected from Appendix C: City of Port St. Lucie Suggested Tree List located at the end of this chapter and/or the "Waterwise South Florida Landscapes" plant guide, published by the South Florida Water Management District provided the trees are of the appropriate USDA plant hardiness zone and ecological setting. Additional tree species may be considered based upon certification from a Florida registered landscape architect as to appropriate USDA plant hardiness zone and ecological setting. Smaller trees having an average mature spread of crown less than 20 feet may be arranged in groupings or clumps of two (2) or more so as to create the equivalent of a 20-foot crown spread; however, the grouping or groupings shall count as one (1) tree. Substitutions do not apply to certain portions of this chapter which identify specific planting requirements. The requirement for smaller trees to be planted in clumps of two or more so as to create the equivalent of a 20-foot crown spread does not apply to building façade landscaping or landscaping below overhead power lines. 
3.  No species designated as Category 1 on the Exotic Plant Pest Council's most recent list of "Florida's Most Invasive Species," shall be used to meet the requirements of this section. 
4.  No more than twenty-five (25) percent of required trees shall be palm trees. The building façade landscape strip is exempt from this requirement. 
5.  At least fifty (50) percent of all required trees shall be native species.

(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
ARTICLE II. - TREE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION 

Sec. 154.13. - Legislative intent. 
(A)  In recognizing that trees provide a meaningful contribution to a healthy, beautiful, and safer community attributable to their carbon dioxide absorption, oxygen production, dust filtration, wind and noise reduction, soil erosion prevention, wildlife habitat, surface drainage improvement, beautification and aesthetic enhancement of improved and vacant lands, and recognizing that most species of trees require at least two decades of growth to begin to exhibit such beneficial qualities, it is the intent of this article to establish policies, regulations, and standards necessary to ensure that the city, which has been declared a "Tree City USA" community, will continue to realize the benefits provided by its urban forest. 
(B)  To achieve the objectives listed above, the city deems it necessary to provide for the protection and preservation of trees, to prevent the reduction of the existing tree canopy, and to prevent the unnecessary removal of trees and other native vegetation. The provisions of this chapter are enacted to: 
1.  Provide standards for the protection of trees as part of the land development process; 
2.  Prevent large-scale land clearing without provision for the preservation of protected trees; 
3.  Provide for the replacement of tree canopy removed as a result of the construction process; and 
4.  Preserve the community's character and quality of life well into the future. 
(C)  Purpose. It is the objective of this article to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare through Tree Protection and to promote the findings of this article by following the guidelines contained herein. 
(D)  Applicability. This article applies to protected trees on public and private property. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.14. - Permit required for tree removal. 
(A)  Trees requiring tree removal permits. Except as provided for in the article, no person shall, directly or indirectly, cut down, substantially alter, destroy, remove, relocate, damage, or authorize any such act involving a protected tree situated on land within the city, without first obtaining a tree removal permit. The term "protected tree" shall apply to any tree having a D.B.H. of 12 inches or greater, any replacement tree, and any tree that is represented in a landscape plan, street tree planting plan, or other planning document for the purposes of securing an approved building permit, clearing permit, or certificate of occupancy. 
Exceptions are as follows: 
1.  Platted single-family lots are exempt from the preservation requirements of this article as long as the minimum landscaping requirements, as may be required by this chapter, are met and maintained. Preserved trees may be substituted for tree planting required by the landscaping section of this Code. 
2.  Any tree located in botanical gardens or in state-approved or government nurseries and groves which are grown for sale or public purpose. 
3.  Non-native fruit trees cultivated or grown for the specific purpose of producing edible fruit, including, but not limited to: mangos, avocados, or species of citrus. 
4.  No permit shall be required to remove non-native invasive or undesirable species listed under Section 154.03(L). 
5.  Any property subject to the upland habitat preservation requirements of the Natural Resources Code that is providing on site or off site upland habitat preservation and/or mitigation. 
6.  Preserve and Parks Management Activities. No permit shall be required for tree removal associated with an adopted management plan for government maintained or privately maintained parks, recreation areas, wildlife management areas, conservation areas, and preserves. The purpose of the tree removal activity shall be to protect and preserve the natural values and functions of the ecological communities present, such as, clearing for firebreaks, conducting prescribed burns, or construction of fences. The Zoning Administrator shall be notified in advance of any clearing of native vegetation on a site. 
7.  Utility companies authorized to provide utility service may remove protected tree(s) that endanger public safety and welfare by interfering with utility service in an existing utility easement or public right-of-way, provided work is done by or under the control of the operating utility company and said company has received all necessary licenses or permits to provide utility service within the easement. 
8.  Any activity conducted by a lawfully operating and bona fide commercial nursery or agricultural operation, when the activity occurs on property owned or lawfully occupied by the person conducting such activity. 
9.  Pruning and trimming of trees or other vegetation when necessary to conduct a survey or site examination for the preparation of subdivision plats, site plans, or tree surveys, providing that such pruning and trimming is conducted under the direction of a Florida registered surveyor or engineer. 
10.  Routine landscape maintenance such as limited trimming or pruning of vegetation that is not intended to result in the eventual death of the plant, or any other landscaping activity which is commonly recognized as routine maintenance. 
(B)  During the period of an emergency such as a hurricane, flood, or any other natural disaster, the requirements of this chapter may be temporarily waived by the City Manager, so that private or public work to restore order in the city will in no way be hampered. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.15. - Permit procedure and criteria for issuing permits. 
(A)  Permits for the removal or relocation of a protected tree shall be obtained by filing an application with the Planning and Zoning Department. Approval of the application and issuance of a tree removal permit shall be required prior to any land clearing or grubbing, prior to any disturbance of the root system or site development, or prior to the occurrence of any changes to an existing developed site. When a development order is issued for a site plan, subdivision application, or a landscape modification application, a separate tree removal permit shall not be required if the trees to be removed are identified and mitigated on the approved landscape plan. 
(B)  No tree removal permit shall be issued unless the Zoning Administrator finds that at least one of the following criteria is satisfied with respect to each protected tree designated for removal: 
1.  The tree is located within the net buildable area of a given site as identified on the tree survey and site plan by the applicant. 
2.  The tree is located within an existing or proposed right-of-way. 
3.  The tree is located within an existing or proposed easement, stormwater management tract or facility, provided that only the minimum area reasonably necessary for the service or use shall be considered for purposes of determining whether there is necessity for tree removal. 
4.  The tree is located where it creates or will create a safety or health hazard or a nuisance with respect to existing or proposed structures or vehicles or pedestrian routes and there is no reasonable alternative to relocate or reconfigure the improvements. The Zoning Administrator or City Arborist may require verification of claim(s) be provided by a statement from a certified engineer or certified arborist in the State of Florida. 
5.  The tree is located where it interferes with the installation, delivery, or maintenance of proposed or existing utility services to the site. 
6.  The tree is confirmed by the Zoning Administrator, City Arborist, or by a certified arborist to be diseased, severely injured, or in danger of falling. 
7.  The tree unreasonably prevents development of a lot or parcel of the physical use thereof. However, a tree removal permit shall not be granted where the applicant has failed to design and locate the proposed improvements so as to minimize the removal of trees consistent with the permitted use of the lot or parcel under the zoning ordinance as amended. 
8.  For criteria 4, 5, and 6, the Zoning Administrator may allow the protected tree to be replaced with one tree meeting the minimum requirements of the City Code when no feasible alternative other than removal of such tree exists. Trees may be selected from Appendix C: City of Port St. Lucie Suggested Tree List located at the end of this chapter and/or the "Waterwise South Florida Landscapes" plant guide, published by the South Florida Water Management District, provided the trees are of the appropriate USDA plant hardiness zone and ecological setting. Additional tree species may be considered based upon certification from a Florida registered landscape architect as to appropriate USDA plant hardiness zone and ecological setting. 
(C)  In lieu of submitting a tree removal permit application, an applicant may submit a no tree verification statement stating that no trees protected by this article exist on site. If such statement is verified by the Zoning Administrator (or Zoning Administrator designee), no permit will be required. 
(D)  Tree removal applications for trees located on 'common' property must be accompanied by a letter from the Board of Directors of the Homeowner's Association indicating it was the consensus of the Board that the tree be removed. 
(E)  Inspections. An application for a tree removal permit constitutes consent by the property owner and/or applicant for the City to conduct site inspections on the subject property, pursuant to permit requirements. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.16. - Tree protection and mitigation. 
(A)  Any tree removal permit shall require a mitigation plan. Any replacement trees that are the subject of such mitigation shall be planted, relocated, or preserved before issuance of a certificate of occupancy or similar authorization. Replacement trees meet the minimum requirements of this Chapter. Mitigation shall be as follows: 
1.  Replacement trees shall be in addition to the minimum landscape requirements set out in this article. 
2.  Any tree which is the subject of a mitigation plan shall be replaced at a ratio of one inch D.B.H. for each inch of D.B.H. removed. The following mitigation credit shall apply: 
a.  Trees preserved or relocated on-site shall count as equivalent replacement D.B.H. 
b.  Trees planted on-site shall count as one-half (1/2) credit towards the mitigation requirements. 
(B)  A tree location survey, prepared by a registered land surveyor, professional engineer, registered forester, certified arborist, or landscape architect, identifying all existing trees with a D.B.H. of 12 inches or greater is required for all development applications and shall be included with any site plan, subdivision, application, clearing plan, or similar authorization. A tree survey may be required as part of an application for PUD zoning at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. This tree location survey drawing shall be overlaid directly upon the site plan or subdivision application sufficiently to provide the accurate location of all existing trees which are proposed to be destroyed, relocated, or preserved, the botanical name, and common name of each tree, and the diameter (to the nearest half inch at 4.5 feet above ground), height and canopy spread of each tree. If existing trees are to be transplanted, the proposed relocation for such trees shall be shown on the drawing, together with a statement as to how such trees are to be protected during land clearing and construction and maintained after construction shall be included. The survey shall also include a statement indicating how trees not proposed for removal or relocation are to be protected during land clearing and construction, if applicable. The number of trees to be retained, relocated, removed, and the new trees to be replanted by diameter to the nearest half inch shall be shown in tabular form. 
(C)  The replanting design shall provide adequate space for root and crown development. 
(D)  The property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the mitigation trees, such responsibility to include replacement of unhealthy and dead trees. The property owner shall submit to an on-site inspection of the planted/preserved vegetation twelve (12) months after the issuance of the final development order or permit approval. If it is determined that the planted vegetation is dead, diseased, or otherwise not in compliance with provisions of this Code and the original approved mitigation plan, the property owner shall be provided notice and directed to correct any such deficiencies and replace all non-compliant materials within sixty (60) days. 
(E)  Tree Preservation Fund. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator, or the Zoning Administrator's designee, that the site is not suitable for on-site mitigation or does not have the capacity to hold all of the required mitigation, then the applicant may contribute a fee established by the City Council by resolution per inch D.B.H. required for mitigation, to be used by the city to enhance tree canopy coverage. Tree preservation funds shall be expended, utilized and disbursed for the acquisition, maintenance, and planting of trees on publicly owned lands and any other ancillary costs associated with the planting of trees on public lands. Ancillary costs shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the cost of the particular tree planting project and may include landscape design services, irrigation, mulch, root barriers, tree grates, or other materials necessary or the proper installation and maintenance of tree planting projects. This fund may also be used for the relocation of trees to public lands and for periodically distributing saplings to the public to increase tree canopy coverage in association with the City's Keep Port St. Lucie Beautiful tree giveaway program. Any such monies contributed in satisfaction of the applicant's mitigation requirement shall be placed in a specially designated fund titled "The City of Port St. Lucie Tree Preservation Fund", the use of which must be consistent with this article. 
(F)  Parking Space Reduction to Protect Existing Trees. A ten (10) percent reduction in the number of required parking spaces on the site shall be allowed to the extent that the reduction in the amount of required pavement will preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed, natural condition. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into consideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use. This reduction is discretionary and subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator. 
(G)  Building Setback Reduction to Protect Existing Trees. Upon the request of the applicant, the Zoning Administrator may permit the applicant to obtain up to a ten (10) foot reduction in front or rear setback requirements when this would be sufficient to protect an existing tree as determined by a certified arborist or landscape architect. To qualify for this exception, the tree(s) shall be at least twelve (12) inches in diameter, measured four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. The tree must also be in a condition and location such that it will not present a hazard to life or property following site development, and can be expected to remain healthy for at least twenty years as determined by a certified arborist or landscape architect. A reduction in the setback requirement shall be authorized only when all the following facts and conditions are found to exist: 
1.  The applicable yard setback requirements would make it impossible to protect existing tree(s) without causing undue hardship; and 
2.  The requested yard reduction does not go beyond the minimum necessary to protect the tree(s) as determined by a certified arborist or other tree professional; and 
3.  The yard reduction will not result in a development that is materially detrimental to the character and design of the surrounding area. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.17. - Penalties. 
(A)  If protected trees are removed without a permit or otherwise in violation of this chapter, the number of replacement trees shall be up to three times the amount for every offense and the applicant shall be charged twice the normal application fee for tree removal. Each tree removed in violation of this article or any permit issued pursuant to this article shall constitute a separate violation. Remedial action shall be taken to restore the property consistent with a restoration plan approved by the Zoning Administrator or payment into the city tree fund in an amount equal to the cost of the three (3) to one (1) ratio. No certificate of occupancy or similar authorization shall be issued for any development until all applicable permits or restoration plan conditions have been accomplished. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.18. - Alternative compliance. 
(A)  An applicant may submit a landscape plan which varies from the strict application of the requirements of this chapter in order to accommodate unique site features or utilize innovative design. An alternative compliance landscape plan shall be approved only upon a finding that it fulfills the purpose and intent of this article as well as or more effectively than would adherence to the strict requirements of this chapter. 
(B)  Evaluation. In evaluating proposed alternative compliance landscape plans, consideration shall be given to proposals which preserve native vegetation and use drought-tolerant plantings and other low water use landscape design principles and where the design may accomplish one or more of the following: 
1.  Ensures preservation of the maximum predevelopment vegetation on the site; and 
2.  Is designed to assure that the overall appearance and function of the proposed project is compatible with other properties in the immediate area; is demonstrably responsive to the environmental attributes of soil, slope, hydrology, and vegetative communities unique to the site; is consistent with sound planning and site design principles, and contingent upon: 
a.  Structures and other improvements are designed as to utilize existing site characteristics of topography, existing vegetative communities, and any unique environmental feature; 
b.  Conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian circulation are avoided; 
c.  Planting plans indicate a diversity of plant species in the categories of ground covers, shrubs, and trees; 
d.  Integration of proposed and existing vegetation is demonstrated in the plans with an emphasis on maintaining native community buffers and corridors, preserving or restoring forest community types, and providing for the natural ecological function of each type by using such techniques as preserving a diversity of upper story, mid-story, and understory; 
e.  Plant schedules contain botanical and common names, sizes of materials by dimension and container size, location by dimension, and notation describing species diversity; 
f.  Planting specifications and species selected for the site are suitable for individual site environmental characteristics of soil slope, aspect, wetness and microclimate; and 
g.  Plans indicate compatibility with adjacent site environmental features.

(A)  It is the intent of this article to provide for and encourage the preservation of existing tree canopy and other vegetation, wherever practicable, during any land clearing or development within the city. In retaining existing tree canopy and other vegetation, aesthetics are improved, soil erosion is reduced, groundwater is increased, air is purified and air temperature is modified, thus contributing to the public health and general welfare of the community. In areas where preservation is considered unfeasible, planting or seeding by artificial means will aid in the above mentioned advantages for the public good. 
(B)  Additionally, this article provides for the regulation of stormwater discharges from cleared areas and/or construction sites through the implementation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. Stormwater discharge regulation will contribute to the public health and general welfare of the community and environment by minimizing the likelihood of harmful pollutants from washing into local surface waters. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.21. - [Definitions.] 
    See Chapter 153. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.22. - General requirements. 
(A)  The provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the protection and promotion of the public health, safety, or general welfare. Whenever the requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions, or covenants, the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standards shall govern. 
(B)  Any development that disturbs one acre or more is required to have an approved land clearing plan, SWPPP, and clearing permit prior to clearing or developing the land. 
(C)  Any operation that disturbs one acre or more or is part of a common plan of development that will disturb one acre or more will be required to make an application for an NPDES generic permit for stormwater discharge from large and small construction activity by completing an NOI and submitting to FDEP. 
(D)  While a site is being cleared and/or developed, BMPs shall be installed to prevent or reduce pollution of non-point sources from entering the City's stormwater system and/or state surface waters as required by NPDES and other regulations. If the installed BMPs are deemed insufficient, or found to be failing, adjustments to the BMPs must be made to remedy the failure in a timely manner, but no later than seven days after notice. 
(E)  All development shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 157, Natural Resource Protection. A site survey for gopher tortoises shall be conducted on all properties having native upland vegetation. If gopher tortoises are identified on the property, then the property must also be surveyed for listed species associated with gopher tortoise burrows. A general survey for listed plant species may also be required depending on the characteristics of the site. No land clearing permit shall be issued for any land containing or adjacent to wetlands, containing listed plant or animal species, or for parcels greater than or equal to two acres in size until an environmental site assessment has been submitted and approved by the City. Upland preservation requirements shall not be applicable to any lot or parcel under two acres in size. 
(F)  A land clearing permit does not authorize the damage, removal, relocation, or destruction of protected trees. No land clearing permit shall be issued when protected trees exist on the property until a tree preservation/mitigation plan has been approved by the City. Land clearing permits shall only be issued after all landscape, natural resource protection, NPDES, and drainage requirements have been addressed. 
(G)  The clearing of platted single-family parcels bordering on waterways of the North Fork of the St. Lucie River shall require a plot plan, erosion control plan, and clearing permit as stipulated in Ordinance 81-17. A 15-foot native vegetation buffer shall be preserved or provided along the mean high water line as a means to deter shoreline erosion. For these parcels, the residential plot plan survey shall also show the 15-foot buffer in addition to the requirements outlined in §150.404. The residential plot plans shall be submitted to the Engineering Department for review. 
(H)  Approved DRI or PUD. Grading and excavation of roads, stormwater lakes, and drainage canals/ditches that are identified on an approved DRI or PUD master plan shall be permitted provided the applicant has obtained appropriate SFWMD and USACE permits, SWPPP, mass grading plan, City approval of the environmental site assessment report, obtained the clearing permit from the city and the applicant acknowledges that such activities shall be at the applicant's own risk prior to final development plan approval. 
(I)  Exceptions. It shall be unlawful to clear any lot located within the City without first having obtained a valid building permit, a land clearing permit, or similar authorization except for the following activities: 
1.  Maintenance of roads, drainage ditches, and swales located in platted or dedicated public or private rights-of-way, and utility or drainage easements. 
2.  Minimal clearing of lines less than 10-feet wide for surveying purposes, to install sediment and erosion control measures. 
3.  Minimal clearing for the maintenance of property access and for minor recreational pursuits such as fishing, nature trails, boardwalks, and wildlife observation: 5-feet maximum trail width. 
4.  All plant or tree nurseries and commercial timber operations shall be exempt from the terms and provisions of this article in relation to those trees planted or growing on their premises which are so planted or growing for the sale or intended sale to the general public or in the ordinary course of the grower's commercial business. 
5.  Removal of exotic invasive vegetation listed under Section 154.03(M). 
(J)  Unless exempted under §154.22 (I), all land clearing activities shall be associated with an active development order such as an approved site plan, subdivision plat, or building permit and shall occur in conjunction with the construction phase of the project. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.23. - Land clearing plan. 
(A)  Any project that disturbs one acre or more is required to have a land clearing plan and SWPPP prior to clearing or development of the property. The process for submittal and review of the plans shall be in accordance with the site plan review requirements set forth in the Zoning Code. 
(B)  The required information for the clearing plan and SWPPP is provided in the Engineering Design Standards for Land Development. 
(C)  Standards for review. In review of the land clearing plans, mass grading plan, and SWPPP, the Site Plan Review Committee should consider the following: 
1.  The preservation of existing tree canopy, upland habitat, wetland communities, and other vegetation (excluding exotic species) to the maximum extent possible. 
2.  The applicant's method for protecting vegetation to be retained or preserved during and after the land clearing process. 
3.  SWPPP compliance with Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) guidelines. 
4.  Provision of appropriate BMPs to reduce or prevent pollution from leaving the site. 
5.  Stabilization of the disturbed areas. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.24. - Land clearing permit. 
(A)  Any project that disturbs one acre or more is required to have a land clearing permit prior to clearing or development of the property.

(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.26. - Appeal of decisions of committee. 
    If the land clearing permit is denied, the property owner may appeal to the City Council. These appeals shall be initiated by filing with the City Clerk a Notice of Appeal within thirty (30) days of the denial. The City Council shall, within thirty (30) days of receiving such Notice of Appeal, schedule a hearing on the same and, after hearing, may deny, approve, or modify the clearing plan by majority vote. 
(Ord. No. 15-70, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 154.27. - Penalty. 
    Whoever violates Chapter 154, Article III Land Clearing by clearing land for which a land clearing permit is required without having first obtained that permit, or violates any conditions of an applicable permit, or by clearing land in violation of §154.22 (I) and (J), shall be required to mitigate for the cleared area by paying a fee that will be deposited into the conservation trust for upland preserve, if applicable, or the tree preservation fund, if applicable, and/or may be required to reforest the property where deemed necessary. The following provisions shall apply: 
(A)  If protected trees are removed from the site, each tree shall constitute a separate violation. 
(B)  When land has been cleared in violation of applicable upland preservation requirements, mitigation, in the form of restoration, set aside of substitute native habitat, and/or payment of a fee into the Conservation Trust Fund, shall be required. Mitigation shall be based on a 4:1 ratio: four acres shall be mitigated for every one acre cleared. In lieu of paying a mitigation fee, the Planning and Zoning Department may require that illegally removed vegetation be replanted where having a vegetation buffer is vital to the public interest or the environment. The following provisions shall apply to the reforestation of cleared areas: 
1.  Vegetation. 
a.  Trees. For every one acre of land, forty (40) canopy trees that are the same or similar to the native upland tree species found in the near vicinity shall be provided. Two (2) palm trees or understory trees may be substituted for one canopy tree. Palm trees may be substituted for twenty (20) percent or fewer of the canopy trees and understory trees may be substituted for an additional twenty (20) percent or fewer of the canopy trees. One-third of the trees shall be at least eight (8), twelve (12), and fourteen (14) feet in height respectively at the time of planting. All palms shall be at least eight (8) feet in clear trunk height. 
b.  Shrubs. For every one acre of land, 200 shrubs that are the same or similar to the native upland shrub species found in the near vicinity shall be provided. Shrubs shall be at least two (2) feet in height at the time of planting.

Sec. 155.01. - Purpose; Intent. 
(A)  The City recognizes and affirms that persons and entities have an interest in communicating commercial and non-commercial speech through the use of signs. It is the intent of this chapter to provide uniform sign criteria which regulates the size, height, and placement of signs within the City and thereby promote and protect the public health, safety, general welfare, and aesthetics of the City. 
(B)  It is intended, among other things, to avoid excessive visual clutter, distractions or hazards for pedestrians and vehicles. Therefore, the display of signs should be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and be adequate, but not excessive, for the intended purpose of identification. 
(C)  It is further intended to enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community, preserve the scenic and natural beauty of the City, and prevent interference with the intended use of public property and rights- of-way. 
(D)  Additionally, this chapter is intended to provide for the safety and general welfare of the traveling public by reducing distractions, interference with line of sight, and encroachment into clear zones.

Sec. 155.03. - Sign Regulation Procedures. 
    All signs erected, replaced, or relocated on any property shall conform with the provisions of this sign code and with all other applicable codes of the city. Any sign which could fall into more than one category of signs shall be classified within the most restrictive category possible. Anything not addressed in the code is prohibited, unless specifically addressed in a Master Sign Program. Anything not addressed in the code may be presented to the Planning and Zoning Director for review. 
(A)  Administration of sign permit applications and fees. The building and/or the planning and zoning departments are responsible for administering sign permit applications for permanent signs. An application and fee shall be submitted first to the planning and zoning department. The format of the application shall be as provided by the building department. Additional fees will be required by the building department at the time of permitting. 
(1)  Sign applications. The application format for a sign permit shall fully describe the following information: 
(a)  Name, address, email address, and telephone number of the licensed sign contractor and the business owner. 
(b)  Written statement signed by the landowner, authorizing the placement of the proposed sign on the premises. 
(c)  Location of building (or structure) and lot to which or upon which the sign is to be placed and/or maintained. 
(d)  Position of the sign in relation to lot lines, nearby buildings or structures, sidewalks, streets and intersections. All freestanding monument signs must be shown on site plan. 
(e)  Type of sign and general description of design and materials to be used. 
(f)  Two prints of drawings of the plans which shall contain dimensions of sign structure, sign copy/letters (smallest and largest), and sign logo and/or pictorial designs. Façade signs will include height of sign, linear footage of business, and square footage of sign area. Monument signs will include linear frontage of property, address location and dimensions on sign, dimensions of sign panel/s, and will need to be shown on an approved site plan. Once sign area is approved, square footage and location cannot change without a new sign application. 
(g)  A statement indicating whether the sign is illuminated and whether the illumination is direct or indirect. 
(h)  A layout with sign colors shown or specified. 
(i)  Two prints of signed and sealed engineered drawings of sign specifications. The specifications concerning structural details of the methods of sign construction and installation shall show dimensions, elevations, means of support, method of illumination and any other significant engineering aspect of the proposed sign. 
(j)  NOTE: The structure of a monument sign is separate and distinct to the sign to which is attached to it. The structure must be approved and permitted by the building department prior to submitting an application for the monument sign. If the monument is not shown on the site plan a compliance form must be filed. 
(2)  Review of application for completeness. The planning and zoning department and the building department shall review each application to assure that each application is complete. If the application is complete it shall be submitted through the review process. If the application is not complete the planning and zoning department and/or the building department shall return it to the applicant. 
(B)  Sign plan review. All permanent signs shall receive plan approval by the planning and zoning and building departments. The planning and zoning department shall review each sign application for compliance with criteria established herein and the building department shall review application documents which illustrate construction, design and electrical work for compliance with the current building codes. 
(C)  Permitting procedure. No sign which requires a permit shall be erected, replaced, reconstructed, structurally altered, expanded, relocated, or used without securing a permit from the Building Department. No permit shall be required on a mere change of copy on a changeable copy sign. No permit shall be required for a change in a tenant panel on an existing permitted sign; however, the tenant panels shall conform to code and must be reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning department. 
(1)  Determination of allowable sign area. In determining the allowable sign area pursuant to this chapter, the area of a sign shall include the entire area within a circle, rectangle, or triangle enclosing the extreme limits of writing, representation, or character, together with any frame or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed; excluding the necessary supports or uprights on which such sign is placed. 
(a)  Where a sign has two or more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign, except that where two such signs share identical dimensions, are placed back to back, and are parallel to one another, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of one face. 
(b)  Where a sign consists solely of lettering or other sign elements printed or mounted on a wall, window, or door of a building without any distinguishing border, panel or background, such lettering and sign elements shall be treated as a single sign for purposes of area computation. 
(2)  Approval required prior to receipt of permit. No sign permit requiring a plan review shall be issued until the sign application and plan have been reviewed and approved for building code compliance by the building department and sign code compliance by the planning and zoning department. 
(3)  Changes to the name of a building identification on an existing permitted monument sign shall be reviewed and considered for approval by the planning and zoning department. 
(D)  Reserved. 
(E)  Inspections. The building department shall inspect each sign or advertising structure within the city's limits to determine the sign's compliance with this chapter as they deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare. An inspection fee to be determined by resolution of the city council will be paid by the owner or lessee for each sign inspected, excluding signs exempted from the permitting procedure and temporary signs. 
(F)  Revocation of permits. The building department may revoke a permit approval, issued under this section, if it is found that there has been any intentional or unintentional false statement, concealment or misrepresentation concerning any fact submitted in the application or plans on which the permit approval was based. A permit may also be revoked upon failure of the permit holder to comply with any provision of this section. 
(G)  Reserved.

ARTICLE V. - OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 156.070. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to make sure a pro rata share allocation of the costs for off-site improvements necessitated by new development. 
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.071. - Definition and Principles. 
    As a condition of final subdivision plat approval, the City Council may require the applicant to pay a pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary circulation improvements and water, sewage, drainage facilities and other improvements, including land and easements, located off-site of the property limits of the subdivision but necessitated or required by the development. "Necessary" improvements are those clearly and substantially related to the development in question. The City Council shall provide in its resolution of approval the basis of the required improvements. The capacity and design of proposed improvements shall be based upon the adopted master plans and Comprehensive Plan of the City. The proportionate or pro rata amount of the cost of such facilities within a related or common area shall be based on the following criteria. 
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.072. - Cost Allocation. 
(A)  Full Allocation. In cases where off-site improvements are required as a result of the proposed development, and where no other property owner(s) receive(s) a special benefit, the applicant may be required at his sole expense and as a condition of approval, to provide and install such improvements. 
(B)  Proportionate Allocation. Where it is determined that properties outside the development will also be benefited by the off-site improvement, the following criteria shall be utilized in determining the proportionate share of the cost of such improvements to the developer. 
(1)  Roadways. The applicant's proportionate share of street improvements, alignment, channelization, barriers, new or improved traffic signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility improvements not covered elsewhere, the construction of new or existing streets, and other associated street or traffic improvements shall be as follows: 
(a)  The Director of Planning and Zoning or the City Engineer shall provide the applicant with the existing and reasonably anticipated future peak-hour flows for the offsite improvements; 
(b)  If the existing system does not have adequate capacity as defined above, the pro rata share shall be computed as follows: 
Developer's cost Development peak-hour traffic to be accommodated by enlargement or improvement _____= _____Total cost of enlargement or improvement Capacity of enlargement or improvement (peak-hour traffic)  
(2)  Drainage Improvements. The applicant's proportionate share of storm water and drainage improvements including the installation, relocation or replacement of storm drains, culverts (upsizing to handle additional runoff of storm water), catch basins, manholes, riprap, improved drainage ditches and appurtenances, and relocation or replacement of other storm drainage facilities or appurtenances, shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  The capacity and the design of the drainage system to accommodate storm water runoff shall be based on the standards specified in sections 156.085 through 156.132, computed by the developer's engineer and approved by the City Engineer. 
(b)  The plans for the improved system shall be prepared by the developer's engineer and the estimated cost of the enlarged system calculated by the City Engineer. The pro rata share for the proposed improvement shall be calculated as follows: 
Developer's cost Development-generated peak rate of runoff expressed in cubic feet per second to be accommodated by enlargement or improvement _____= _____Total cost of enlargement or improvement Capacity of enlargement (total capacity expressed in cubic feet per second)  
(3)  Oversizing. Any cost allocation for oversizing of off-site or on-site water and sewer facilities, will be in accordance with the St. Lucie County Extension Policy, as amended, or as required by any private utility provider. 
(4)  Other Improvements. The applicant's proportionate share of other capital improvements shall be computed as follows: 
Developer's cost Development share of capacity of enlargement or improvement _____= _____Total cost of enlargement or improvement Capacity of enlargement or improvement  
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.073. - Escrow Accounts. 
    Where the proposed off-site improvements are to be undertaken at some future date, the monies required for the improvements shall be deposited in a separate interest-bearing account to the credit of the City until such time as the improvements are constructed. If the off-site improvements are not begun within seven (7) years of deposit, all monies and interest shall be returned to the applicant.

Article VI. - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT; MODEL STANDARDS, PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES 

Sec. 156.085. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these provisions is to establish appropriate standards, principles and guidelines for subdivision design. These provisions shall be applicable to the design and improvement of all lands included within a subdivision whether public or private. Good subdivision design can produce a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs. 
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.086. - Conformance with City Policy.

(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94; Ord. No. 04-61, § 5, 5-10-04) 
Sec. 156.087. - Site Analysis and Design. 
(A)  Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing local, regional and state plans for the surrounding community. 
(B)  Site analysis requires an understanding of on-site and off-site conditions. On-site refers to the site itself, such as, the piece of land the client owns. Off-site is less definite, but equally important since no piece of land really ends at the property line. Off-site may refer to land forms, such as valley, ridge, stream, canal or flat terrain which affect a site and which might be affected by actions taken on a site. Site qualities can be categorized into design considerations which become the primary site analysis directions: 
(1)  Site Potentials. How can the land best be used? What obvious or untapped resources exist? 
(2)  Site Problems. What must we be careful of, renew or improve? 
(3)  Site Amenity. What features are unique, pleasurable or scarce and should be reserved for all to use? 
(4)  Site Danger Signals. What areas should be avoided because of excessive development costs and potential problems, such as flat terrain, steep slopes, poor soil percolation, creek and the like. 
(C)  Development of the site shall be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity and to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features. 
(D)  The following specific areas shall be preserved as undeveloped open space, to the extent consistent with the reasonable utilization of land, and in accordance with applicable state or local regulations: 
(1)  Unique and/or fragile areas, including wetlands; 
(2)  Significant trees or stands of trees, defined as the largest known individual trees of each species in the state, large trees approaching the diameter of the known largest tree, or species or clumps of trees that are rare to the area; 
(3)  Lands in the flood plain, as defined by state or local regulations unless provisions are made for protective flood control measures and water-management facilities necessary for flood-free development and flood-free vehicular access to such sites; 
(4)  Steep slopes in excess of twenty (20) percent as measured over a ten-foot interval unless appropriate engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion and resident safety are taken; 
(5)  Habitats of endangered wildlife, as identified on federal or state lists; and 
(6)  Historically significant structures and sites, as listed on federal or state lists of historic places. 
(E)  The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting ground water and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to avoid unnecessary impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and, to mitigate adverse effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties. No filling or grade level change will be permitted which will adversely affect any surrounding area. 
(F)  Special consideration shall be given in the layout of streets, lots, blocks, buildings and easements to the preservation of large and specimen trees. Special consideration shall also be given to preserving natural drainage methods and natural topography and landscape. 
(G)  The St. Lucie County Soil Survey is to be used as a guideline in identifying soil properties and interpretations for various uses in terms of soil limitations and soil features adversely affecting a particular use. The following standards shall be followed in areas of low and very low potential soils: 
(1)  Soils with very low potential for purposed uses, as identified in the St. Lucie County Soil Survey: 
(a)  Health and safety hazards are not created; 
(b)  City maintenance of public facilities is not involved where the soil performance is low or unreliable. 
(2)  Public facilities shall not be constructed where the soil performance for said public facility is of low or very low potential, except in cases of overriding public interest. 
(3)  Dedication shall not be accepted for public ownership or maintenance of utilities or roads constructed in areas where soil performance for said facilities is of a low or very low potential. 
(H)  (1)  The following classifications which describe urban use limiting factors for soils should be investigated at an early stage: 
(a)  Septic tank suitability; 
(b)  Shrink/swell potential; 
(c)  Slippage potential; 
(d)  Flooding danger; 
(e)  Corrosion potential; 
(f)  Permeability (muck, hardpan and the like); 
(g)  Subsurface drainage; and 
(h)  Erosion potential. 
(2)  Any extreme soil condition shall be verified through cross reference with another natural process (vegetation, for instance) and actual field inspection. 
(I)  It is important to determine areas which absorb water well and areas which will not. Generally, gravelly or sandy soils drain well, while clay, mucky or silty loams will not. 
(1)  High density development is appropriate over impermeable soils, since both result in a high amount of surface runoff and generally have a well-developed stream system capable of supporting intensive runoff. 
(2)  Surface runoff should be encouraged over permeable soils which have adequate underground storage capacity. Berms and swales may be used to guide and collect runoff from impermeable areas. 
(J)  Septic tank suitability, shrink/swell, corrosive action and erosion are all mechanical problems related to soil which should be understood as problems and technologic systems designed to solve them. If septic tanks can never work, the developer shall not try to subvert the system by running a perc test during the driest months of the year (November, December or January). Instead, he shall connect to a small community sewer system, scale down or abandon the project.

Sec. 156.088. - Finished Floor Elevation. 
    No platted lot shall be approved that does not contain a suitable building site of sufficient elevation to permit construction utilizing a first-floor elevation based upon the following: 
(A)  Minimum building floor elevation shall be six (6) inches above the three-day rainfall, 100-year return period. Where the floodway of any stream or river is defined, lots shall be platted for residential use only if all parts of the platted lots located within the floodway are expressly limited to open space uses. On-site drainage storage capacity shall not be reduced. 
(B)  The minimum finished floor elevation of any structure shall be as set forth in section 150.401. 
(C)  Driveways or other areas of access to a building or structure shall be sloped so as to prevent the runoff of surface water into any building or structure.

Sec. 156.091. - Commercial and Industrial Development Design. 
    Commercial and industrial development shall be designed according to the same principles governing the design of residential developments; namely, buildings shall be located according to topography, with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable; factors such as drainage, noise, odor and surrounding land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall be provided; and adverse impacts buffered. 
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.092. - Circulation System Design. 
(A)  The street system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and, to present an attractive streetscape. 
(B)  In residential subdivisions, the street system shall be designed to serve the needs of the neighborhood, and: 
(1)  To minimize auto intrusion into the neighborhood; 
(2)  To separate streets carrying higher volumes at higher speeds from residential units; and 
(3)  To maximize convenience and auto access to each dwelling unit. 
(C)  The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety. In conventional developments, walks shall be placed parallel to the street, with exceptions permitted to preserve natural features or to provide visual interest. In planned developments, walks may be placed away from the road system, but they may also be required parallel to the street for safety reasons. 
(Ord. 94-7, passed 3-14-94) 
Sec. 156.093. - Streets. 
(A)  The arrangement of streets shall conform to the official circulation plans and maps of the City.

Sec. 156.126. - Stormwater Management; General Requirements. 
(A)  Protection of the water resources in the City is critical to the public health, safety and welfare. Innovative approaches to storm water management shall be encouraged and the concurrent control of erosion, sedimentation and flooding shall be mandatory. 
(B)  The following general criteria shall be applicable to all proposed storm water management plans, for both public and private improvements, as approved by the City Engineer: 
(1)  When possible, the nonstructural approach shall be used to meet both surface water quantity and quality requirements. 
(2)  The drainage system for each phase of a development shall be capable of standing on its own if subsequent areas planned for development are not developed. 
(3)  The drainage system for each development shall be sized to accommodate existing upstream runoff. 
(4)  The general criteria, as herein and subsequently outlined, shall, in no way, be construed as prohibiting new and innovative techniques. However, all such new and innovative techniques shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer at a pre-application conference stage prior to their use in the design of any development. 
(5)  The storage and controlled release or retention on site and infiltration into the ground of excess storm water runoff from any commercial, industrial and residential developments will be required so that runoff therefrom will not be substantially greater than it was prior to such development. 
(6)  The procedure for disposing of excess storm water runoff shall be dependent on the Hydrologic Soil Classifications of the soils within the proposed development boundaries, which Hydrologic Soil Classification shall be as are used and defined by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (A, B, C or D and A/D, B/D and C/D) in the publication, St. Lucie County, Florida - Soils, and in other publications of the Soil Conservation Services. However, the location and designation of the various Soil Types as depicted therein shall be fully substantiated by Soils analysis, if required by the City Engineer. 
(7)  All major storm water conveyance systems shall be of the shallow, flat, slow-velocity, open channel, "floodway" type which shall be designed to delay or retard runoff from any development. The side slopes of such conveyance systems shall be kept as flat as possible (maximum of three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical). The construction of deep artificial canals, ditches, channels and the like, or the construction of major storm sewer systems, which will rapidly convey runoff to any receiving waters or substantially reduce the level of the ground water table, is extremely prohibited. Substantial reduction of the ground water table shall be minimized and determined on a site-specific basis. 
(8)  All retention areas, excluding wetlands, shall be landscaped with one (1) tree every fifty (50) linear feet. Trees shall be planted at the slope of the retention area to create a vegetative buffer. Tree location, size and species selection shall be approved by the Site Plan Review Committee. 
(9)  Should the proposed development area contain an existing natural watercourse drainageway, channel and the like, such natural watercourse and the vegetation inherent therewith shall be maintained and the proposed development designed so as to preserve same. However, the use of such natural watercourse to carry off runoff from any development shall be permitted if provision for control of sediment in the excess runoff is made prior to entrance of the runoff to the natural watercourse. This does not preclude the use of wetlands for storage and treatment of stormwater runoff as long as the designed drainage system does not measurably degrade the affected area. 
(10)  Computations for street drainage and culverts shall be based upon one-day rainfall, ten-year return period. 
(11)  Street inlets shall be spaced in such a manner as to accept one hundred (100) percent of the design runoff and shall be separated by no more than four hundred (400) feet. Typically, the maximum allowable gutter run will be one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet on streets with standard curbs, and six hundred (600) feet on streets where Miami-type curbs are approved for special application by the City Engineer. However, the actual required spacing will depend on the characteristics of such particular site and the flow quantities to be handled. 
(12)  Runoff from driveways, roofs or other impervious areas shall be diverted so as to flow over grassed areas prior to flowing into any drainage system whenever possible. 
(13)  All detention and retention basins shall be readily accessible from streets of public right-of-way and shall be situated so that maintenance can be easily performed. 
(14)  The side slopes of all detention basins shall be kept as flat as possible (maximum of four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical), providing soil conditions are suitable to sustain plant growth and control erosion. 
(15)  No site alteration shall adversely affect the existing surface water flow pattern. 
(16)  No site alteration shall cause siltation of wetlands, pollution of downstream wetlands or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands. 
(17)  No site alteration shall allow water to become a health hazard. 
(18)  All site alteration activities shall provide for such water retention and settling structures and flow-attenuation devices as may be necessary to insure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met. 
(19)  Where necessary, easements for drainage facilities, as approved by the City Engineer, shall be provided as follows: 
(a)  Any off-site easements, which are needed to make the drainage system function, shall be included in the proposal for development and made a criteria for preliminary and final plat approval. 
(b)  Easements for all facilities must be shown on construction drawings and approved by the City Engineer. The easements and rights-of-way must be executed, accepted by the City Council, and recorded in the public records prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  Alternative storm water management and conservation control strategies shall meet the following performance standards and requirements: 
1.  The outflow hydrograph, as computed for the developed or undeveloped area, shall approximate (within ten (10%) percent in terms of peak flow) the hydrograph of conditions existing before development or redevelopment for the ten-year Frequency Three-Hour Design Rainfalls prior to its entrance into any watercourse outside the developed or redeveloped area. In addition, the existing shape, timing and effect of the outflow hydrographs on downstream flow shall be maintained as much as possible. Runoff rates and volumes resulting from the development, in excess of existing amounts, shall be accommodated in an approved manner on-site. 
2.  The capacity of any outlet watercourse beyond the area of the developed or redeveloped area shall be adequate to convey the peak discharge from a 25-Year Frequency Six-Hour Design Rainfall. If the downstream facilities are inadequate to convey the peak discharge for the design rainfalls above, the proposed development must accommodate that portion of runoff above the downstream systems actual capacity. 
3.  Permitted rates and volumes of storm water runoff, whether discharged into natural or artificial watercourses, shall meet existing water quality standards at the first downstream receiving water body for which such standards have been established. 
4.  Disposition of Storm Water in Impervious Areas. The areas where the soils have been classified under the SCS Hydrologic Soils Classification System as types C and D (impervious) or A/D, B/D and C/D (high ground water table areas), the overall storm water management system shall be that of providing detention basins to attenuate peak from the contributory drainage area and to settle solids washed off or eroded therefrom. Specific guidelines area as follows: 
a.  Size. Detention basins shall have sufficient storage so as to contain the increased runoff after development based upon the 25-year return period, three-day rainfall minus the allowable discharge with a minimum freeboard of two (2) feet in the basis. Minor flooding of the area and streets in the vicinity of the detention basin during the 100-Year Frequency-24-Hour Design Rainfall will be permitted. The capacity of the outlet structure shall be considered in all cases. 
b.  Outlet Structure. Outlet structures shall be as simple as possible (pipe culverts, concrete weirs and the like). Required detention storage in the basin, as defined above, shall be above the invert of the outlet structure. When combined with the detention storage required for the 25-Year Frequency - Six-Hour Design Rainfall the outlet structure shall be of sufficient size to permit seventy-five (75%) percent of the total volume of water temporarily stored in the basin to drain out within twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the theoretical storm. Consideration must be given not to adversely restrict predevelopment flow off-site. 
c.  Configuration. The shape of all detention basins shall be such that no "short-circuiting" of flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved in the basin. Dredging of the settled sediments will be carried out when necessary so that the capacity of the basin is not reduced below that for which it is designed. 
5.  Disposition of Storm Water in Pervious Areas. In areas where soils have been classified under the SCS Hydrologic Soil Classification System as Types A or B (pervious), the overall storm water management strategy shall be that of on-site retention and infiltration into the ground. Specific guidelines are as follows: 
a.  On-Lot Infiltration. The parcel shall be developed to maximize the amount of natural rainfall which is infiltrated into the soil and to minimize direct overland runoff into adjoining streets and watercourses. Storm water runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces could be diverted into swales or terraces on the lot when possible. 
b.  Retention Basins. Retention basins shall have sufficient storage so as to contain the increased runoff after development, based upon the 25-year return period, three-day rainfall minus the allowable discharge, with a minimum freeboard of two (2) feet considering that infiltration out of the basin through the side and bottom is occurring during these storms. Minor flooding of the area and streets in the vicinity of the retention basin during the theoretical 100-Year Frequency - 24 Hour Design Rainfall will be permitted. 
c.  Outlet structure. No actual outlet from a retention basin will be required where such basins are located in soils classified as Type A. However, possible overflow from the basin shall be anticipated and a path for such overflow provided and structures in the development so situated that no flood damage thereto will occur. Retention basins is classified as Type B shall have nominal positive outlet to other basins and/or watercourses. However, the nominal positive outlet shall be assumed to have no capacity when determining retention basin size.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 157.01. - Purpose and Intent. 
(A)  The purpose of this Chapter is to implement the policies of the Future Land Use and Conservation Elements in the City of Port St. Lucie Comprehensive Plan by establishing regulations regarding the protection of natural resources and native vegetation and the protection of historic and prehistoric resources in order to maintain the quality of life in Port St. Lucie and to protect the health, safety, welfare, and general well being of the citizens of Port St. Lucie. 
(B)  The implementation of this chapter is intended to accomplish the following objectives: 
1.  Preserve and protect native upland habitat within Port St. Lucie to maintain a diversity of plant and animal life supported by the plant communities native to this area, and in particular species that are listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Preservation of Native Flora of Florida Act, and the Florida Natural Areas Inventory because of their status as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. 
2.  Protect and sustain natural wetland systems, to minimize activities that degrade, destroy or otherwise negatively impact wetland values and functions, and where appropriate, to reestablish and restore productive wetland systems. 
3.  Protect and preserve estuarine beaches by prohibiting alteration and requiring restoration of degraded beaches during development and redevelopment of property. 
4.  Prevent the degradation or loss of native shoreline habitat and encourage improvement of habitat degraded by shoreline protection structures or other means by prioritizing methods of allowable shoreline stabilization. 
5.  Promote soil conservation by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the city and thereby reduce sedimentation and air and surface water pollution resulting from soil erosion. 
6.  Protect surface water flow by controlling filling activities and changes in drainage patterns. 
7.  Ensure that the activities associated with excavating and the resulting excavation itself do not degrade the natural resources of the city and adversely impact the quantity or quality of surface water or groundwater. 
8.  Encourage water conservation through the preservation of existing plant communities, reestablishment of native plant communities, site development that retains stormwater runoff on site, and recognition of environmentally sensitive site development concepts. 
9.  Preserve and protect properties of historical, cultural, archaeological, aesthetic and architectural merit which represent distinctive elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political, scientific, religious, and architectural history. 
(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15)

(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Secs. 157.11-157.20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - SOIL AND WATER 

Sec. 157.21. - Soil, Erosion, and Sediment Control. 
(A)  Land disturbing activities can cause excessive runoff and accelerate the process of soil erosion, degrade wetland systems, including estuarine wetland systems in the North Fork of the St. Lucie River and the Indian River Lagoon, degrade water quality and shoreline resources, clog storm sewers and swales, and silt navigational channels. In addition, emissions of particulate matter during construction and demolition, including but not limited to incidents caused by vehicular movement, transportation of materials, construction, alteration, demolition, or wrecking of buildings or structures, or the stockpiling of particulate substances, can constitute a nuisance for adjacent property owners and degrade air quality. No person may engage in land-disturbing activity until a plan for the control of erosion and sedimentation has been submitted and approved by the city. 
(B)  The erosion and sediment control plan shall be in accordance with the Engineering Standards for Land Development. 
(C)  Exemptions. Minor land-disturbing activities, such as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, and other related activities, provided such activities do not contribute to any on-site generated erosion, or degradation of lands or water beyond the boundaries of the property of the residence involved. 
(D)  Violations of this article shall constitute grounds for the issuance of a stop-work order by the City Engineer or his/her designee. 
(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 157.22. - Stormwater Management. 
(A)  Stormwater runoff peak discharge rate, volumes, and pollutant loadings shall be managed to minimize the adverse impacts of erosion, sedimentation, flooding, and water pollution to protect surface water, groundwater, and other natural resources. 
(B)  The design, construction, and performance of all surface water management systems shall be in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations, requirements of the South Florida Water Management District, and the requirements of this Code. In all cases, the strictest of the applicable standards shall apply. 
(C)  Exemptions. The following development activities are exempt from the requirements of this subchapter. 
1.  Maintenance activity that does not change or affect the quality, rate, volume, or location of stormwater flows on the site or of stormwater runoff. 
2.  Action taken under emergency conditions to prevent imminent harm or danger to persons, or to protect property from imminent hazards, with approval from the City Engineer. 
(D)  Standards for the stormwater management plan, design, and calculations shall be in accordance with the Engineering Standards for Land Development. Stormwater systems shall be designed to meet the city's adopted level of service for drainage as follows: 
1.  The level of service adopted for stormwater management facilities for existing surface water management systems shall be as shown in the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) permit governing said system. 
2.  Systems without a permit shall be as shown in SFWMD rules in effect at the time of the system's original construction. 
(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 157.23. - Floodplain Protection. 
    All development located in a floodplain shall meet the provisions of Chapter 152. 
(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 157.24. - Shoreline Protection. 
(A)  Priorities for Shoreline Land Use. When reviewing applications for rezoning or amendments to the City's Comprehensive Plan, shoreline land use shall have the following priorities: 
1.  Water-dependent uses such as production or protection of fish, shellfish and wildlife; protection or conservation of coastal and natural resources; recreation, public access, and navigation, provided they have no significant adverse impact upon the land, water or adjacent land uses. 
2.  Water-related or water-enhanced uses such as recreation. 
3.  Scenic waterfront communities. 
4.  Uses which are not water-dependent or water-related which do not result in a diminution of coastal resources, and which are compatible with existing or committed uses in the city. 
(B)  Estuarine beaches. Natural sandy beaches occur in the city on some high energy estuarine shorelines. Sandy, unhardened beaches play an important role in natural shoreline dynamics and protect upland properties and adjacent submerged wetlands by providing a gradually sloping surface for dispersal of wave and water energy. The integrity of this beach system is dependent upon its ability to fluctuate in response to the natural forces of the ocean, such as tides, waves, winds, and storm floods. Pestilent exotic species can invade beaches, displacing native vegetation and endangering the natural qualities of the shore. No alteration of estuarine beaches shall be allowed unless permitted under Section 157.24 (C) and Section 157.25. The following standards shall apply: 
1.  Buffer area. A ten-foot wide buffer area shall be established landward to the mean high tide line of all estuarine beaches. No retention or discharge of stormwater shall be permitted within this buffer area. All pestilent exotic vegetation, as per Chapter 154 Landscaping, shall be removed from the beach and buffer area. 
2.  Restoration. Restoration of estuarine beaches degraded by pestilent exotic species and failed shoreline protection structures shall be required as part of development and redevelopment. Restoration shall include removal of pestilent exotic vegetation, pursuant to Chapter 154, Landscaping; and, removal of shore protection structure, if technically feasible, pursuant to the requirements of this Code. 
(C)  Shoreline Protection Structures. Native shoreline vegetation helps to protect the shoreline against erosion; provides habitat for a diverse community of plants and animals; plays a fundamental role in estuarine ecology and water quality; and is aesthetically pleasing and can be reasonably incorporated as a landing asset for waterfront residence. Rip rap, geotextiles, and geogrids can provide a substrate for marine organisms and native wetland shoreline vegetation, and can aid in the dispersal of coastal energies on shorelines, thereby increasing resistance to erosion and damage by storm driven waves. Seawalls and bulkheads fronted by berms of vegetated rip rap provide better protection for estuarine habitat and shoreline areas than seawalls or bulkheads alone. 
(D)  No shoreline protection structures shall be constructed in the city without first receiving a permit pursuant to the provisions of this Code. Other permits, as may be required by federal, state, and regional authorities, must be submitted to the city prior to issuance of the permit. 
(E)  Standards for shoreline stabilization. The following prioritization of shoreline stabilization techniques shall apply: 
1.  Developments located along shorelines which are not already hardened, or which have failed or damaged seawalls, shall use native wetland shoreline vegetation for shoreline stabilization. 
2.  When stabilization of shorelines with native wetland shoreline vegetation is not technically feasible, then shoreline shall be stabilized with a combination of geotextiles or geogrids and native wetland shoreline vegetation. 
3.  When stabilization of shorelines with geotextiles and geogrids and native wetland shoreline vegetation is not technically feasible, then shorelines shall be stabilized with a combination of rock rip rap and native wetland shoreline vegetation. 
4.  When replacement of failed seawalls with native wetland shoreline vegetation or vegetated rock rip rap is not technically feasible, then seawalls or bulkheads shall be permitted. 
(F)  Prohibitions. Protection structures will not be permitted if any interfere with normal littoral processes or impact coastal natural resources. 
(Ord. No. 15-68, § 1, 9-14-15) 
Sec. 157.25. - Marina Siting Criteria. 
(A)  Improperly situated docking facilities can impede navigation by cluttering waterways. Pilings can contribute to poor water quality conditions by disrupting flow of tidal flushing. Docking facilities can prevent necessary sunlight from reaching seagrasses, which provide essential habitat and nutrition for marine organisms. Collisions with boats and barges is the largest human-related factor causing manatee deaths in Florida. 
(B)  Marina siting criteria shall be applied to all commercial, industrial, and residential multi-slip marinas. Criteria shall be reviewed by the Site Plan Review Committee as part of development approval. 
1.  Preference shall be given to sites which have been legally distributed or identified as suitable in local marina siting plan elements as opposed to sensitive areas. 
2.  Non-water dependent uses (such as bait and tackle, restaurants, utilities and marina support facilities) shall be situated on uplands. 
3.  Marinas shall demonstrate that they have sufficient upland area to accommodate all needed utilities and marina support facilities. 
4.  Docking facilities shall only be approved which require minimal or no dredging and/or filling to provide access by canal, channel, or road. 
5.  Marina basins shall only be approved when the locations have adequate depths to accommodate the proposed boat use. 
6.  Dock and decking design and construction shall ensure penetration of light sufficient to support existing shallow water habitats. 
7.  Landscape buffers and setbacks shall be required to mitigate impacts upon adjacent land uses. 
8.  Marinas shall identify which docking facilities are to be rented and which are to be sold. Areas available to the public shall be identified and maintained as such. 
9.  Sewer pump-out service shall be made available at all marinas capable of servicing or accepting boats inhabited overnight or boats which require pump-out service. 
10.  In the event marina fueling facilities are developed, adequate and effective measures shall be taken to prevent contamination of area waters from spillage or storage tank leakage. 
11.

ARTICLE X. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) ZONING DISTRICT 

Sec. 158.170. - Purpose. 
(A)  It is the intent and purpose of this district to provide, upon specific application and through the processes of unified planning and coordinated development, for the creation of new neighborhood or community areas offering a physical, social, and economic environment of high quality. Specific objectives of the district include the establishment of an orderly pattern of land uses geared to accommodate both near-term and long-term community needs; the efficient and economical use of land; and appropriate and harmonious variety in physical development; creative design; a high level of living and working amenities, including plentiful open space and recreation opportunities; efficient and effective systems of public facilities and services; a high degree of compatibility with adjacent and nearby existing and future development; appropriate conservation and preservation of natural features and resources; and the staging of development so as to best serve the general welfare of the City. 
(B)  Regulations for planned unit developments are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning, subdivision regulation, and other applicable City regulations to the same degree as in instances where City regulations are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot basis rather than on a unified development approach. However, it is essential that the regulations and requirements applying to planned unit developments be sufficiently flexible in structure so as to encourage creative and imaginative design in planning and development. Where there are conflicts between the requirements of the general provisions of this chapter or other applicable codes of the City and the requirements established by official action upon a specific planned unit development, the latter requirements shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.171. - Definition. 
    For the purpose of this subchapter the following definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: 
    Planned Unit Development (PUD). Land planned under unified control and developed in a coordinated manner in one (1) or more development phases for uses and structures well suited to the development itself and the surrounding area of which it is a part, according to an approved conceptual plan of development, and with programs for full maintenance and operation of any facilities and services, not to be dedicated to, and accepted by, a public agency for public ownership, operation and maintenance. PUD's may be for commercial, office, industrial, institutional or residential development or for a mixture of various land uses. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.172. - Standards for District Establishment. 
    In reaching recommendations and decisions as to rezoning land to PUD classification, the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Council shall apply the following standards in addition to the standards and procedures of sections 158.315 through 158.322 applicable to the rezoning of land generally: 
(A)  Area Requirement. In general, the area of a proposed planned unit development district will have to be of substantial size to permit its design and development as a cohesive unit fulfilling the stated purpose and objectives of these regulations and to establish the district as a meaningful segment of the larger community. Each proposed district shall therefor be evaluated as to its adequacy in size with respect to both the nature and character of its internal design and to its specific location within the City. The minimum size of a PUD district to be considered for establishment shall be two (2) acres. 
(B)  Relation to Major Transportation Facilities. PUD districts shall be so located with respect to arterial or major streets, highways, collector streets, or other transportation facilities as to provide suitable access to those districts without creating or generating traffic along minor streets in residential areas or districts outside the PUD districts. 
(C)  Relation to Utilities, Public Facilities, and Services. PUD districts shall be required to obtain developers agreements regarding provision of utilities, to meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan regarding levels of service (LOS) for public facilities and to meet the requirements of Chapter 160, Concurrency Management System. 
(D)  Physical Character of the Site. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosion, or other dangers, annoyances, or inconveniences. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. 
(E)  Consistency with the City Comprehensive Plan. To be eligible for consideration, a PUD rezoning proposal must be found to be consistent with all applicable elements of the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan with respect to both its proposed internal design and its relationship to adjacent areas and the City as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.173. - Permitted Uses. 
    In order to permit maximum flexibility in the design of a proposed planned unit development, no specific permitted uses are established. Uses permitted within a PUD district shall be only those residential, cultural, recreational, business, commercial, industrial, and related uses as are deemed by the City Council to be fully compatible with each other, with the context of the proposed development as a whole, and with the zoning and land use patterns of surrounding areas. The type, general location, and extent of all proposed uses shall be clearly designated as part of the conceptual development plan, and approval of those uses or types of uses as part of a rezoning amendment shall constitute the permitted land use requirements of a particular PUD district to the same extent and degree as were those permitted uses specifically included within these regulations. Any proposed change of approved land usage, other than necessary minor refinements in size, configuration, or location as may be required in the preparation of the detailed development plans, shall require a new hearing and approval action in accordance with the administrative review and approval procedures herein established. Accessory uses normally associated with the uses permitted as part of the approval action upon a specific PUD proposal shall be permitted at those locations and in an intensity as normally provided for that development within other zoning districts of the city, unless accessory uses are expressly prohibited within the approval action or are otherwise regulated by that action. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.174. - Internal PUD Design; Standards. 
(A)  Residential Density. The number and type of residential dwelling units to be permitted within a PUD district or within specific portions of a PUD district shall be as determined by the City Council and stipulated within the approval action. Maximum gross residential density of a PUD district shall be determined by the densities set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  Access. Every dwelling unit or other use permitted within a PUD district shall have access to a public or private street (of the type required for the PUD under subsection 158.172(B)) either directly or via an approved private road, pedestrian way, court, or other area dedicated to public or private use, or common element guaranteeing access. 
(C)  Internal Lots and Frontage. 
(1)  No minimum lot sizes or minimum yards are established for a PUD district under these regulations. However, the applicable minimum lot size and yard size requirements of conventional zoning districts shall be utilized wherever proposed PUD development is essentially equivalent to that development permitted under conventional zoning district classifications. In addition, wherever land within a PUD district has frontage upon preexisting public roads, the front yard requirement of the conventional zoning district most applicable to the use or uses proposed for that land shall apply; and wherever yards within a PUD district abut a conventional zoning district, those yards shall comply with the yard requirements of the conventional zoning district. Where appropriate, the City Council may stipulate minimum lot sizes and minimum yard requirements as part of the approval action. 
(2)  Land area which would normally be required for residential lots, but which is not so used under the permitted lot size reduction provisions of this section of the chapter, shall be devoted instead to common open space for the enjoyment and use by residents of the development and shall be preserved into perpetuity as open space. 
(D)  Minimum Living Area. The minimum living area requirements shall be as stipulated within the approval action. 
(E)  Maximum Building Height. The maximum height of all residential structures not within a PUD, shall be thirty-five (35) feet. Within a PUD, greater than five (5) acres, the maximum height permitted is seventy-five (75) feet. Any structure greater than thirty-five (35) feet in height shall be required to maintain a setback from the property line of such PUD of one hundred (100) percent of the building height, except for PUDs located within the Port St. Lucie Community Redevelopment Area. The maximum height for commercial, office, and institutional uses within a PUD located in the Port St. Lucie Community Redevelopment Area may be one hundred twenty (120) feet or ten (10) stories, whichever is less. All such height requests are contingent upon the approval of a master plan and elevation drawings, which illustrate that the proposed height is compatible with the surrounding land uses. The applicant is required to provide adequate information to support the compatibility of the proposed taller structures with the surrounding land uses. 
(F)  Provision for Vehicular and Pedestrian Circulation. 
(1)  The street and roadway pattern within a PUD shall be designed so as to take advantage of existing natural features and shall provide for a logical and orderly movement of vehicular traffic throughout the development. Provisions shall be made for the reservation or dedication of all rights-of-way needed for the improvement of existing streets or the construction of new streets indicated within the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan. The internal street system shall be properly coordinated with all existing streets and roadways at the project's boundaries, and all streets shall be designed in accordance with City standards and requirements including section 156.098 which limits cul-de-sac lengths to a maximum of one thousand (1,000) feet. 
(2)  Reductions of right-of-way widths below those normally required may be granted in specific cases where the City Council finds lesser widths are appropriate due to the unique design of the PUD. 
(3)  Provision shall be made within a PUD for the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and a system of sidewalks or pedestrian ways shall be incorporated into the PUD design for the exclusive use of pedestrians. 
(G)  Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading Requirements. Off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be provided as set forth within section 158.221. Compact parking space standards may be used for up to thirty (30%) percent of the total required spaces. A compact parking space shall have a minimum of seven and one-half-foot width and length of fifteen (15) feet. 
(H)  Provision for Public Facilities and Services. Provision shall be made within a PUD district for all public facilities and services deemed essential by the City Council for location and establishment within that district. Required sites for facilities and services shall be of such sizes, proportions, and location so as to effectively serve their intended purposes in a manner beneficial to future residents of the development and to the City as a whole. These sites shall be dedicated to the City or other applicable public body at no cost. 
(I)  Underground Utilities. Within a PUD, all utilities, including telephone, television cable, and electrical systems shall be installed underground. Appurtenances to these systems which require above-ground installation shall be effectively screened and, thereby, may be exempted from this requirement. Primary facilities providing services to the site of the PUD may be exempted. 
(J)  Protection of Natural Features. Provision shall be made within the design of a PUD for the protection and conservation of significant natural features within or adjacent to the site. Where any alteration of those features is required as part of the development proposed within the PUD district, the developer shall replace the altered features with natural features or areas acceptable to the City. 
(K)  Landscaping and Buffering. Landscaping and buffering requirements are subject to Chapter 154. An alternative landscape plan may be approved for a PUD provided that it fulfills the purpose and intent of Chapter 154. Wherever essential to ensure compatibility, land use areas within a PUD shall be suitably screened from each other and from adjacent development or roadways outside the PUD by appropriate buffering materials. Buffering shall be provided by use of natural vegetation, landscaping berms, or decorative wood or masonry walls. 
(L)  Commercial and Industrial Development. In general, commercial or industrial uses within a PUD district shall be only those deemed essential to serve the needs of the PUD residents and not the general needs of the surrounding area. However, where it is found by the City that the lands within a proposed PUD district are appropriately located and of proper size and configuration so as to serve an existing or future need or commercial or industrial development of the larger community, provision for the development may be included within that proposed PUD district. No commercial or industrial uses shall be approved as part of a PUD unless the location, site size, and proposed intensity of those uses are found to be consistent with the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan.

ARTICLE X.5. - MASTER PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (MPUD) ZONING DISTRICT 

Sec. 158.185. - Purpose. 
(A)  It is the intent and purpose of this district to provide, upon specific application and through the processes of unified planning and coordinated development, for the creation of large-scale, sustainable new communities with mixed uses. The specific objectives of the district are to incorporate a mixture of land uses, consistent with the densities and intensities authorized by the new community development (NCD) future land use designation; provide a greater variety of uses closer to home and work; reduce reliance on the automobile and build a sense of place and community; provide wildlife corridors and upland habitat preservation; provide a diversity of housing types to enable citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live within its boundaries; provide adequate public facilities; replace piecemeal planning which reacts to development on a project-by-project basis with a long-range vision to create an integrated new community. 
(B)  Regulations for master planned unit developments (MPUD) are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning, planning and design principles and standards that shall govern development within the MPUD. Where there are conflicts between the requirements of the general provisions of this chapter or other applicable codes of the City and the requirements established by the MPUD regulation book, the MPUD regulation book shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 10-62, § 2, 8-9-10) 
Sec. 158.186. - Definition. 
    For the purpose of this article the following definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    MASTER PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (MPUD). Land that is part or all of an NCD future land use district, or any sub-district and is included in or approved as part of a development of regional impact. The area is under unified control and developed in a coordinated manner in one (1) or more development phases according to an approved MPUD Conceptual master plan and regulation book. 
(Ord. No. 10-62, § 2, 8-9-10) 
Sec. 158.187. - Standards for District Establishment. 
    In reaching recommendations and decisions as to rezoning land to MPUD classification, the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Council shall apply the following standards in addition to the standards and procedures of sections 158.315 through 158.322 applicable to the rezoning of land generally: 
(A)  Area Requirement. The minimum size of a MPUD district to be considered for establishment shall be one hundred (100) acres. Boundaries of the area shall be identified and established. 
(B)  Relation to Major Transportation Facilities. MPUD districts shall be so located with respect to arterial or major streets, highways, collector streets, or other transportation facilities as to provide suitable access to those districts. 
(C)  Relation to Utilities, Public Facilities, and Services. MPUD districts shall be required to obtain developers agreements regarding provision of utilities, public facilities and services as applicable. 
(D)  Development of Regional Impact (DRI). The proposed MPUD district shall be located within an approved DRI and be consistent with all applicable conditions of the approved DRI development order.

(3)  If the request for a reasonable accommodation is made by a qualifying entity on behalf of disabled individuals: (i) it is the continuing obligation of the qualifying entity to submit Verification of Disability Status forms on behalf of each of the disabled individuals. The Verification of Disability Status Form is maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the City Attorney's Office and (ii) the reasonable accommodation request form must be signed by both the owner and the Applicant of the residential dwelling (if different individuals). 
(4)  Should the information provided by the disabled individual(s) or qualifying entity to the City include medical information or records, including records indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history of the disabled individual(s), such individual(s) may, at the time of submitting such medical information, request that the City, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical information as confidential information of the disabled individual(s). The City shall thereafter endeavor to provide written notice to the disabled individual(s) and/or their representative, of any request received by the City for disclosure of the medical information or documentation, which the disabled individual(s) has previously requested be treated as confidential by the City. The City will cooperate with the disabled individual(s), to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by such individual(s) to oppose the disclosure of such medical information or documentation, but the City shall have no obligation to initiate, prosecute or pursue any such action, or to incur any legal or other expenses (whether by retention of outside counsel or allocation of internal resources) in connection therewith, and may comply with any judicial order without prior notice to the disabled individual(s) or qualifying entity. 
(c)  Spatial Considerations: If the clustering of Recovery Residences would occur by the granting of an Applicant's reasonable accommodation request, it shall be the obligation of the Applicant to establish that such clustering would not create a fundamental alteration of a residential neighborhood and will best meet the needs of the Applicant. 
(d)  Reasonable Accommodation Decision Making Process: 
(1)  The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation. When a reasonable accommodation request form has been completed and submitted to the City Attorney, it will be referred to the City Manager, or designee, for review and consideration. The City Manager, or designee, shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a completed application and may, in accordance with federal law: 
(i)  Grant the accommodation request; 
(ii)  Grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request; or 
(iii)  Deny the request, in accordance with federal law. 
Any such denial shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal. The notice of determination shall be sent to the Applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested. If reasonably necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the City Manager, or designee, may, prior to the end of said thirty (30) day period, request additional information from the Applicant, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. The Applicant shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the request for additional information to provide the requested information. In the event a request for additional information is made, the thirty (30) day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the City Manager, or designee, shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the additional information. If the Applicant fails to provide the requested additional information with said fifteen (15) day period, the City Manager, or designee, shall issue a written notice advising that the Applicant had failed to timely submit the additional information and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the City with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
(2)  Within thirty (30) days after the City Manager's, or designee's, determination on a reasonable accommodation request is mailed to the Applicant, such Applicant may appeal the decision. All appeals shall contain a statement containing sufficient detail of the grounds for the appeal. Appeals shall be to the Special Magistrate who shall, after public notice and a quasi-judicial public hearing, render a determination as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after an appeal has been filed. An appeal of a decision by the Special Magistrate shall be handled exclusively in the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit in and for St. Lucie County, Florida. Such appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for writ of certiorari within thirty (30) days from the date of filing of the written order by the City Clerk. 
(e)  Reapplication after Denial of a Reasonable Accommodation Request: No reasonable accommodation request shall be considered by the City if the Applicant's same or substantially similar reasonable accommodation request was denied, and not overturned by subsequent order, within the previous twelve (12) months absent a material and substantial change in circumstances from the date of the denial. It shall be in the City Attorney's sole discretion to determine whether a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred. 
(f)  Revocation of an Approved Reasonable Accommodation Request: 
(1)  Grounds for Revocation. The City Manager, or designee, may initiate an action to revoke an approval for a reasonable accommodation request, when he or she finds by competent and substantial evidence that: 
(i)  The Applicant provided false or misleading information on the reasonable accommodation request; 
(ii)  The property subject to the reasonable accommodation request has been found to be in violation the conditions of approval of the reasonable accommodation request; 
(iii)  Any applicable state or federal certification has expired or been revoked; or 
(iv)  Since the granting of the reasonable accommodation request, the reasonable accommodation has become injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
(2)  Revocation Procedures. 
(i)  Notice of Intent to Revoke. If the City Manager, or designee, finds cause exists to revoke a reasonable accommodation, he or she shall cause to be served upon the Applicant a written notice of intent to revoke which shall contain the grounds upon which such revocation is proposed. The applicant shall have ten (10) days in which to respond. 
(ii)  Notice of Hearing. If the Applicant fails to show compliance with the order approving the reasonable accommodation request, City Manager, or designee, shall schedule a publicly noticed quasi-judicial hearing to occur no later than thirty (30) days from the date the Notice of Intent to Revoke was served upon the Applicant before the Special Magistrate and shall cause to be served upon the Applicant a Notice of Hearing. 
(iii)  The Special Magistrate shall, after public notice and a quasi-judicial public hearing, render a determination as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Notice of Hearing has been filed. An appeal of a decision by the Special Magistrate shall be handled exclusively in the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit in and for St. Lucie County, Florida. Such appeal shall be taken by filing a petition for writ of certiorari within thirty (30) days from the date of filing of the written order by the City Clerk. 
(g)  Annual Renewal: An approval of a reasonable accommodation request shall be valid for twelve (12) months. An Applicant may renew the reasonable accommodation request approval by completion of a renewal reasonable accommodation request form, which form is maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the City Attorney's Office. The renewal reasonable accommodation request form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for processing the reasonable accommodation renewal request. Said form must be received by the City Attorney no later than the last day of the eleventh month from when the last approval was granted. All forms submitted after that date shall result in a denial. 
(h)  Fees: There shall be no fee imposed by the City in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation under this section or an appeal of a determination of such request to the Special Magistrate, and the City shall have no obligation to pay an Applicant's (or an appealing party's, as applicable) attorneys' fees or costs in connection with the request, or an appeal. 
(i)  Pending Application or Appeal and Enforcement of Zoning Code: While an application for reasonable accommodation, or appeal of a determination of same, is pending before the City, the City will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the Applicant. 
(j)  General Provisions: 
(1)  The City shall display a notice on the City's webpage (and shall maintain copies available for review in P&Z, the Building/Permitting Division, and the City Clerk's Office), advising the public disabled individuals (and qualifying entities) may request reasonable accommodation as provided herein. 
(2)  A disabled individual may apply for a reasonable accommodation on his/her own behalf or may be represented at all stages of the reasonable accommodation process by a person designated by the disabled individual. 
(3)  The City shall provide such assistance and accommodation as is required pursuant to FHA and ADA in connection with a disabled person's request for reasonable accommodation, including without limitation, assistance with reading application questions, responding to questions, completing the form, filing an appeal, and appearing at a hearing, etc., to ensure the process is accessible.

(A)  Accept or modify the proposed boundary and authorize such administrative site plan approvals for a specified period of time. The City Council may also establish such procedures only for a designated project size if determined this is in the best interest of the City. 
(B)  Reject the proposal and direct staff to study the area with the intent of forming a redevelopment plan and associated Comprehensive Plan land use changes to limit infrastructure and development within such designated high hazard area. In this case, the City Council should establish a development moratorium for a designated period of time within a particular area while development plans are designed. 
(C)  Authorize a combination of (A) and (B) as noted above. 
(D)  Reject the proposed boundary and require existing procedures to be followed.

ARTICLE XIII. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS 

Sec. 158.255. - Intent. 
    Certain land uses, due to their unique functional characteristics and the potentiality for their incompatibility with adjoining land uses, require special consideration on an individual basis of their suitability for location and development within particular zoning districts. These uses have been designated as special exception uses within appropriate zoning district classifications set forth in sections 158.060 through 158.183. It is the intent of this chapter that these uses may be permitted within the zoning district classifications only after affirmative findings that they can be developed at particular locations in a compatible manner. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.256. - Application for Special Exception. 
(A)  Application Limitations. 
(1)  No application for special exception shall be accepted for filing if all or any portion of the land which is the subject of the application was part of a previous application meeting any of the following conditions: 
a.  An application denied by the City Council for the same special exception within the previous 12-month period; 
b.  An application allowed to be withdrawn by the City Council within the previous 12-month period and relating to the same special exception. 
(2)  The time limits set forth above may be waived by the Planning and Zoning Board when the action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the City. 
(B)  Application Requirements. Application for a special exception use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall include all necessary information and drawings as may be required to clearly describe the nature and extent of the special exception sought. The applicant shall be required to pay a fee as may be established to defray processing costs relating to the review and hearing of the application. An application shall be accepted only for a special exception use which is permissible within the zoning district classification applying to the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.257. - Public Hearings Required. 
    The Planning and Zoning Board shall review the application to determine the suitability for development of the proposed use at the subject location and shall hold a public hearing upon the merits of the application. Following the hearing, the Planning and Zoning Board shall submit its recommendation upon the application to the City Council, and the recommendation shall be entered into official record of the application and shall be considered by the City Council prior to the taking of official action upon the application. Prior to its action upon the application, the City Council shall hold a public hearing thereon. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.258. - Notice of Hearing. 
(A)  The notice of hearings shall be published at least seven (7) days prior to the dates set for hearings by the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Council. The notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The notice shall include the date, time, place, and location of hearing, and shall include a description of the proposed special exception and the subject property involved. 
(B)  In addition to required notices as heretofore set forth, other methods of notification may be utilized by the City at its option. These methods may include, but not be limited to, mail notification to owners of property within a maximum of 750 feet to property forming the subject of the public hearing, whose address is known by reference to the latest ad valorem tax record. The notice shall set a time and place for the public hearing. The notice shall be given at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the public hearing and a copy of the notice shall be kept available for public inspection during regular business hours. Notice may be posted upon the property which is the subject of the public hearing.

Sec. 158.259. - Conduct of Hearings. 
    Any interested persons shall have the right to submit oral or written testimony at the hearings.

(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.260. - Requirements and Approval. 
    Special exceptions are uses that would only be allowed under certain conditions and are reviewed to be compatible with the existing neighborhood. It is expected that any such approval be implemented in a timely manner to ensure the use is established under the physical conditions of the area in place when approved. Therefore, Special Exception Uses shall expire after one (1) year on the date of approval unless the applicant has received final site plan approval, or if a site plan is not required, the appropriate permits to allow development of the use to continue as approved. 
    Approval of a special exception application shall be granted by the City Council only upon a finding that: 
(A)  Adequate ingress and egress may be obtained to and from the property, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or other emergency. 
(B)  Adequate off-street parking, loading areas, and adequate stacking may be provided, without creating undue noise, glare, odor, or other detrimental effects upon adjoining properties. 
(C)  Adequate and properly located utilities are available or may be reasonably provided to serve the proposed development. 
(D)  Adequate screening or buffering. Additional buffering beyond that which is required by the code may be required in order to protect and provide compatibility with adjoining properties. 
(E)  Signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting will be so designed and arranged so as to promote traffic safety and to eliminate or minimize any undue glare, incompatibility, or disharmony with adjoining properties. Light shields or other screening devices may be required. 
(F)  Yards and open spaces will be adequate to properly serve the proposed development and to ensure compatibility with adjoining properties. 
(G)  The use as proposed will be in conformance with all stated provisions and requirements of this chapter. 
(H)  Establishment and operation of the proposed use upon the particular property involved will not impair the health, safety, welfare, or convenience of residents and workers in the City. 
(I)  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use the facility, or because of the hours of operation, or because of vehicular movement, noise, fume generation, or type of physical activity. The City may require certain uses such as car washes, gas stations, and other potential noise generating uses submit a noise impact analysis prepared by a qualified professional. 
(J)  The use as proposed for development will be compatible with the existing or permitted uses of adjacent property. The proximity or separation and potential impact of the proposed use (including size and height of buildings, access location, light and noise) on nearby property will be considered in the submittal and analysis of the request. The City may request project design changes, changes to the proposed use to mitigate the impacts upon adjacent properties and the neighborhood. To minimize exposure to excessive noise, the City may require noise control features, limit hours of operation, and other mitigation methods. 
(K)  As an alternative to reducing the scale and/or magnitude of the project as stipulated in criteria (J) above, the City may deny the request for the proposed use if the use is considered incompatible, too intensive or intrusive upon the nearby area and would result in excessive disturbance or nuisance from the use altering the character of neighborhood. 
(L)  Development and operation of the proposed use will be in full compliance with any additional conditions and safeguards which the City Council may prescribe, including but not limited to reasonable time limit within which the action for which special approval is requested shall be begun or completed or both.

Sec. 158.261. - Action of City Council. 
    The decision of the City Council may be to approve, approve with additional conditions and safeguards, or deny any application for special exception use. This decision shall be rendered within sixty (60) calendar days following the public hearing by the Planning and Zoning Board and shall be determined by a majority vote of a constituted quorum of the City Council. All decisions of the City Council shall be made in open session and the resolution embodying the decision approving, approving with additional conditions and safeguards, or denying any application shall not be valid unless it is incorporated into the minutes of the meeting at which the action is taken. A record of all actions of the City Council on special exception uses shall be maintained within the office of the Zoning Administrator. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.262. - Compliance With Conditions Before Permits are Issued. 
    No development order for construction shall be issued until and unless any proposed construction is found to be in full compliance with the approval action of the City Council, including any additional conditions and safeguards incorporated therein. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the Zoning Administrator and City Engineer have inspected the site for compliance with the approval action of the City Council and have determined in writing to the City Building Official that all requirements, conditions, and specifications embodied within the approval action have been met.

    Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments hereto which may later be adopted, there may exist: Land parcels; structures; uses; or characteristics of uses which were lawful before this chapter was enacted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted by this chapter as enacted or amended. It is the intent of this chapter to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are voluntarily removed or removed as required by this chapter, but not to promote or encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, intensified, extended, or be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.276. - Nonconforming Use Constituting a Nuisance.

Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and the fastening thereof in a permanent position and the fastening thereof in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, the excavation, demolition, or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently until the completion of the new construction involved. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.278. - Nonconforming Adjoining Lots of Record Within Same Ownership. 
(A)  If two (2) or more lots of record, portions of lots of record, or any combination thereof, within the same ownership and having continuous frontage on the same street are of record as of the effective date of enactment or a relevant amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of those lots, portions of lots, or combinations thereof do not meet the applicable area or width requirements of this chapter, those lots, portions of lots, or combination thereof shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Where those lots, portions of lots, or combination thereof are occupied by one (1) or more structures or uses, the Zoning Administrator shall determine and establish the effective allocation of the total land parcel to the structures or uses in a manner as to provide for the maximum degree of compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter, and allocation shall thereafter constitute the land to be utilized for the existing individual structures or uses in the administration and enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)  Where those lots, portions of lots, or combinations thereof are vacant, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of that parcel shall be used or transferred in ownership so as to diminish the degree of compliance with the applicable area or width requirements of this chapter; nor shall any division of any parcel by made which creates a land parcel having an area or width not meeting the applicable requirements of this chapter. 
(B)  In the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this section, burden of proof relating ownership as of the effective date of enactment or relevant amendment of this chapter shall lie with the owner of the affected property. Where a violation of the provisions of this section is found to exist, irrespective of the elapsed time period following the date of the violation, no development permit of any type shall be issued by the city for the entirety or any portion of the affected property while the violation continues to exist, and the remedies therefor shall lie solely among the affected property owners or their successors in title. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.279. - Enlargement or Extension of Nonconforming Use or Characteristic of Use Prohibited. 
    A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged upon, extended, intensified, expanded, or moved so as to utilize any other portion of the lot or parcel it occupies; nor shall any nonconforming characteristic of use be changed so as to increase the degree of nonconformity with the applicable requirements of this chapter.

    Whenever a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a building or structure ceases for any reason (except where governmental action impedes access to the premises) for a period of six (6) months or more, these nonconforming uses shall not thereafter be reestablished and the subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. However, if prior to the expiration of the six-month period, proper application is made to the City Council for change to another nonconforming use of the same character, or to a more restricted but nonconforming use, a change to another nonconforming use may be permitted, subject to the following provisions: 
(A)  The City Council shall find that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district than the existing or discontinued nonconforming use and that any adverse effects upon neighboring properties and residents will not be greater than those created by the existing or discontinued nonconforming use. 
(B)  In approving any change, the City Council shall be authorized to impose appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99)

(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.285. - Existence of Nonconformity not to Constitute Grounds for Establishment of Additional Nonconformities. 
    The existence of a nonconforming land parcel, building, structure, use, or characteristic of use shall not constitute grounds for the obtainment of a variance to establish additional nonconformities, either within the same zoning district or within a zoning district applying elsewhere in the City. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.286. - Nonconformity Other Than Use.

(2)  Variances of less than thirty-six (36) inches (three (3) feet) to height and front, rear and side yard setbacks for existing structures. Such an administrative variance does not permit reconstruction of a destroyed structure. 
(3)  Variances of less than thirty-six (36) inches (three (3) feet) to front, rear and side yard setbacks for existing accessory structures. Such an administrative variance does not permit reconstruction of a destroyed accessory structure.

The Planning and Zoning Board and Zoning Administrator may authorize the variance from the provisions of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. In order to authorize any variance from the terms of this chapter, the Planning and Zoning Board or Zoning Administrator should consider: 
(1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district. 
(2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from any action of the applicant. 
(3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, buildings, or structures, in the same zoning district. 
(4)  That literal interpretation of the provisions of the chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the chapter and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(5)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure. 
(6)  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the chapter and that the variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(7)  That there will be full compliance with any additional conditions and safeguards which the Planning and Zoning Board or Zoning Administrator may prescribe, including but not limited to reasonable time limits within which the action for which variance is required shall be begun or completed, or both.

(C)  No variance or approval of use shall be granted so as to permit a use not specified as a permitted use or permissible as a special exception use within this chapter for the particular zoning district involved. 
(Ord. No. 98-84, § 1, 3-22-99) 
Sec. 158.297. - Application for Variance.

APPENDIX B. - CITY OF PORT ST. LUCIE LAND USE CONVERSION MANUAL 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This section briefly summarizes background factors underlying the land use conversion concept and identifies the purpose and intent of the land use conversion manual. 
In 1982-83, the City of Port St. Lucie Comprehensive Plan Evaluation and Appraisal Report identified several land use issues requiring changes in the City's land use plan and related policies. Issues identified included: 
 Platted small single-family lots along major roadways have deterred development; 
 Need for more diverse housing structure types within the community; 
 Shortage of land available for both commercial and institutional facilities; and 
 Traffic flow has been inhibited along major thoroughfares by excessive curb-cuts serving single-family homes on 80-foot lots 
In response to these issues, the City prepared and adopted land use conversion policies to promote: 1) Assembly of small single-family lots along major thoroughfares; and 2) Development of multiple-family residential housing as well as additional commercial and institutional activities on these strategically located sites along major transportation corridors. 
This manual is intended to explain the land use conversion process, available conversion options, and implementation policies. The manual addresses requirements for land assembly, rezoning requirements, and related site plan and design considerations. The manual is intended to facilitate administrative requirements for implementing the Comprehensive Plan land use conversion policies. 
The land use conversion process is designed to accomplish the following objectives: 
 Promote assembly of single-family residential lots along strategically located segments of major thoroughfares; 
 Encourage well-designed non-residential development and multiple family housing with controlled access along major thoroughfares: 
 Improve traffic circulation by restricting curb-cuts and providing effective systems for off-street parking and internal circulation; 
 Alleviate potential adverse impacts on single-family development by mandating standards for building setbacks, landscaping, screening, and buffering; and 
 Foster unified design in land use conversion projects by requiring unity of title and application of good principles of site design. 
II. LAND USE CONVERSION AREAS AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS 
This section identifies the various types of land use conversion areas within the City of Port St. Lucie. Figure 3 delineates the general location of the conversion areas presented in the City of Port St. Lucie Comprehensive Plan. Pages 11 through 23 identify the individual conversion areas on small area maps. These maps specify the frontage and depth requirements, minimum lot size, minimum curb-cut separation, maximum height, and rear yard requirements for each individual conversion area. 
In addition, Table I (page 7) summarizes the zoning districts which are compatible for each type of land use conversion. 
III. LAND ASSEMBLY REQUIREMENTS 
Required land assembly is primarily determined by major thoroughfare frontage and depth requirements as noted in the individual conversion area maps, and illustrated in Figure 4 (page 24). I he minimum required land area is 20,000 square feet. Exceptions to frontage and depth requirements are illustrated in Figure 5 (page 26). 
Minimum Area Requirements/Frontage and Depth Requirements 
The minimum area for a land use conversion site is 20,000 square feet, although several land use conversion areas require an area upwards to 60,000 square feet. Frontage and depth requirements and typical exceptions to the rule are graphically presented on Figures 4 and 5, respectively. 
A major variation of the 20,000 square feet minimum area requirement applies to several sites with a depth greater than 125 feet which are located on Port St. Lucie Boulevard between Airoso Boulevard and Morningside Boulevard. On these sites the area extending beyond the 125 feet depth limitation can only be utilized for landscaping, buffering, retention and other such uses. The minimum site size is intended to apply to the total land area which is actually buildable, i.e., the area within the 125 feet buildable depth. The only exception occurs when a drainage right-of-way, tract, or a prior conversion precludes combining additional property. 
Blocks 87-91. 102, 103, 109. 117 and 125-127, which are located within the Prima Vista Boulevard Conversion Area (map on page 23) prohibit parking areas, driveways, or structures at a depth greater than 225 feet. On these blocks the area extending beyond the 225 feet depth limitation can only be utilized for landscaping, buffering, retention and other such uses. 
Avoiding Isolated Lots 
Rezoning petitions for the conversion of residentially zoned lands should avoid the isolation of lots which are of insufficient size to meet the performance standards established for a particular conversion area. In cases where the petition results in the isolation of such lots, the City Council shall have the option of denying the petition or requiring the provision of joint driveways and parking lot easements in order to allow the isolated lots to be integrated with adjacent conversion areas which are consistent with the applicable performance standards. 
Unified Ownership 
At the time a rezoning application for land use conversion is submitted, applicants are required to submit appropriate legal documentation demonstrating conformity with unified ownership of the properties involved. The Legal Department will prepare a unity of title and will record the unity of title after the rezoning is approved by the City Council. 
IV. REZONING PROCESS 
When the land assembly requirements of the land use conversion process are met, the applicant must apply for a zoning map amendment. Sections 158.315 through 158.322 inclusive of the Zoning Code describe the zoning process, including detailed stipulations governing procedures and timing considerations. Major factors included in the rezoning procedures are identified below. 
Rezoning Application and Filing Fee 
An application for amending the zoning map should be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. The application for amendment must: 1) Be signed by the applicant; 2) include the applicant's name and address; and 3) be verified under oath by the applicant pursuant to Section 158.316 of the Zoning Code. 
All applications for amending the Zoning Code must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator accompanied by a filing fee. The filing fee will be as established by the City Council to cover the expenses of handling the amendment application, providing public notice, taking an official record at public hearings, and for other purposes. No fee will be refunded except as expressly authorized by the City Council. 
Review of the Rezoning Application 
Rezoning applications are reviewed by the City Planner, who forwards comments and recommendations to the Planning and Zoning Board. The Planning and Zoning Board establishes a date for a public hearing and carries out notice requirements of Section 158.318 of the Zoning Code. The City Council considers the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Board and convenes at least one public hearing prior to acting on the rezoning petition. Procedures for a City Council public hearing and notice requirements are established in Section 158.319 of the Zoning Code. Any interested person has the right to submit oral or written testimony at the subject public hearings. However, evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious may be excluded from the official record on the application. 
Criteria for Review and Timing of the Rezoning Process 
The application for rezoning within land use conversion areas is evaluated based on its relationship to the Comprehensive Plan, or element or portion thereof. No application for land use conversion may be approved if it is found to be inconsistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
The rezoning process generally requires 60 to 90 days. However, the process can extend over a much longer duration in cases where divisive development issues arise. A flow chart of the rezoning process, including timing considerations, is presented in Figure 2 (page 10). 
V. SITE PLAN AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
Several site plan and design considerations are mandated as prerequisites for a land conversion project. This section identifies such requirements, including off-street parking; curb-cut limitations and joint access agreements; building height restrictions and rear yard setback provisions; landscaping, screening, and buffering; and unified ownership. 
Off-Street Parking 
Zoning for multiple-family residential development will not be approved within land use conversion areas unless compliance with off-street parking requirements and curb-cut restrictions are demonstrated. Such demonstration must include legal assurances for accommodating present and possible future needs for joint use of off-street parking access ways and curb-cuts in order to avoid undue proliferation of curb cuts on major thoroughfares. Section 158.221 of the Zoning Code stipulates detailed off-street parking provisions. Controlled curb-cuts and joint access agreements are discussed below. 
Curb-Cuts 
The minimum distance between curb-cuts providing access to land use conversion areas along major thoroughfares must be 150 feet and the minimum distance from a street intersection must be 180 feet. Curb-cuts must be restricted to locations abutting a major thoroughfare, as opposed to local residential streets, excepting allowable side street access points approved as part of the site plan review process. 
The City Code of Ordinances includes a variance procedure through which an applicant may request a variance to stipulate curb-cut restrictions. However, no such variance can be granted unless variance criteria established in the Zoning Code are met. In addition, the following assumptions must be satisfied: 
1)  All other performance standards are satisfied; 
2)  Plans for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation indicate that projected traffic generation will not adversely impact traffic flow on or off the site; 
3)  No other feasible traffic circulation plan is available to service the site; 
4)  The density and/or intensity of development proposed for the site is determined not to exceed a reasonable threshold considering site limitations, traffic impacts, and the need to maintain safe and convenient access along major thoroughfares; and, 
5)  The applicant has agreed to provide improvements or other equitable contributions which may be necessary to protect against adverse transportation Impacts. 
Joint Access Agreements 
Rezoning petitions for land use conversion which result in isolated lots incapable of meeting the off-street parking requirements and curb-cut restrictions shall be denied by the City Council or required to acquire agreements from adjacent developments for joint driveways and parking lot easements. All joint access parking agreements must be submitted as part of the rezoning application and must be approved by the City Attorney prior to approval of the petition. Preparation of joint access agreements must reflect specifications consistent with Section 158.222: Access Standards, within the City Zoning Code. 
In addition, per the City of Port St. Lucie Citywide Design Standards pedestrian and vehicular connections shall be provided between adjacent parcels and buildings at the time of site plan approval. Cross-access agreements shall be obtained by adjacent property owners. 
Special Height and Yard Requirements 
The maximum height of any structure developed with a "Medium Density Residential" (RM) or "Residential/Office/Institutional" (ROI) land use conversion area shall be two stories, including under building parking. The ROI conversion areas on Port St. Lucie Boulevard from Airoso east to Morningside shall be subject to a maximum height limitation of one story, In cases where a two story building is developed within a designated RM or ROI land use conversion area a required rear yard setback must be 50 feet from any adjacent single-family residential district or use. 
Landscape, Screening, and Buffering 
Proposals for development within land use conversion areas shall demonstrate compliance with landscape and screening requirements of the City Code of Ordinances. In addition, a solid masonry wall six feet in height above the finished floor elevation of the primary building shall buffer the multiple-family residential development from all directly abutting single-family residential district zoning. 
Unity of Title 
A recorded unity of title is required for all land included within site plans for development of multiple-family or non-residential uses within land use conversion areas. The unity of title is prepared and recorded by the City's Legal Department upon the submittal by the applicant of appropriate legal documentation demonstrating conformity with unified ownership of the properties involved. 
VI. VARIANCE PROCEDURES 
On November 27, 1995, the City Council approved Ordinance No. 95-48 for a land use change to the Bayshore Area. The ordinance included a new policy to the Comprehensive Plan, which reads as follows: 
"Policy 1.1.4.12: A manual shall be established to implement conversion areas of the Future Land Use Map. It shall include development of performance standards to allow conversions and include variance procedures for exceptions to such standards only in appropriate locations. The Planning and Zoning Board shall review these variance requests and forward a recommendation to the City Council for final approval or denial authority regarding such requests." 
The new policy recognizes that there are certain properties which cannot comply with the development standards as outlined in this manual. For instance, those properties which have drainage rights-of-way which prohibit the ability to have enough road frontage For those properties, and others which exhibit undue hardship, a variance process can be applied for to waive such requirements and allow for rezoning. Before making a recommendation on the variance request, the Planning and Zoning Board shall hold a public hearing per Section 158.298 of the City's Zoning Code. The recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board is forwarded to the City Council for final action by motion. 
In order to meet the intent of the approved policy, the following performance standards are to be applied. 
1)  Any application which would result in adjacent lots becoming non-conforming to the conversion standards shall be required to submit a conceptual site plan as a part of the variance. It shall be processed together with rezoning as one application 
2)  The plan shall designate adequate buffers surrounding the site and remaining properties. 
3)  Where appropriate, the plan shall be designed as one project and must provide for shared access and parking of any remaining, or adjacent lots or parcels which would not conform to the conversion standards as a result of the variance. It shall not result in isolation or landlocked lots without providing access. 
4)  The plan shall not allow for access onto residential streets or non-conversion area streets. 
5)  The plan shall require the recording of Unity of Title for the project to prohibit further division and sale of separate lots which were a part of the overall approved site plan. Also, recording of access easements for future use of the remaining adjacent lots is required. Verification of this is required prior to the issuance of building permits for the project.

(Ord. 89-134, passed 12-11-89; Am. Ord. 99-20, § 2, 4-26-99; Ord. No. 13-27, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.03. - Findings and Declarations. 
(A)  The City Council hereby finds that new development in the City requires additional governmental services and facilities, specifically including law enforcement services as provided by the Port St. Lucie Police Department. It is the policy of the City Council, as specified in the comprehensive plan, that new development should be permitted to occur only where an adequate level of service can be provided. 
(B)  It is the policy of the Council that new development should pay a fair share of capital costs related to the additional governmental services and facilities required to accommodate that new development. 
(C)  It is the purpose of this article to ensure the provision of an adequate level of service in law enforcement throughout the jurisdiction, so that new development may occur in a manner consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(D)  Under the provisions of this article, new development shall be required to pay a reasonable and fair portion of overall capital costs related to the additional law enforcement services made necessary by such new development, in order to avoid assessing those costs against the City's general fund. New development is not responsible for the public facility needs for existing development and impact fees will not be used to cure existing deficiencies resulting from existing development. 
(E)  The Council hereby finds that impact fees provide a reasonable method of regulating new development in the City to ensure that such new development pays an appropriate share of capital costs of governmental services and facilities necessary to accommodate new development. 
(F)  The City of Port St. Lucie Police Department provides law enforcement services on a City-wide basis, without regard to the location of or specific use of parcels of land. Because of this public policy, the capital equipment purchased with impact fees cannot be restricted to the patrol zones or sectors used by the Police Department in assigning personnel for patrol activities. It is, however, herein acknowledged that the Police Department shall have an affirmative duty to ensure that capital equipment purchased with impact fees benefits the payers of those fees. This duty shall require that all new development required to contribute impact fees shall receive patrol services from the Police Department, according to the Level of Service adopted herein. 
(G)  The provision of law enforcement services is acknowledged to be a governmental service provided on a uniform City-wide basis. All new development, as defined herein, creates an impact upon the cost of providing law enforcement services. 
(H)  Providing an adequate level of law enforcement services within the City is essential to and in the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Port St. Lucie. 
(I)  It is the intent of the City Council that impact fees imposed pursuant to this article be used to pay for those capital costs related to the additional law enforcement services required for new development in Port St. Lucie. 
(J)  New development creates an impact on the capital cost of providing law enforcement. The law enforcement impact fee allocates the capital cost of providing law enforcement facilities and capital equipment among various types of land uses and between new development and existing development according to an analysis of law enforcement needs as described in the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013. The provisions of this article relate to adequate law enforcement service and facilities in Port St. Lucie, the law enforcement facilities and capital equipment needed for new development in Port St. Lucie, and the impact fee for those capital costs as based on and supported by the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013. 
(K)  The City Council, after consideration of the technical report and testimony from the public, hereby finds that there exists a rational nexus between the capital costs of providing law enforcement facilities and services and the impact fees imposed on new development by this article. 
(L)  The City Council hereby finds that a rational nexus exists between the impact fees to be collected pursuant to this article, and the expenditure of these funds on capital costs induced by new growth, as limited and prescribed in this article.

Sec. 159.04. - Imposition of Impact Fees; Fee Schedules; Adoption, Review and Revision; Time of Payment. 
    Imposition of Impact Fees: 
(A)  Any person who seeks to make improvements to land which can generate additional demand on law enforcement facilities and services and which requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy or other permit, or who seeks to change the use of land to a use which can generate additional need for law enforcement facilities and capital equipment shall be required to pay a law enforcement impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(B)  No building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit shall be issued or change of use allowed unless and until the law enforcement impact fee hereby required has been paid. 
(C)  The applicant shall pay the applicable impact fee to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, or other permit, or to a change of use. 
(D)  If law enforcement impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type or certificates of occupancy may be issued for the building or structure in question and no construction or change of use allowed while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(E)  A violation of this article is punishable as an ordinance violation as provided in the City Charter and City Code. In addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this article. Knowingly furnishing false information to the City Manager or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this article on any matter relating to the administration of this article constitutes a violation hereof. 
(F)  In the case of structures, mobile homes, recreational vehicles that are moved from one location to another, a law enforcement impact fee will be collected for the new location if the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicle constitutes one of the land development uses listed in section 159.308, regardless of whether law enforcement impact fees had been paid at the old location, unless the use at the new location is a replacement of an equivalent use. If the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicles so moved is replaced by an equivalent use, no law enforcement impact fee is owed for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of law enforcement impact fee equivalency of use rests with the applicant. 
(G)  The amount of the fee shall be determined by the applicable law enforcement impact fee schedule adopted as in this article. The 2013 updated fee schedule is subject to revision based on the provisions of section 159.04. 
(H)  The City Manager shall determine the applicable land use type. 
(1)  If a building or structure is requested for mixed uses, then the impact fee shall be determined through using the applicable fee schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. 
(2)  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied, or change of use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the City Manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land development on the fee schedule. 
(I)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use in accordance with the fee schedule. No impact fee refund will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(J)  If the law enforcement impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it will be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original applicant. If law enforcement impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until law enforcement impact fees are paid. 
(K)  The applicant may submit evidence to the City Manager demonstrating that the law enforcement impact fees set out in this section are not reasonable when applied to the particular development. Based upon convincing and competent evidence the City Manager may adjust the law enforcement impact fee to be reasonable for the particular development. 
(L)  Fee Schedules. 
(1)  Fees Schedule Applicable to Building Permits Issued Prior to Midnight on September 5, 2013. The following fee schedule shall be applicable to all building permits issued prior to midnight on September 5, 2013 and prior to the effective date of Ord. No. 13-24. If the building permit is issued prior to midnight on September 5, 2013 but after the effective date of Ord.

(M)  Classification of Land Uses. The City Manager, or his designee, shall be responsible for determining the appropriate land use categories for all building permits issued by the City of Port St. Lucie. In matters of interpretation, the City Manager, or his designee will consult the Police Department for a recommendation regarding law enforcement impacts associated with a particular type of land use. Such consultations will be limited to those cases where a question exists regarding the correct land use category to which a building permit should be assigned. 
(N)  Adoption, Review and Revision. 
(1)  The City Manager shall direct staff or consultants to annually review the impact fee ordinance, procedures, assumptions, and fee calculations and to issue, on or before July 1, an annual report summarizing information on the impact fees. Information on all impact fees imposed by the City may be included in one annual report. The annual report shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. The annual report should include, for example, information on account balances, annual collections, annual expenditures, capital improvement projects funded in whole or in part with impact fees, administrative costs and administrative fees charged, if any, and may include any other issues of concern related to the City's impact fee system and ordinance. Information from the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), the capital improvements program (CIP) and any other reports or plans adopted by the City may be included by reference or duplicated in part for the annual impact fee report. The annual report should include recommendations related to the impact fee system, including but not limited to, whether there is a need to update the fees based on the ENR construction cost index pursuant to subsection (M), the need for any updates to the impact fee calculations, and the need for any modifications to the ordinance. When increased fees are recommended, the report should include a discussion of affordable housing and how the increase might affect housing affordability. Based upon the annual report, the Council may, but is not required to, direct further action on the impact fee system. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the Council's authority to amend this article at any time. 
(2)  The Council shall, through staff or consultants, conduct a complete review and, if needed, update the law enforcement impact fee study and ordinance at least once every four (4) years. Fee studies should specifically address affordable housing methodologies and/or alternative methods of setting fees, such as tiered impact fees based on square footage for residential fees or reduction of impact fees for in-fill housing or housing in different areas of the City, such as CRA, etc. The report issued based on this review shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. Changes to the impact fee system, including updated fee calculations, should be adopted within a year of completion of the quadrennial report. This quadrennial report shall be issued on or before July 1 in the applicable years and may substitute for the annual report in that year. 
(3)  In conjunction with the annual report, the City Manager shall review the law enforcement impact fee schedule each calendar year to account for changes in the costs of construction and property acquisition. The adjusted fee schedule shall be adopted by ordinance and any increases in the fee schedule shall not be effective prior to ninety (90) days after adoption of such ordinance. Unless otherwise directed by the Council, such annual adjustments to the law enforcement impact fee schedule shall be based on the engineering news record (ENR) construction cost index or such other indexes or computations determined by the City Manager to be suitable for use in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida to reflect the cost of capital facilities and capital equipment for law enforcement.

(B)  Administrative Fee Authorized. The City may charge an additional fee not to exceed three (3) percent to offset the cost of administration, updating, maintaining, and enforcement of this article. The charge shall be based on actual costs. The charge may be established by resolution of the City Council as necessary to conform to this paragraph. Any such administrative charge imposed by the City is in addition to the impact fees due, is nonrefundable, is payable at the time of payment of impact fees, and may include, but is not limited to, costs associated with consultants, administrative staff, equipment, software and other associated expenses. 
(C)  Limitations on Expenditure of Funds Collected. For purposes of this article, the City limits of Port St. Lucie shall constitute a single benefit district to ensure that payers of the law enforcement impact fee receive benefit of funds collected, consistent with the requirements of Florida case law on impact fees. To enable the City to comply with this requirement, all funds collected shall be maintained in an interest bearing separate accounting fund. All equipment-associated manpower will be assigned to the patrol sectors by the chief of police, or his designee, consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors and Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So. 2nd 314 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc., v. Broward County, 446 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc., v.

Said funds shall not be used to repair or maintain any capital equipment or facilities. Funds may be used only for capital costs. All funds collected by the City shall be placed in an interest bearing account until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place. Interest proceeds from these funds will accrue to the law enforcement impact fee separate accounting fund. 
(D)  Audits. Audits of the City performed pursuant to F.S. § 218.39, shall include an affidavit from the chief financial officer of the City stating that the City has complied with F.S. § 163.31801. 
(E)  Impact Agreement. In lieu of payment of fees as calculated in section 159.04, any applicant for a building permit may propose to enter in an impact fee agreement with the City to establish just and equitable fees or in kind contributions appropriate to the specifics of the development at hand. Such an impact fee agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the presumption of impact set forth in section 159.05 by specifying the nature of proposed development for purposes of computing service need generated; providing that the agreement shall establish enforceable means for ensuring that the nature of the development will be substantially as agreed; 
(2)  Provide an impact fee which may differ from that set forth in this article; provided that such estimate shall be based on sufficient law enforcement standards and data, in a form acceptable to the City, to demonstrate that a different fee is appropriate; 
(3)  Provide a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 159.04; provided that the City receives acceptable security ensuring payment of the fees prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such security may take the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or a negotiable certificate of deposit. Liens or mortgages on lands to be covered by the building permit are not acceptable. Any agreement proposed by a developer pursuant to this section of this article must be approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of the building permit. On favorable recommendation by the City Staff, the City Council may approve such agreements only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of new capital equipment and facilities in a just and equitable fashion.

Sec. 159.06. - Credits. 
    The City Council of Port St. Lucie may grant a credit against impact fees imposed by this article for an appropriate private expenditure or contribution which assists the Port St. Lucie Police Department in acquiring new or enhanced capital assets. Such credits may be granted only for contribution which are deemed useful and necessary by the Chief of Police, or his designee, and approved by the City Council. Credits may be granted only for expenditures or contributions of items properly regarded as capital equipment and/or facilities under the definitions used in this article.

(C)  Any reconstruction or replacement of a dilapidated, destroyed, or partially destroyed structure, provided that the replacement structure does not change the land use type designation of the structure being replaced or generate additional need for law enforcement facilities over and above those generated by the original building or structure, provided that there is no change of use of the land and that the new building or structure is permitted; 
(D)  Expansions of, or additions to, existing non-residential structures, provided that such expansion or addition will not require additional law enforcement services, and will not require the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

    In circumstances where a structure is being renovated or remodeled, and when such remodeling is for the purpose of changing the primary use of the structure, law enforcement impact fees shall be collected for the size and new use of the structure less an amount equal to the fee for the previous use and size of the structure. This provision of this article ensures that appropriate credit shall be given to building permit applicants for building square footage already in the Port St. Lucie development inventory.

(3)  Within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the petition for refund, the City Manager, or his designee, shall advise the petitioner and the City Council of the status of the fee requested for refund. For purposes of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed into the special revenue account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account. If administrative charges are adopted by resolution under section 159.05(B), the City shall retain the appropriate fee amount as reimbursement for the City's cost of processing the refund.

Sec. 159.104. - Findings and Declarations. 
(A)  The Council hereby finds that new development in the City requires additional governmental services and facilities, specifically including roads. 
(B)  It is the policy of the City that an adequate level of service in roads will be provided throughout the City concurrent with the impacts of development, so that development will occur in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(C)  It is the policy of the Council that new development should pay a pro rata share of capital costs related to the additional governmental facilities required to accommodate new development. 
(D)  The Council, after consideration of the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, by reference incorporated herein, and the Road Program and the experience of the City and other similarly situated communities, hereby finds that impact fees provide a reasonable method of regulating development in the City so that new development pays a pro rata share of capital costs of governmental facilities necessary to accommodate new development. 
(E)  Providing an adequate level of service for capital facilities is essential to and in the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare of the City of Port St. Lucie. 
(F)  Based on the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005 and the Road Program, the Council hereby finds that a rational nexus, relationship, and connection exists between the capital costs of road improvements made necessary by new development and the impact fees to be imposed on new development and collected pursuant to this article, and between the expenditure of these funds on capital improvements induced by new development and the benefit to the payers of fees. 
(G)  New development creates an impact on the capital cost of providing roads. The "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005 and the Road Program allocate the capital cost of providing roads among various types of land uses and between new development and existing development according to an analysis of road needs as described in the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, and the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005. 
(H)  The provisions of this article relate to adequate roads in Port St. Lucie, the roads needed for new development in Port St. Lucie, and the impact fee for those capital costs are based on and supported by the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005 and the Road Program. 
(I)  Under the provisions of this article, new development shall be required to pay a reasonable pro rata share of the capital costs related to the road improvements made necessary by such new development. New development is not responsible for the public facility needs for existing development and impact fees will not be used to cure existing deficiencies resulting from existing development. 
(J)  It is the policy of the City to provide roads on a City-wide basis. The City has an affirmative duty to ensure that capital improvements paid for with impact fees will be those designated in the Road Program, as may be amended from time to time, determined to be of benefit to the payers of those fees. Therefore impact fees imposed pursuant to this article will be used to pay for those capital costs related to the road improvements that will be required for and benefit new development in Port St. Lucie. The City assumes responsibility for, and will pay from revenues other than impact fees, the costs of the public facility needs of existing development. 
(Ord. No. 05-87, § 4, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.105. - Imposition of Road Impact Fee. 
(A)  Effective October 1, 2005, any person that seeks to make improvements to land which can generate additional traffic and which requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy or other development permit, or who seeks to change the use of land to a use which can produce or attract additional traffic, shall be required to pay a road impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(B)  No building permit, certificate of occupancy or other development permit shall be issued or change of use allowed unless and until the road impact fee hereby required has been paid. 
(C)  The applicant shall pay the applicable impact fee to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, or other development permit, or to a change of use. 
(D)  If road impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type or certificates of occupancy may be issued for the building or structure in question and no construction or change of use allowed while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(E)  A violation of this article is punishable as an ordinance violation as provided in the City Charter and City Code. In addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this article. Knowingly furnishing false information to the City Manager or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this article on any matter relating to the administration of this article constitutes a violation hereof. 
(F)  The City and St. Lucie County were parties to a road impact fee agreement that provides for the City to collect road impact fees within the City pursuant to a County ordinance. The funds collected by the City were shared with the County in accordance with a formula set out in the road impact fee agreement. The road impact fee agreement expired on September 30, 2005. Article VIII of the Florida Constitution provides that a non-charter county ordinance shall not be effective within a municipality that has adopted a municipal ordinance in conflict with the county ordinance. The ordinance adopting this article empowers the City to collect road impact fees and is in conflict with the County ordinance and therefore preempts the County ordinance. Therefore the County road impact fee ordinance is not effective within the City of Port St. Lucie. The City continued to implement the road impact fee agreement between the City and St. Lucie County for so long as it remained in effect until the expiration of the road impact fee agreement on September 30, 2005. 
(Ord. No. 05-87, § 5, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.106. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempt from payment of the road impact fee: 
(A)  Alterations or expansion of an existing building or structure or a change of use where no additional dwelling units will be produced, where the use will not be changed, and where no additional vehicular trips will be generated over and above those generated by the existing building, structure, or use. 
(B)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures or a change of use which will not produce additional vehicular trips over and above those produced by the principal building or use of the land. 
(C)  The replacement of a demolished or partially demolished building or structure with a new building or structure which will not generate additional trips over and above those generated by the original building or structure, provided that there is no change of use of the land and that the new building or structure is permitted. 
(D)  Any claim of exemption must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit for construction or a certificate of occupancy for a change of use. 
(Ord. No. 05-87, § 6, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, 5-28-13; Ord. No. 16-32, § 2, 6-27-16) 
Sec. 159.107. - Accounting and Use of Funds. 
(A)  All funds collected from road impact fees shall be used solely for capital improvements listed in the Road Program, as may be amended. The road impact fee amounts collected may include an additional charge not to exceed three (3) percent to offset the costs of administering, updating, maintaining and enforcing this article. The charge shall be based on actual costs. The charge may be established by resolution of the City Council as necessary to conform to this paragraph. Any such administrative charge imposed by the City is in addition to the impact fees due, is nonrefundable, is payable at the time of payment of impact fees, and may include, but is not limited to, costs associated with consultants, administrative staff, equipment, software, and other associated expenses. 
(B)  The City shall ensure that payers of the road impact fee receive benefit of funds collected, consistent with the requirements of Florida case law on impact fees. All expenditures of impact fee funds shall be consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors and Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc., v. Broward County, 446 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County, 446 So. 2nd 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), cert. denied, 451 So. 2nd 848 (Fla. 1984). 
(C)  All road impact fee funds collected by the City shall be placed in an interest bearing separate accounting fund until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place. Interest proceeds from these funds will accrue to the separate accounting fund. Road impact fee funds shall be used only for those capital improvements specified in the Road Program. Road impact fees shall not be used for periodic or routine maintenance as defined in F.S. § 334.03(19) and (24). 
(D)  Audits of the City performed pursuant to F.S. § 218.39, shall include an affidavit from the chief financial officer of the City stating that the City has complied with F.S. § 163.31801. 
(Ord. No. 05-87, § 7, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, adopted May 28, 2013, amended the title of § 159.107 to read as set out herein. Previously § 159.107 was titled trust account and use of funds. 
Sec. 159.108. - Road Impact Fee Schedule. 
(A)  The amount of the road impact fee shall be determined by the applicable road impact fee schedule adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance. The 2013 updated fee schedule is subject to revision based on the provisions of section 158.109. 
(B)  The City Manager shall determine the applicable land use type. 
(1)  If a building or structure is requested for mixed uses, then the impact fee shall be determined through using the applicable fee schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. 
(2)  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied, or change of use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the City Manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land development on the fee schedule. The City Manager shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) traffic generation studies. 
(C)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use in accordance with the fee schedule. No impact fee refund will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(D)  If the road impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it will be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original applicant. If road impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until road impact fees are paid. 
(E)  The applicant may submit evidence to the City Manager demonstrating that the road impact fees set out in subsection (A)are not reasonable when applied to the particular project. Based upon convincing and competent evidence the City Manager may adjust the road impact fee to be reasonable for the particular project. 
(F)  The applicant may provide a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 159.105; provided that the City receives acceptable security ensuring payment of the fees prior to the issuance of a building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit. Such security may take the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or a negotiable certificate of deposit. Liens or mortgages on lands to be covered by the building permit are not acceptable. Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection must be approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of the building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit. The City Council may approve such agreements only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of new capital facilities in a just and equitable fashion, consistent with the Florida statutory and case law.

Sec. 159.109. - Adoption, Review and Revision. 
(A)  The Council shall adopt all revisions and updates to the Road Program by ordinance. 
(B)  The City Manager shall direct staff or consultants to annually review the impact fee ordinance, procedures, assumptions, and fee calculations and to issue, on or before July 1, an annual report summarizing information on the impact fees. Information on all impact fees imposed by the City may be included in one annual report. The annual report shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. The annual report should include, for example, information on account balances, annual collections, annual expenditures, capital improvement projects funded in whole or in part with impact fees, administrative costs and administrative fees charged, if any, and may include any other issues of concern related to the City's impact fee system and ordinance. Information from the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), the capital improvements program (CIP) and any other reports or plans adopted by the City may be included by reference or duplicated in part for the annual impact fee report. The annual report should include recommendations related to the impact fee system, including but not limited to, whether there is a need to update the fees based on the ENR construction cost Index pursuant to subsection (D) below, the need for any updates to the impact fee calculations, and the need for any modifications to the ordinance. When increased fees are recommended, the report should include a discussion of affordable housing and how the increase might affect housing affordability. Based upon the annual report, the Council may, but is not required to, direct further action on the impact fee system. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the Council's authority to amend this article at any time. 
(C)  The Council shall, through staff or consultants, conduct a complete review and, if needed, update the road impact fee study and the road impact fee ordinance at least once every four (4) years. Fee studies should specifically address affordable housing methodologies and/or alternative methods of setting fees, such as tiered impact fees based on square footage for residential fees or reduction of impact fees for in-fill housing or housing in different areas of the City, such as CRA, etc. The report issued based on this review shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. Changes to the impact fee system, including updated fee calculations, should be adopted within a year of completion of the quadrennial report. This quadrennial report shall be issued on or before July 1 in the applicable years and may substitute for the annual report in that year. 
(D)  In conjunction with the annual report, the City Manager shall review the road impact fee schedule each calendar year to account for changes in the costs of road construction and right-of-way acquisition. The adjusted fee schedule shall be adopted by ordinance and any increases in the fee schedule shall not be effective prior to ninety (90) days after adoption of such ordinance. Unless otherwise directed by the Council, such annual adjustments to the road impact fee schedule shall be based on the engineering news record (ENR) construction cost index or such other indexes or computations determined by the City Manager to be suitable for use, in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida to reflect the cost of capital improvements for roads. 
(Ord. No. 05-87, § 9, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-26, § 2, 5-28-13; Ord. No. 16-32, § 2, 6-27-16) 
Sec. 159.110. - Construction or Donation of Property in Lieu of Impact Fee Payments. 
(A)  In lieu of cash payment of all or part of the road impact fee, the applicant may offer to construct capital improvements, or dedicate right-of-way, or donate property for a capital improvement listed in the Road Program. Such capital improvement or right-of-way or property must be in addition to any capital improvements or right-of-way required pursuant to other regulations, ordinances, laws, or agreements and must only be for a capital improvement or right-of-way that is listed in the Road Program and that meets the requirements set out in section 159.107. The applicant shall submit an estimate of the costs of the proposed capital improvement certified by a registered Florida professional engineer acceptable to the Council and an appraisal of the fair market value of a proposed dedication of right-of-way or donation of property prepared by a state certified general appraiser who is a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI), acceptable to the Council. 
(B)  If it finds the offer acceptable the Council may enter into an agreement with the applicant to apply the cost of the construction of road improvements and fair market value of the right-of-way dedication or property donation to the road impact fee otherwise due. The portion of the fee represented by the construction of road improvements or right-of-way dedication or donation shall be considered paid when the construction, dedication, or donation is completed and accepted by the City (or other governmental entity as may be approved by the City) for maintenance or when adequate security for the completion of the construction has been provided. If road impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(C)  No payment in lieu shall be given for any site-related transportation improvements or site-related right-of-way dedications. Site-related transportation and right-of-way improvements, include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  All driveway connection turn lanes, and other site specific access improvements connecting property owned by the applicant to any impact fee eligible roadway. 
(2)  All driveways, roads and attendant support systems, including but not limited to drainage facilities and mitigation areas, within, or immediately adjacent to, the defined limits of the approved final development order. 
(D)  No payment in lieu shall be given for safety-related improvements which do not increase road capacity. 
(E)  No payment in lieu shall be given for improvements necessary to provide safe and adequate access to the project site. 
(F)  Non site-related capacity improvements may receive payment in lieu only to the extent that they are identified in the Road Program and that they provide increased capacity. 
(G)  In the event a property owner offers to donate right-of-way for a capital improvement designated in the Road Program in advance of an application for development order approval, the City Council may consider the offer and proceed to establish the fair market value of the right-of-way. No right-of-way value determination may include the consideration of any enhancement to the value of property dedicated as a result of the new or expanded roadway right-of-way. The City may accept or reject the offer. The City may accept a property owner's offer only through a written agreement with the property owner consistent with this subsection. 
(H)  Any request for in lieu payments must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived. 
(I)  The City shall not give impact fee credits for impact fees paid, or capital improvements constructed, or dedications of right-of-way or donations of property, except to the extent that such credit was specifically granted by the City to an applicant in a written agreement with the City. If an applicant or successor in interest or predecessor in title has agreed in a written agreement with the City or other governmental agency not to seek or accept any impact fee credits then it shall not be given any impact fee credits, and shall not be eligible for payments in lieu for the construction of capital improvements or the dedication of right-of-way or donation of property required by the agreement. 
(J)  The City may adopt policies and procedures related to the construction or donation of property in lieu of impact fee payment by resolution.

Sec. 159.111. - Refund of Fees Paid. 
(A)  If a building permit or other permit for a mobile home or recreational vehicle expires and no construction has commenced, then the applicant, or its successors may request, within three (3) months of permit expiration, a refund of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance without payment of interest. The refund request should substantially follow the submittal requirements of a refund petition described in subsection (B). If administrative charges are adopted by resolution under section 159.107, the City of Port St. Lucie shall retain the appropriate fee amount as reimbursement for the City's costs of processing the refund. 
(B)  (1)  Any impact fee funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following seven (7) years from the date the road impact fee was paid shall, upon application of the current owner of the property within one hundred eighty (180) days of the expiration of the five (5) year period, be returned to the current owner of the property with interest at the rate of three (3) percent per annum. 
(2)  If such funds have not been spent during this time period, the then-present owner of the property may obtain a refund according to the following procedure: 
(i)  The then-present owner must petition the City Council for a refund within one hundred eighty (180) days of the seven (7) year period. 
(ii)  The petition must be submitted to the City Manager and must include the following: 
(a)  A notarized, sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property; 
(b)  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee; 
(c)  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed; and 
(d)  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill. 
(3)  Within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the petition for refund, the City Manager, or his designee, shall advise the petitioner and the City Council of the status of the fee requested for refund. For purposes of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed into the special revenue account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account. 
(4)  When the money requested is still in the special revenue account and has not been spent or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following seven (7) years from the date the fees were paid, the funds shall be returned with interest at the rate of three (3) percent per annum.

Sec. 159.112. - Appeals. 
(A)  Any decision made by the City Manager in the course of administering the provisions of this article may be appealed to the Council by filing a petition of appeal with the City Clerk within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the rendition of the decision. 
(B)  The Council shall review the petition within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of filing the appeal.

ARTICLE III. - PARKS AND RECREATION IMPACT FEE SCHEDULE 

Sec. 159.201. - Short Title, Authority, and Applicability. 
(A)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Port St. Lucie Park and Recreation Impact Fee Ordinance". 
(B)  The City of Port St. Lucie has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to its home rule powers under its City Charter granted by Article VIII of the Constitution of the State of Florida and Chapter 166 Florida Statutes, and pursuant to other Florida laws, including Sections 163.3201 and 163.3202 Florida Statutes. 
(C)  The City of Port St. Lucie has the power and responsibility to provide parks and recreation facilities in the City. Development within the City impacts the park and recreation facility capital needs of the City. 
(D)  Planning for capital facilities to serve new development that generates additional demand for parks and recreation facilities and the subsequent implementation of these plans, is a responsibility of the City. Moreover, such planning is deemed to be in the best interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the Citizens of the City. 
(Ord. No. 05-86, § 1, 6-20-05) 
Sec. 159.202. - Purpose and intent. 
(A)  This article is intended to implement and be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure the provision of an adequate level of service in parks and recreation facilities throughout the City, so that development may occur in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and with Florida law which requires the provision of public facilities concurrent with the impacts of development. 
(C)  It is also the purpose of this chapter to regulate the use and development of land so as to assure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital improvements that will be necessary to provide parks and recreation facilities to adequately serve the future needs of the City and to implement the Comprehensive Plan.

(Ord. No. 05-86, § 3, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-25, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.204. - Findings and Declarations. 
(A)  The Council hereby finds that new development in the City requires additional governmental services and facilities, specifically including parks and recreation facilities. 
(B)  It is the policy of the City that an adequate level of service in parks and recreation facilities will be provided throughout the City concurrent with the impacts of development, so that development will occur in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(C)  It is the policy of the Council that new development should pay a pro rata share of capital costs related to the additional governmental facilities required to accommodate new development. 
(D)  The Council, after consideration of the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the City of Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, such reports incorporated herein by reference, and the Park Program and the experience of the City and other similarly situated communities, hereby finds that impact fees provide a reasonable method of regulating development in the City so that new development pays a pro rata share of capital costs of governmental facilities necessary to accommodate new development. 
(E)  Providing an adequate level of service within the City is essential to and in the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare of the City of Port St. Lucie. 
(F)  Based on the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the City of Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005 and the Park Program, the Council hereby finds that a rational nexus, relationship, and connection exists between the capital costs of park and recreation facilities improvements made necessary by development and the impact fees to be imposed on new development and collected, pursuant to this article, and between the expenditure of these funds on capital improvements induced by new growth and the benefit to the payers of fees. 
(G)  New development creates an impact on the capital cost of providing parks and recreation facilities. The Park Program allocate the capital cost of providing parks and recreation facilities among various types of residential land uses and between new development and existing development according to an analysis of park and recreation facilities needs as described in the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013 and the City of Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005. 
(H)  The provisions of this article relate to adequate park and recreation facilities in Port St. Lucie, the parks and recreation facilities needed for new development in Port St. Lucie, and the impact fee for those capital costs are based on and supported by the City of Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005 and the Park Program. 
(I)  Under the provisions of this article, development shall be required to pay a reasonable pro rata share of the capital costs related to the parks and recreation facilities made necessary by such new development. New development is not responsible for the public facility needs for existing development and impact fees will not be used to cure existing deficiencies resulting from existing development. 
(J)  It is the policy of the City to provide parks and recreation facilities on a City-wide basis. The City has an affirmative duty to ensure that capital improvements paid for with impact fees will be those designated in the Park Program, as may be amended from time to time, determined to be of benefit to the payers of those fees. Therefore impact fees imposed pursuant to this article will be used to pay for those capital costs related to the parks and recreation facilities that will be required for and benefit development in Port St. Lucie. The City assumes responsibility for, and will pay from revenues other than impact fees, the costs of the park and recreation facility needs of existing development. 
(Ord. No. 05-86, § 4, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-25, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.205. - Imposition of Park and Recreation Impact Fees. 
(A)  Effective October 1, 2005 any person who seeks to make improvements to land which can generate additional demand on parks and recreation facilities and which requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy or other development permit, or who seeks to change the use of land to a use which can generate additional need for parks and recreation facilities shall be required to pay a park and recreation facility impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(B)  No building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit shall be issued or change of use allowed unless and until the park and recreation facility impact fee hereby required has been paid. 
(C)  The applicant shall pay the applicable impact fee to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, or other permit, or to a change of use. 
(D)  If park and recreation facility impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type or certificates of occupancy may be issued for the building or structure in question and no construction or change of use allowed while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(E)  A violation of this article is punishable as an ordinance violation as provided in the City Charter and City Code. In addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this article. Knowingly furnishing false information to the City Manager or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this article on any matter relating to the administration of this article constitutes a violation hereof. 
(F)  The City and St. Lucie County were parties to a park impact fee agreement that provided for the City to collect park impact fees within the City pursuant to a County ordinance. The funds collected by the City were shared with the County in accordance with a formula set out in the park impact fee agreement. The park impact fee agreement expired on September 30, 2005. Article VIII of the Florida Constitution provides that a non-charter county ordinance shall not be effective within a municipality that has adopted a municipal ordinance in conflict with the county ordinance. The ordinance adopting this article empowers the City to collect park and recreation facility impact fees and is in conflict with the County ordinance and therefore preempts the County ordinance. The City continued to implement the park impact fee agreement between the City and St. Lucie County for so long as it remained in effect until the expiration of the park impact fee agreement on September 30, 2005. 
(G)  In the case of structures, mobile homes, recreational vehicles that are moved from one location to another, a park and recreation facility impact fee will be collected for the new location if the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicle constitutes one of the land development uses listed in Section 8, regardless of whether park and recreation impact fees had been paid at the old location, unless the use at the new location is a replacement of an equivalent use. If the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicles so moved is replaced by an equivalent use, no park and recreation impact fee is owed for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of park and recreation facility impact fee equivalency of use rests with the applicant.

Sec. 159.206. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempt from payment of the park and recreation impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations or expansion of an existing building or structure or a change of use where no additional dwelling units will be produced, where the use will not be changed, and where no additional need for park and recreation facilities will be generated over and above those generated by the existing building, structure, or use. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures or change of use which will not generate additional need for park and recreation facilities over and above those generated by the principal building, structure or use of the land. 
(3)  The replacement of a demolished or partially demolished building or structure with a new building or structure which will not generate additional need for park and recreation facilities over and above those generated by the original building or structure, provided that there is no change of use of the land and that the new building or structure is permitted. 
(4)  Any claim of exemption must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 05-86, § 6, 6-20-05; Ord. No. 13-25, § 2, 5-28-13; Ord. No. 16-33, § 2, 6-27-16) 
Sec. 159.207. - Accounting and Use of Funds. 
(A)  All funds collected from park and recreation impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of capital improvements to park and recreation facility capital improvements identified in the Park Program, as may be amended. All park and recreation impact fee funds collected by the City shall be placed in an interest bearing separate accounting fund until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place. Interest proceeds from these funds will accrue to the separate accounting fund. The park and recreation impact fee amounts may include an additional charge not to exceed three (3) percent to offset the costs of administering, updating, maintaining and enforcement of this article. Any such administrative charge imposed by the City is in addition to the impact fees due, is nonrefundable, is payable at the time of payment of impact fees, and may include, but is not limited to costs associated with consultants, administrative staff, equipment, software, and other associated expenses. 
(B)  The City shall ensure that payers of the park and recreation impact fee receive benefit of funds collected, consistent with the requirements of Florida case law on impact fees. All expenditures of impact fee funds shall be consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors and Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc., v. Broward County, 446 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County, 446 So. 2nd 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), cert. denied, 451 So. 2nd 848 (Fla. 1984). 
(C)  All park and recreation impact fee funds collected by the City shall be placed in an interest bearing separate accounting fund until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-25, § 2, adopted May 28, 2013, amended the title of § 159.207 to read as set out herein. Previously § 159.207 was titled trust account and use of funds. 
Sec. 159.208. - Park and Recreation Impact Fee Schedule. 
(A)  The amount of the fee shall be determined by the attached park and recreation impact fee schedules adopted as an exhibit to this article. The 2013 updated fee schedule is subject to revision based upon the provisions of section 159.209. 
(B)  The City Manager shall determine the applicable land use type. 
(1)  If a building or structure is requested for mixed uses, then the impact fee shall be determined through using the applicable fee schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. 
(2)  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied, or change of use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the City Manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land development on the fee schedule. 
(C)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. No impact fee refund will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(D)  If the park and recreation impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it will be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original applicant. If park and recreation impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until park and recreation impact fees are paid. 
(E)  The applicant may submit evidence to the City Manager demonstrating that the park and recreation impact fees set out in subsection (A) are not reasonable when applied to the particular development. Based upon convincing and competent evidence the City Manager may adjust the park and recreation impact fee to be reasonable for the particular development. 
(F)  The applicant may provide a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 159.205; provided that the City receives acceptable security ensuring payment of the fees prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such security may take the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or a negotiable certificate of deposit. Liens or mortgages on lands to be covered by the building permit are not acceptable. Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection must be approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of the building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit. The City Council may approve such agreements only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of new capital facilities in a just and equitable fashion, consistent with the Florida statutory and case law.

(Ord. No. 06-64, § 3, 10-9-06; Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.304. - Findings and Declarations. 
(A)  The Council hereby finds that new development in the City requires additional governmental services and facilities, specifically including public buildings. 
(B)  It is the policy of the City that an adequate level of service in public buildings will be provided throughout the City concurrent with the impacts of development, so that development will occur in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(C)  It is the policy of the Council that new development should pay a pro rata share of capital costs related to the additional governmental facilities required to accommodate new development. 
(D)  The Council, after consideration of the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, and Economic Development Study-2006, such reports incorporated herein by reference, and the public buildings program and the experience of the City and other similarly situated communities, hereby finds that impact fees provide a reasonable method of regulating development in the City so that new development pays a pro rata share of capital costs of governmental facilities necessary to accommodate new development. 
(E)  Based on the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, the Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, and the Economic Development Study-2006 and the public buildings program the Council hereby finds that a rational nexus, relationship, and connection exists between the capital costs of public buildings made necessary by development and the impact fees to be imposed on new development and collected pursuant to this article, and between the expenditure of these funds on capital improvements induced by new growth and the benefit to the payers of fees. 
(F)  New development creates an impact on the capital cost of providing public buildings. The public buildings program allocates the capital cost of providing public buildings among various types of land uses and between new development and existing development according to an analysis of public building needs as described in the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, and Economic Development Study-2006. 
(G)  The provisions of this article relate to adequate public buildings facilities in Port St. Lucie, the public buildings needed for new development in Port St. Lucie, and the impact fee for those capital costs are based on and supported by the "Impact Fee Update - City of Port St. Lucie, Florida" by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic & Planning Consultants dated April 12, 2013, Port St. Lucie Impact Fee Study-2005, Economic Development Study-2006 and the Public Buildings Program. 
(H)  Under the provisions of this article, development shall be required to pay a reasonable pro rata share of the capital costs related to the public buildings made necessary by such new development. New development is not responsible for the public facility needs for existing development and impact fees will not be used to cure existing deficiencies resulting from existing development. 
(I)  It is the policy of the City to provide public buildings on a City-wide basis. The City has an affirmative duty to ensure that capital improvements paid for with impact fees will be those designated in the Public Buildings Program, as may be amended from time to time, determined to be of benefit to the payers of those fees. Therefore impact fees imposed pursuant to this article will be used to pay for those capital costs related to the public buildings that will be required for and benefit development in Port St. Lucie. The City assumes responsibility for, and will pay from revenues other than impact fees, the costs of the public facility needs of existing development. 
(J)  Article VIII of the Florida Constitution provides that a non-charter county ordinance shall not be effective within a municipality that has adopted a municipal ordinance in conflict with the county ordinance. This ordinance empowers the City to collect public building impact fees and is in apparent conflict with the County public building impact fee ordinance. Therefore the County public building impact fee ordinance is not effective within the City of Port St. Lucie to the extent of the conflict. 
(Ord. No. 06-64, § 4, 10-9-06; Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, 5-28-13) 
Sec. 159.305. - Imposition of Public Buildings Impact Fees. 
(A)  Effective October 1, 2005, any person who seeks to make improvements to land which can generate additional demand on public buildings and which requires the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy or other permit, or who seeks to change the use of land to a use which can generate additional need for public buildings shall be required to pay a public buildings impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(B)  No building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit shall be issued or change of use allowed unless and until the public buildings impact fee hereby required has been paid. 
(C)  The applicant shall pay the applicable impact fee to the City prior to the issuance of a building permit, a certificate of occupancy, or other permit, or to a change of use. 
(D)  If public buildings impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type or certificates of occupancy may be issued for the building or structure in question and no construction or change of use allowed while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(E)  A violation of this article is punishable as an ordinance violation as provided in the City Charter and City Code. In addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this article. Knowingly furnishing false information to the City Manager or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this article on any matter relating to the administration of this article constitutes a violation hereof. 
(F)  In the case of structures, mobile homes, recreational vehicles that are moved from one location to another, a public buildings facility impact fee will be collected for the new location if the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicle constitutes one of the land development uses listed in section 159.308, regardless of whether public buildings impact fees had been paid at the old location, unless the use at the new location is a replacement of an equivalent use. If the structure, mobile home or recreational vehicles so moved is replaced by an equivalent use, no public buildings impact fee is owed for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of public buildings impact fee equivalency of use rests with the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 06-64, § 5, 10-9-06; Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, 5-28-13)

    The following shall be exempt from payment of the public buildings impact fee: 
(A)  Alterations or expansion of an existing building or structure or a change of use where no additional dwelling units will be produced, where the use will not be changed, and where no additional need for public buildings will be generated over and above those generated by the existing building, structure, or use. 
(B)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures or change of use which will not generate additional need for public buildings facilities over and above those generated by the principal building, structure or use of the land. 
(C)  The replacement of a demolished or partially demolished building or structure with a new building or structure which will not generate additional need for public buildings facilities over and above those generated by the original building or structure, provided that there is no change of use of the land and that the new building or structure is permitted. 
(D)  Any claim of exemption must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 06-64, § 6, 10-9-06; Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, 5-28-13; Ord. No. 16-34, § 2, 6-27-16) 
Sec. 159.307. - Accounting and Use of Funds. 
(A)  All funds collected from public buildings impact fees shall be used solely for the purpose of public building capital improvements identified in the Public Buildings Program, as may be amended. The public buildings impact fee amounts collected may include an additional charge not to exceed three (3) percent to offset the costs of administering, updating, maintaining and enforcing this article. The charge shall be based on actual costs. The charge may be established by resolution of the City Council as necessary to conform to this paragraph. Any such administrative charge imposed by the City is in addition to the impact fees due, is nonrefundable, is payable at the time of payment of impact fees, and may include, but is not limited to, costs associated with consultants, administrative staff, equipment, software, and other associated expenses. 
(B)  The City shall ensure that payers of the public buildings impact fee receive benefit of funds collected, consistent with the requirements of Florida case law on impact fees. All expenditures of impact fee funds shall be consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors and Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 1976), Hollywood, Inc., v. Broward County, 431 So. 2nd 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), and Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County, 446 So. 2nd 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984), cert. denied, 451 So. 2nd 848 (Fla. 1984). 
(C)  All public buildings impact fee funds collected by the City shall be placed in an interest bearing separate accounting fund until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place. Interest proceeds from these funds will accrue to the public buildings impact fee separate accounting fund. Public buildings impact fee funds shall be used only for those capital improvements specified in the Public Buildings Program. 
(D)  Audits of the City performed pursuant to F.S. § 218.39, shall include an affidavit from the chief financial officer of the City stating that the City has complied with F.S. § 163.31801.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, adopted May 28, 2013, amended the title of § 159.307 to read as set out herein. Previously § 159.307 was titled trust account and use of funds. 
Sec. 159.308. - Public Buildings Impact Fee Schedule. 
(A)  The amount of the fee shall be determined by the applicable public building impact fee schedule adopted as an exhibit to this article. The 2013 updated fee schedule is subject to revision based on the provisions of section 159.309. 
(B)  The City Manager shall determine the applicable land use type. 
(1)  If a building or structure is requested for mixed uses, then the impact fee shall be determined through using the applicable fee schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. 
(2)  If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied, or change of use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the City Manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land development on the fee schedule. 
(C)  In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use in accordance with the fee schedule. No impact fee refund will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(D)  If the public buildings impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it will be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original applicant. If public buildings impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until public buildings impact fee are paid. 
(E)  The applicant may submit evidence to the City Manager demonstrating that the public buildings impact fees set out in subsection (a) are not reasonable when applied to the particular development. Based upon convincing and competent evidence the City Manager may adjust the public buildings impact fee to be reasonable for the particular development. 
(F)  The applicant may provide a schedule and method for payment of the fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 159.305; provided that the City receives acceptable security ensuring payment of the fees prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such security may take the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or a negotiable certificate of deposit. Liens or mortgages on lands to be covered by the building permit are not acceptable. Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection must be approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of the building permit, certificate of occupancy, or other permit. The City Council may approve such agreements only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of new capital facilities in a just and equitable fashion, consistent with the Florida statutory and case law.

(A)  The Council shall adopt all revisions and updates to the Public Buildings Program by ordinance. 
(B)  The City Manager shall direct staff or consultants to annually review the impact fee ordinance, procedures, assumptions, and fee calculations and to issue, on or before July 1, an annual report summarizing information on the impact fees. Information on all impact fees imposed by the City may be included in one annual report. The annual report shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. The annual report should include, for example, information on account balances, annual collections, annual expenditures, capital improvement projects funded in whole or in part with impact fees, administrative costs and administrative fees charged, if any, and may include any other issues of concern related to the City's impact fee system and ordinance. Information from the comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR), the capital improvements program (CIP) and any other reports or plans adopted by the City may be included by reference or duplicated in part for the annual impact fee report. The annual report should include recommendations related to the impact fee system, including but not limited to, whether there is a need to update the fees based on the ENR construction cost index pursuant to subsection (D), the need for any updates to the impact fee calculations, and the need for any modifications to the ordinance. When increased fees are recommended, the report should include a discussion of affordable housing and how the increase might affect housing affordability. Based upon the annual report, the Council may, but is not required to, direct further action on the impact fee system. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the Council's authority to amend this article at any time. 
(C)  The Council shall, through staff or consultants, conduct a complete review and, if needed, update the public buildings impact fee study and ordinance at least once every four (4) years. Fee studies should specifically address affordable housing methodologies and/or alternative methods of setting fees, such as tiered impact fees based on square footage for residential fees or reduction of impact fees for in-fill housing or housing in different areas of the City, such as CRA, etc. The report issued based on this review shall be distributed to the Council by the City Manager. Changes to the impact fee system, including updated fee calculations, should be adopted within a year of completion of the quadrennial report. This quadrennial report shall be issued on or before July 1 in the applicable years and may substitute for the annual report in that year. 
(D)  In conjunction with the annual report, the City Manager shall review the public buildings impact fee schedule each calendar year to account for changes in the costs of construction and property acquisition. The adjusted fee schedule shall be adopted by ordinance and any increases in the fee schedule shall not be effective prior to ninety (90) days after adoption of such ordinance. Unless otherwise directed by the Council, such annual adjustments to the public buildings impact fee schedule shall be based on the engineering news record (ENR) construction cost index or such other indexes or computations determined by the City Manager to be suitable for use in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida to reflect the cost of public buildings construction and land acquisition. 
(Ord. No. 06-64, § 9, 10-9-06; Ord. No. 13-24, § 2, 5-28-13; Ord. No. 16-34, § 2, 6-27-16)

(B)  If it finds the offer acceptable the Council may enter into an agreement with the applicant to apply the cost of the construction of public buildings capital improvements and the fair market value of the property dedication or donation to the public buildings impact fee otherwise due. The portion of the fee represented by the construction of public buildings or property dedication or donation shall be considered paid when the construction, dedication, or donation is completed and accepted by the City (or other governmental entity as may be approved by the City) for maintenance or when adequate security for the completion of the construction has been provided. If public buildings impact fees are owed, no development permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question while the fee remains unpaid. The City Manager may authorize the initiation of any action as permitted by law or equity to collect the unpaid fees. 
(C)  The City shall not give impact fee credits for impact fees paid, or capital improvements constructed, or dedications or donations of property, except to the extent that such credit was specifically granted by the City to an applicant in a binding written agreement with the City. If an applicant or successor in interest or predecessor in title has agreed in a binding written agreement with the City or other governmental agency not to seek or accept any impact fee credits then it shall not be given impact fee credits, or be eligible for in lieu payments, for the construction of capital improvements or the dedication or donation of property required by the agreement. 
(D)  The City may adopt policies and procedures related to construction or donation of property in lieu of impact fee payments by resolution.

(A)  Imposition of impact fees pursuant to Section 159 of this Code may place the City in a non-competitive position with other local governments that have chosen not to require growth to pay its fair share of needed capital facilities, thus hindering efforts by the City and the community to encourage economic development opportunities within the City and to create permanent employment expansion opportunities for the City's residents. 
(B)  The purpose of the economic development impact fee mitigation program is to mitigate any real or perceived disadvantage occurring from the imposition of impact fees to certain Qualified Target Industry Businesses. 
(C)  This program is not intended as an entitlement program. The program is intended to provide the City Council the opportunity, in its sole discretion, to grant impact fee mitigation to Qualified Target Industry Businesses. 
(Ord. No. 17-80, § 2, 11-27-17) 
Sec. 159.503. - Definitions. 
(A)  Qualified Target Industry Business: A new or expanding business in the City that has a positive economic and fiscal impact on the City and meets the requirements of F.S. § 288.106, or its statutory successor in function, as a qualified target industry business.

CHAPTER 160. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, adopted Apr. 12, 1999, repealed and replaced chapter 160 in its entirety to read as herein set out. 

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 160.01. - Introduction. 
(A)  On February 9, 1998, the City Council adopted the City's revised and updated Comprehensive Plan. The adoption of the Comprehensive Plan was required by the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. ch. 163, pt. II, as amended, a primary objective of which is to effectively manage the problems associated with Florida's rapid population growth. A key element of the act (F.S. § 163.3177(10)(H)) is the concept of "concurrency" expressed as follows: 
"It is the intent of the Legislature that public facilities and services needed to support development shall be available concurrent with the impacts of such development." 
(B)  The act accordingly required that each local government adopt locally acceptable levels of service (LOS) for its various public facilities and services (roads, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water, parks and recreation, and mass transit, if applicable) and then provide for the capital improvements necessary to maintain those adopted levels of service. In addition, the act (F.S. § 163.3202(2)(G)) prohibits local government from issuing: 
"A development order or permit which results in a reduction in the service for the affected public facilities below the level of service provided in the Comprehensive Plan of the local government." 
(C)  This section of the act is required to be implemented through the adoption of local land development regulations. The act (F.S. § 163.3177(3)(B)) also requires that the capital improvements element of the Comprehensive Plan "shall be reviewed on an annual basis and modified as necessary." 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.02. - Purpose and Intent. 
(A)  The Concurrency Management System will provide the necessary regulatory mechanism for evaluating development orders to ensure that adequate public facilities and services are available concurrent with development impacts. The adoption of the Port St. Lucie Comprehensive Plan and its various elements established acceptable level of service standards for roads, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, and parks and recreation facilities. 
(B)  An additional component of the Concurrency Management System is the establishment of a framework for determining public facility, and service needs and providing a basis for meeting those needs through capital improvements planning. The capital improvements element in the Comprehensive Plan identifies the schedule of capital facility projects and funding mechanisms currently necessary to maintain adequate public facilities and services at or above the adopted level of service standards. 
(C)  The Concurrency Management System, in accordance with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3203(2)(G), and F.A.C. § 9J-24.003(1)(H) and § 9J-S.0055, is intended to implement the City's Comprehensive Plan and specifically address the requirements outlined in the following elements of the plan: future land use, traffic circulation, infrastructure, coastal management, recreation and open space, intergovernmental coordination, and capital improvements elements. 
(D)  The implementation of the Concurrency Management System will serve as the principal mechanism for ensuring that future growth is managed in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan as well as provide a key monitoring device for measuring the effectiveness of the Comprehensive Plan and the programming of future capital improvements. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.03. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Secs. 160.04-160.19. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW SYSTEM 

Sec. 160.20. - Establishment of Procedures. 
    The order to ensure that adequate public facilities area available concurrent with when the impacts of development occur on each public facility, the City shall establish the following development review procedures to ensure that no development orders are issued unless adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed development, or that the development order is conditioned on the availability of public facilities to serve the development concurrent with the impacts of development. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.21. - Certificate of Concurrency (COC). 
    Approval to develop land and structures must include assurances for the adequate provision of public facilities and services to serve the development. The City will verify the adequacy of public facilities and services in the Concurrency Management System with a "certification of level of service concurrency" otherwise known as "Certificate of Concurrency" (COC). Issuance of a final local development order shall serve as certification of concurrency. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.22. - General. 
    After the effective date of these regulations, a valid, unexpired Certificate of Concurrency (COC) shall be required prior to, or in conjunction with, approval of a final development order (a DRI or the earliest or next to occur of a final subdivision plat, final site development plan, or building permit), provided, however, any development orders except a final local development order may be approved or issued provided they are expressly conditioned on the issuance of a COC prior to building permit approval, and provided the owner and applicant proceed at their own risk and expressly waive and release the City in writing from any and all future claims of vested rights and equitable estoppel resulting from such approval. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.23. - Public Facilities Requiring LOS Concurrency Analysis. 
    The following public facilities shall require level of service "concurrency" analysis for the units and standards indicated: 
(A)  Traffic Circulation. Average annual daily traffic count capacity on major roadways functionally classified as arterials and collectors by the Comprehensive Plan and site development performance design standards. 
(B)  Parks and Recreation Facilities. Proportional City capacity per one thousand (1,000) residents. 
(C)  Sanitary Sewer Facilities. Proportional City serving wastewater treatment capacity for each treatment plant, and site development performance standards (re: septic tanks/wells). 
(D)  Potable Water Facilities. Proportional city-serving water treatment capacity for each treatment plant, and site development performance standards (re: septic tanks/wells). 
(E)  Stormwater Management Facilities. Site development performance standards. 
(F)  Solid Waste Facility. Proportional, City-serving volume capacity of the landfill. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.24. - Development Orders Requiring a Certificate of Concurrency (COC). 
    For the purpose of meeting the provisions of the Concurrency Management System, a development order if not an exception to compliance or ineligible for certification shall be considered to be any action required by the City Comprehensive Plan, zoning and land development regulations, and other applicable ordinances for approval of the following: 
(A)  Developments of Regional Impact (DRI) or Florida Quality Development (FQD); 
(B)  Final subdivision plat, final development plan or final site plan (including construction plans); 
(C)  Major earthmoving permit; 
(D)  Request for public water or wastewater service; and, 
(E)  Building permit for following: 
(1)  More than five hundred (500) square feet of nonresidential floor area as either a whole building or an addition. 
(2)  Dwelling unit as a whole unit but not as an addition to a unit. 
(3)  Any other use that after construction would increase trip generation, stormwater runoff, potable water use, waste water generation, or solid waste generation beyond that of a typical dwelling unit or five hundred (500) square foot office. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.25. - Other Eligible Development Orders for COC. 
    At the applicant's request, the City shall review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for development approval for any eligible COC development order needed for a proposed development prior to receipt of a final local development order approval. Eligible development orders include the following: 
(A)  Preliminary subdivision plat, preliminary development plan or preliminary site plan; 
(B)  Rezoning request conditioned by a site plan; or 
(C)  Special exception use request conditioned by a site plan. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.26. - Timing. 
    An application for COC for eligible development orders may be submitted at any time. The various times for application all carry different risks. Applying for a COC with a preliminary plan provides security throughout subsequent stages of development approval and preparation. However, these stages must move rapidly enough to obtain a building permit before the COC expires (three (3) years for most cases). On the other hand, applying for a COC with the final plan, phased application or building permit gambles on adequacy later in the development approval process. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.27. - Exemptions to Certificate of Concurrency. 
    Certain development orders and developments qualify for an exemption from the requirement for a COC if one (1) of the following development orders or if the development meets any of the following conditions: 
(A)  Development rights "vested" by a judicial determination, but only to the extent stated in the court order and verified by the City Attorney; 
(B)  Development rights "vested" by a Vested Rights Determination of the City Council, but only to the extent stated in the determination and verified by the City Attorney; 
(C)  All valid, unexpired final DRI development orders which were issued prior to adoption of these regulations, except where: 
(1)  Development conditions or stipulations applicable to concurrency, or the provision of adequate public facilities concurrent with the impacts of development, exist in the DRI development order; 
(2)  Substantial deviations are sought for a DRI development order, and then, these regulations shall apply only to those portions of the development for which the deviation is sought; 
(3)  An overriding concern for public health, safety, or welfare exists; 
(4)  The City can demonstrate pursuant to F.S. § 380.06, that substantial changes in the conditions underlying the approval of the development order have occurred or the development order was based on substantially inaccurate information provided by the developer or that the application of these regulations to the development order is clearly established to be essential to the public health, safety and welfare; or 
(5)  The new requirements would not so change or alter a DRI development order that they would materially or substantially affect the developer's ability to complete the development authorized by the DRI development order; 
(D)  All valid, unexpired final local development orders issued prior to adoption of these regulations; 
(E)  Construction of Public Facilities that are consistent with the City of Port St. Lucie Comprehensive Plan; 
(F)  Any development orders determined by the Director of Planning and Zoning not to impact public facilities; 
(G)  Original temporary construction and development permits and any subsequent renewals not to exceed a cumulative period of one (1) year;

(I)  All temporary use permits. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.28. - Ineligible for Certificate of Concurrency. 
(A)  Certain development orders do not directly authorize development to commence or do not demand a final assessment of public facilities. Some have no expiration. Eventual development arising from them would require subsequent development orders subject to a COC. Therefore, the following development orders authorizations, approvals or instruments, which do not directly authorize development, shall not receive a COC: 
(1)  Administrative appeal; 
(2)  Comprehensive Plan and/or Future Land Use Plan Map amendments; 
(3)  Zoning amendment and/or Special Exception Use request not conditioned on a site plan; 
(4)  Conceptual subdivision plat, conceptual development plan, or conceptual site plan; 
(5)  Flood hazard variance; 
(6)  Tree removal permit; 
(7)  Variance or adjustment; 
(8)  Temporary use permit; 
(9)  Sign permit;

(1)  The Planning and Zoning Department in conjunction with the St. Lucie County Solid Waste Department shall evaluate solid waste levels of service; 
(2)  The Transportation Division of the Engineering Department shall evaluate roadway levels of service. For large scale projects, the Planning and Zoning Department may refer applications to the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for technical review and comments of traffic impact reports, and consider their comments in project recommendations. 
(3)  The Stormwater Management Division of the Engineering Department shall evaluate drainage levels of service. 
(4)  The Planning and Zoning Department in conjunction with the appropriate fire district (re: fire flow pressure) and St. Lucie West Utilities, Inc. or City Utilities Department shall evaluate potable water levels of service; 
(5)  The Planning and Zoning Department, in conjunction with St. Lucie West Utilities, Inc. or City Utilities Department, shall evaluate sanitary sewer levels of service (the St. Lucie County Health Department is responsible for septic tank permits and approval of potable water wells); and 
(6)  The Planning and Zoning Department in conjunction with the Parks and Recreation Department shall evaluate parks and recreation levels of service. 
(C)  (1)  The evaluating agencies, departments or divisions, or providers shall provide the coordinating departments or divisions a letter or other instrument for each proposed development order which indicates the existing level of service of facilities and services which will be impacted by the proposed development, the extent of the impact generated by the proposed development, and whether those facilities and services have sufficient capacity to serve the development at, or above, adopted levels of service. 
(2)  By the March 1 of each year each evaluating agency, department or division, or provider, as appropriate, shall provide to the Director of Planning and Zoning a Yearly Information Report which describes the previous year's level of service, capacity at beginning of previous year, capacity reserved through the issuance of COC's, any capacity freed through the expiration of COC's, available capacity for the next year, and any specifics relative to planned or completed expansion of facilities and facility capacity. The Director of Planning and Zoning shall provide the appropriate information to the coordinating departments or divisions, including reporting committed trips on roadways to the MPO for inclusion in traffic count data and analysis. 
(D)  The coordinating departments or divisions will be responsible for compiling the level of service reviews from each evaluating agency, department or division into a concurrency report for each development order. Each concurrency report shall document the following: 
(1)  The conditions related to land uses and public facility availability upon which the reviews were based; 
(2)  The specific facilities impacted by the proposed development; 
(3)  The extent of the impact generated on those facilities by the proposed development; 
(4)  Conditions or stipulations regarding the timing and phasing of the development or provision of facility improvements necessary to ensure that adequate facilities will be available concurrent with the impact of development; and 
(5)  Consideration of any proposed congestion management strategy to mitigate traffic impacts. 
(E)  For each development order reviewed for concurrency, the coordinating department or division shall be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the conditions and stipulations contained in all concurrency reports that were completed during earlier steps of the development review process which are related to that development order, in order to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary duplication. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.30. - Subsequent Development Orders. 
    A final local development order shall receive final approval only to the extent to which the proposed development receives a COC. If a development order requires subsequent development orders (e.g., a preliminary plat followed by a final plat followed by a building permit), then the original COC will serve all such subsequent development orders subject to the following: 
(A)  So long as subsequent development orders would not grant additional capacity reservations; and 
(B)  Project is continuing toward completion with no more than six-months passing between an approval stage and submittal of an application for the next required approval, unless an approved extension has been granted. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.31. - Assignability and Transferability. 
    A COC shall run with the land, shall be assignable within a proposed development, and shall not be assignable or transferable to other development. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.32. - Modification of Certificate of Concurrency. 
    Applicants may request modifications which would not grant additional capacity reservations ahead of denied but still pending applications waiting for future capacities. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.33. - Expiration of Certificate of Concurrency. 
    Development of the project (or phase) may proceed only if it has a valid and unexpired building permit before the COC expires. 
(A)  The COC will expire no earlier than the earliest of the following: 
(1)  Three (3) years from the date of issuance, except to the extent that building permits have been issued for the proposed development for which the COC was approved, and the proposed development is then completed pursuant to the terms of the Port St. Lucie Building Code; or 
(2)  Five (5) years from the date of issuance for development comprised of more than five hundred (500) dwelling units, or for a phased increment of development comprised of more than one hundred fifty (150) dwelling units, or for a commercial or industrial development of more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet GLA, except to the extent that building permits have been issued for the proposed development for which the COC was approved, and the proposed development is then completed pursuant to the terms of the Port St. Lucie Building Code, provided the COC holder: 
a.  Obtains approval of its final subdivision plat or final site development plan within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of the COC; 
b.  Commences construction of the infrastructure for the final subdivision plat or final site development plan within twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance of the COC; and 
c.  Completes the construction of the infrastructure for the final subdivision plat (and records final plat) or final site development plan within thirty-six (36) months from the date of issuance of the COC; or 
[For purposes of determining the expiration of a COC for a mixed use development, the size of the mixed use development shall be determined by aggregating the percentage of the threshold for each land use component that is proposed for the mixed use development.] 
(3)  Expiration of the development order plus permitted extensions and renewals. 
(B)  (1)  The COC's expiration date may exceed the otherwise normal three (3) years from the date of its issuance and occur at a negotiated date for any of the following: 
a.  Development of Regional Impact (DRI) or a Florida Quality Development (FQD), or phase thereof; or 
b.  Local government land development agreement (F.S. § 163.3220) secured project, or phase thereof. 
(2)  Upon approval by the City Council, any applicant may enter into a development agreement with the City in conjunction with the approval of a development order and/or Certificate of Concurrency. The effect of the development agreement shall be to bind the parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the development agreement and the COC in order to ensure that adequate public facilities are available to serve the proposed development concurrent with the impacts of development. 
(3)  Development agreements may address conditional development order approvals and conditions for renewal of the COC beyond five (5) years, however, the duration of any COC shall not exceed five (5) years. Development agreements may also provide for private provision of public facilities or for a joint endeavor between the private sector and the City to provide public facilities. Other methodologies for concurrency exceptions per F.A.C. § 91-5.005, may be utilized as a part of development agreements. Any public facility in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or CIP on which such a COC is made in conjunction with the approval of a development order and a development shall not be delayed, deferred, or removed from the five-year schedule of improvements in the CIE or CIP. 
(4)  The development order must be based on a detailed analysis of the public facility impacts of the project to determine any fair-share mitigation (e.g., a developer's front-end capital contribution or payment of impact fees), such contribution may effectively reserve the capacity of that contribution for the developer's future use. 
(C)  In addition to the above, subdivision plats have special provisions as follows: 
(1)  An improved and platted subdivision will remain certified for home building until its certificate expires; then, the developer may apply for another COC for the entire subdivision or any phase or home site separately. Long-term negotiated agreements and certification would depend on the developer investing in front-end capital contribution to reserve capacities beyond the normal three-year certification. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.34. - Effect. 
(A)  Issuance of a COC shall demonstrate proof of adequate public facilities to serve the development approved in the development order, subject to the conditions in the development order. A subsequent application for development approval for which a COC has been previously approved shall be determined to have adequate public facilities as long as the COC is valid and unexpired. 
(B)  Developers should not rely on any development order or other assurances if development does not commence and continue to completion. The City cannot allow unpredictable delays which would effectively reserve capacities indefinitely, especially when other development proposals could move ahead. Capacities remain reserved only for developments with assured and timely readiness for occupancy. 
(C)  The Certificate of Concurrency (COC), if not used for development within its effective period (three (3) years for most cases), then it expires completely. The procedure for the COC offers no opportunity for extension or renewal. A subsequent application for the same project will place the proposed development at the end of the lines of other developments waiting for approval. The nonrenewable feature prevents hoarding, protects the competitive development market, and assures opportunities to satisfy projected growth. 
(D)  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all COC's approved or issued from the date that the Director of Planning and Zoning releases the YIR to the public through the date that the approved boundaries and the annual residual capacity trip allotments for each CAOC becomes effective shall be expressly conditioned upon any and all restrictions, limitations, provisions, boundaries and allotments adopted by the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.35. - Remedies for Denied or Pending Certificates of Concurrency. 
(A)  Administrative or legal remedies through appeal. 
(B)  Pending applications may have development orders and permits which include conditions on the availability of facilities necessary to serve the proposed developments (e.g., development agreements, planning and phasing; facility phasing; capital improvements programming; and DRI's). These conditions may include: 
(1)  Agreements with the local government allows developers to correct deficiencies by building facilities themselves or contributing to the funding of capital improvements. 
(2)  Phasing a project allows construction in stages which follow the progressive improvement of facilities over time. 
(3)  Careful planning of a project with knowledge of public construction schedules will assist the development community. 
(4)  Petitions to amend the Comprehensive Plan's Capital Improvement Element may request enlargements of public facilities to accommodate the impact of proposed developments, change in facility phasing schedule, lower level of service standards, or increased funding sources (assessments, impact fees, and the like). 
(5)  Approved Congestion Management Strategies which mitigate traffic impact. 
(C)  More importantly, however, City staff must have foresight in preparing for urban growth in order to assure adequate public facilities concurrent with the impacts of development without excessive cost or undue delay.

ARTICLE IV. - DETERMINATION OF CONCURRENCY, GENERALLY 

Sec. 160.65. - Review Process. 
(A)  Consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and this Code, the approval of final local development orders, not including vested development, ineligible orders or exceptions, shall be contingent upon a finding that adequate public facilities have been determined to be available, consistent with their adopted levels of service and concurrent with the impact of the proposed development. 
(B)  After the effective date of these regulations, a valid, unexpired Certificate of Concurrency (COC) shall be obtained in conjunction with the review of the earliest or next to occur of: 
(1)  Final subdivision plat; 
(2)  Final site development plan; or 
(3)  Building permit. 
(C)  Provided, however, that an owner or developer may apply for approval of any development order or Certificate of Concurrency under the following conditions: 
(1)  An application for a Certificate of Concurrency may be submitted at any time concurrent with an application for approval of an eligible development order; 
(2)  Any development order, except a final local development order, may be approved or issued provided issuance of a COC occurs prior to, or in conjunction with, final local development order approval. 
(D)  Such a determination of concurrency shall be made during the review of a development order as part of an application for a Certificate of Concurrency (COC). The Certificate of Concurrency is normally valid for a period of three (3) years following its date of issuance, and a finding of concurrency made for one (1) development order will serve all such subsequent development orders provided that: 
(1)  The previously approved development order remains in effect, as determined by that time limit imposed upon the development by the applicable section of the City Zoning Regulations or these regulations; 
(2)  The impact of the proposed development under consideration was fully taken into account during the COC review and in the finding of "concurrence" associated with the previously approved development order; 
(3)  The conditions related to the land uses and facility availability upon which the previous finding of "concurrence" was based have not changed; and 
(4)  All conditions or stipulations regarding the timing of phasing of the development or the provisions of facility improvement by either the developer or the City imposed on the previously approved development order have been satisfied. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.66. - Determination of Capacity. 
    For the purpose of evaluating development orders, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(A)  Adding together: 
(1)  Total capacity of existing facilities; 
(2)  The total capacity of new facilities, if any, that will become available concurrent with the impacts of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted if one (1) or more of the following provisions will be met: 
a.  For potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage: 
1.  The new facilities and services will be in place at the time the applicable development permit is issued; 
2.  Construction of the new facilities will be underway at the time the applicable development permit is issued; or 
3.  The new facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract or developer's agreement for construction of the facilities or the provision of services to be in place when the impacts of the applicable development occur; or 
4.  The new facilities and services are guaranteed to be in place or under construction at the time the applicable development permit is issued or in place when the impacts of the applicable development occur through an enforceable development agreement for the development under consideration. 
b.  For parks and recreation, in addition to a.1.-4. above: 
1.  The new facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of construction of the facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development permit; or 
2.  The new facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires the commencement of construction of the facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development permit. 
c.  For transportation facilities including roads, in addition to a.1.-4. and b.1.-2. above: 
1.  The new facilities and services have been included in the adopted City of Port St. Lucie Five-Year Capital Improvement Element and Programs, or County CIE (Capital Improvement Element) or FDOT (Florida Department of Transportation) work program plans if applicable, in accordance with Rule 9J-5. 0055(2)(C) and Rule 9J-5.016, and that construction of the facilities is scheduled to commence in or before the third year of the five-year schedule of capital improvements. 
2.  Any approved Congestion Management Strategy which mitigates traffic impacts. 
d.  For potable water, sewer, solid waste, drainage, parks and recreation, and roads, in addition to a. or b. or c. above: 
1.  Any new facilities and services which are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement for a development different than the one (1) under consideration, provided that the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities with a construction start date during the fiscal year in effect at the time the development order is being evaluated. 
(B)  Subtracting from the total capacity the sum of: 
(1)  The demand for the facilities and services created by existing development; 
(2)  The estimated demand for the facilities and services created by "vested" development which are determined to be exempt from the COC requirement; 
(3)  The demand for the facilities and services created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments for which development orders and COC's have been approved; and 
(4)  The demand for the facilities and services anticipated to be created by the completion of the proposed development under consideration for approval of a Certificate of Concurrency. Consideration of de minimus exceptions can be considered per criteria of rule 91-5 F.A.C. 
(Ord. No. 99-19, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 160.67. - Management and Monitoring Program. 
Concurrency Data Base Requirements: 
(1)  Responsibilities. The Director of Planning and Zoning shall be responsible for developing and maintaining any inventory of, vested developments, based upon development order approvals, in order to support appropriate City agencies, departments or divisions engaged in development order, Certificate of Concurrency, and permit review; monitoring the impact of development order approvals on the availability of public facilities; and in the planning and/or provision of public facilities. This information shall be provided to the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for inclusion in traffic count data and analysis. 
(2)  Updating. This data will be updated annually and will be designed to provide incremental data pertaining to existing, vested, approved and planned development, as follows: 
a.  The public facility impact of development existing or vested at the time of formation or update of the data base, plus the total impact of approved and/or projected or phased future development orders; 
(3)  Yearly Information Report (YIR). 
a.  By May 1 of each year, the Director of Planning and Zoning shall complete an inventory report on public facilities (YIR) based on the annual reports of evaluating agencies, departments or divisions, or providers. The YIR shall determine the existing conditions of all capital potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, park and road public facilities, determine and summarize the available capacity of these capital facilities based on their LOS, and forecast the capacity of existing and planned public facilities identified in the CIP and CIE Five-Year Capital Improvement Schedule. The forecasts shall be based on the most recently adopted schedule of capital improvement for each public facility. The YIR shall be based on the most recent City population projects, public facility inventories, unit costs, and analysis of traffic count data. 
b.  The findings of the YIR shall form the basis, in part, of the annual update to the CIP and CIE, any proposed projects to be included in the City's tentative annual budget, the determination of a critical area of concurrence (CAOC), and the review of, and issuance of, development orders during the next year. 
(4)  Annual Determination of Adequate Public Facilities. Based on the findings of the YIR by May 1 of each year, the Director of Planning and Zoning will report to the City Manager and City Departments concerning deficiencies or potential deficiencies in concurrent public facilities. Reviewing agencies and departments shall take remedial action, as needed, based on the findings of the report, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Establishment of critical areas of concurrence (CAOC); 
b.  Public facility project additions to the CIE and CIP; 
c.  Deferral of development order issuance in affected areas pending: 
1.  Lowering of LOS via Comprehensive Plan Amendment; 
2.  Inclusion of necessary public facility projects in the CIP and CIE; 
3.  Approval of new or increased revenue sources for needed public facility projects; or 
4.  Commitment of private funds to remedy the facility needs. 
(5)  Recommendations on the Annual CIE/CIP Update and Tentative Annual Budget. Based upon analysis of the YIR, changes will be considered to the annual update to the CIP and CIE in conjunction with the release of the City's tentative annual budget, which will include the public facilities needed to maintain adopted level of service standards. 
(6)  Identification of Potentially Deficient Public Facilities. Each public facility shall be reviewed relative to identifying and establishing the approximate percentage of capacity level when specific inclusion of improvements in the CIE and CIP would be required in order to maintain adopted LOS standards concurrent with projected development. 
(7)  Critical Areas of Concurrency (CAOC) of Roads. If the findings of the YIR identify additional needed road improvements, they will be included in the transportation facilities component of the proposed annual CIE/CIP update. Any deficient or potentially deficient transportation facility, including a road segment, shall be potentially considered a critical area of concurrency. 
a.  The Director of Planning and Zoning will determine if there is either a deficient (including backlogged or constrained) or potentially deficient road segment based upon available traffic count data as provided by the MPO (Metropolitan Planning Organization) as compared to adopted level of service standards. 
b.  The Engineering Department (in conjunction with the MPO) shall complete a detailed analysis of the deficient or potentially deficient road segment and determine the best solution to mitigate each proposed CAOC. The analysis shall take into consideration characteristics of the road segment (such as traffic control, signal spacing, timing and phasing) using procedures documented in the current edition of the Highway Capacity Manual and the Highway System Plan Level of Service Standards and Guidelines Manual. In mitigation proposals, the county's congestion management system technical analysis shall be considered as a possible alternative mitigation solution. 
c.  The annual residual capacity trips covering the potentially deficient road segment shall be based upon up to one hundred (100%) percent of the potentially deficient road segment's remaining capacity, measured in average annual daily trips, plus a maximum of ten (10%) percent above the level of service volume and maintained or improved through Transportation System Management (TSM) and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures; or for FDOT backlogged road segments remaining capacity plus up to five (5%) percent volume through the end of the fiscal year indicated for improvement. 
(8)  Criteria for City Council Approval of Deficient Road Segments and Critical Areas of Concurrency. When any City arterial or collector road or segment of such a road is determined or allowed to be operating one (1) level of service below its adopted standard, the City shall exercise one (1) of the following options: 
a.  Enter into a contract that will result in addition of capacity to the facility within six (6) months of the determination that the facility is operating below its level of service standard, and delay issuance of development orders affecting such roadway until the contract has been executed; 
b.  Enter into an enforceable development agreement that specified that new development will provide for the upgraded facility; 
c.  Amend the Comprehensive Plan to lower the level of service at the next opportunity; 
d.  Not issue any development permits in the impacted area; 
e.  Commit to schedule and fund the improvement within three (3) years of the project's certificate of occupancy date and designate as such in the next years capital improvements program; or 
f.  Approval of an agreement between the developer and the City to implement a congestion management strategy to alleviate capacity deficiencies created by the proposed development. 
(9)  Duration of Residual Capacity Trips. Once the road facility residual capacity trips are determined, they are valid for one (1) year. 
(10)  Dissolution of Critical Areas of Concurrency (CAOC). If the additional needed road improvements identified in the YIR are added to the CIP or CIE, or funds are available for, and committed for, construction of the needed road improvements to eliminate the classification of a road as a deficient or potentially deficient road segment, then the CAOC established for that deficient or potentially deficient road segment shall be dissolved in the same manner in which it was established.

(1)  Pursuant to article VIII, section 2, Florida Constitution, and Sections 166.021 and 166.041, Florida Statutes, the council has all powers of local self-government to perform city functions and to render city services except when prohibited by law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of city ordinances and resolutions. 
(2)  In addition to its powers of self-government, the council is authorized by Section 170.201, Florida Statutes, to impose residential street lighting assessments in all or a portion of the incorporated area. Additionally, the council derives authority to impose residential street lighting assessments within the municipality from the home rule power of cities in article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution and Section 166.021, Florida Statutes. 
(3)  This chapter authorizes the imposition of residential street lighting assessments throughout the residential street lighting assessment areas. Additionally and alternatively, this chapter authorizes the imposition of a residential street lighting assessment throughout a geographic area designated by the council in an initial assessment resolution or a preliminary rate resolution. 
(4)  The purpose of this chapter is to: 
(i)  Provide procedures and standards for the imposition of annual residential street lighting assessments under the general home rule powers of the city; 
(ii)  Authorize a procedure for the funding of residential street lighting, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city; and 
(iii)  Legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the provision of residential street lighting by the city. 
(5)  Whether imposed throughout the entire city or a portion thereof, the imposition of a recurring annual residential street lighting assessment is an alternative, equitable and efficient method to fairly and reasonably apportion and recover the residential street lighting costs experienced by the city among the parcels of residential property within the area assessed. 
(6)  The use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act provides a mechanism to equitably and efficiently collect residential street lighting assessments, as well as address payment delinquencies and recover unpaid fees, charges, or assessments advanced for residential street lighting to specific parcels of assessed property. 
(7)  The annual residential street lighting assessments to be imposed pursuant to this chapter shall constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(8)  The residential street lighting assessment to be imposed using the procedures provided in this chapter is imposed by the council, not the city clerk, property appraiser, or tax collector. The duties of the city clerk, property appraiser, or tax collector under the provisions of this chapter and the Uniform Assessment Collection Act are ministerial. 
(B)  Legislative determinations of special benefit. It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that the residential street lighting services, facilities, and programs of the city provide a special benefit to property within the city based upon the following legislative determinations: 
    Residential street lighting services, facilities, and programs furnished by the city benefit assessed properties by providing: 
(i)  A deterrent to criminal activity; 
(ii)  Safer roadways for vehicular traffic; 
(iii)  A safer environment for pedestrian traffic; 
(iv)  The protection of property values; and 
(v)  Providing the lowest cost for residential street lighting to residents of assessed property by ensuring that all share in the cost and the assessment is collected in a timely manner. 
(C)  General provisions. 
(1)  Applicability. This chapter and the city's authority to impose assessments pursuant hereto shall be applicable throughout the city. 
(2)  Alternative method. 
(a)  This chapter shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter come into existence. This chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of the city, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. 
(b)  Nothing herein shall preclude the council from directing and authorizing, by resolution, the combination with each other of: 
(c)  (i)  Any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary, or convenient by the city; 
(ii)  Any notice required by this chapter; or 
(iii)  Any notice required by law, including the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 09-64, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Section 161.05. - Annual residential street lighting assessments. 
(A)  General authority. 
(1)  The council is hereby authorized to impose an annual residential street lighting assessment upon assessed property to fund all or any portion of the residential street lighting cost at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs. All residential street lighting assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(2)  The amount of the residential street lighting assessment imposed in a fiscal year against a parcel of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the residential street lighting cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. 
(3)  Any unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for residential street lighting services or facilities which are allocable to specific parcels of assessed property may be included in the annual residential street lighting assessment for such parcels. In such an event, any existing lien on each affected parcel for unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments shall be supplanted by the lien resulting from the inclusion of such unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments in the amount of the residential street lighting assessment. 
(B)  Initial proceedings. 
(1)  The initial proceeding for the imposition of a residential street lighting assessment shall be the adoption of an initial assessment resolution by the council: 
(i)  Containing a brief and general description of the residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs to be provided; 
(ii)  Determining the residential street lighting cost to be assessed; 
(iii)  Describing the method of apportioning the residential street lighting cost and the computation of the residential street lighting assessment for specific properties; 
(iv)  Providing a summary description of the parcels of property (conforming to the description contained on the tax roll) located within the city that receive a special benefit from the provision of residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs or describing any new specific geographic area in which such service, facility, or program will be provided;

b.  Publish the notice required by subsection 161.05(D) hereof; and 
c.  Mail the notice required by subsection 161.05(E) hereof, using information then available from the tax roll.

(iii)  The amount of the residential street lighting assessment to be imposed against each such parcel of assessed property.

The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed form if the amount of the residential street lighting assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a computer terminal available to the public. 
(D)  Notice by publication. Upon completion of the initial assessment roll, the city manager shall publish, or direct the publication of, once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, a notice stating that at a meeting of the council on a certain day and hour, not earlier than twenty (20) calendar days from such publication, which meeting shall be a regular, adjourned, or special meeting, will be held at which the council will hear objections of all interested persons to the final assessment resolution establishing the rate of assessment and approving the aforementioned initial assessment roll. The published notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such notice shall include: 
(1)  A geographic depiction of the property subject to the residential street lighting assessment; 
(2)  A brief and general description of the residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs to be provided;

(E)  Notice by mail. In addition to the published notice required by subsection 161.05(D), the city manager shall provide notice, or direct the provision of notice, of the proposed residential street lighting assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the residential street lighting assessment. Such notice shall include:

(4)  The number of such units contained in each parcel of property; 
(5)  The total revenue to be collected by the city from the residential street lighting assessment; 
(6)  A statement that failure to pay the residential street lighting assessment will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the property or foreclosure proceedings to be instituted, either of which may result in a loss of title to the property; 
(7)  Notification that unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for residential street lighting services allocable to specific parcels will be additionally included in the residential street lighting assessment; 
(8)  A statement that all affected owners have a right to appear at the hearing and to file written objections with the council within twenty (20) days of the notice; and 
(9)  The date, time, and place of the hearing. 
    The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Notice shall be mailed at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the hearing to each owner at such address as is shown on the tax roll. Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the United States Postal Service. The city manager may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the owner to receive such notice, due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll or release or discharge any obligation for payment of a residential street lighting assessment imposed by the council pursuant to this chapter. 
(F)  Adoption of final assessment resolution. At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the council, the council shall receive any written objections of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the council adopt the final assessment resolution which shall:

(2)  Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; 
(3)  Approve the inclusion of any unpaid or delinquent fees, charges, or assessments due the city for street lighting; 
(4)  Approve the initial assessment roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and 
(5)  Determine the method of collection. 
    The adoption of the final assessment resolution by the council shall constitute a legislative determination that all parcels assessed derive a special benefit from the residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs to be provided and a legislative determination that the residential street lighting assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the special benefit. All objections to the final assessment resolution shall be made in writing, and filed with the city manager at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall constitute the annual rate resolution for the initial fiscal year in which residential street lighting assessments are imposed or re-imposed hereunder. 
(G)  Effect of final assessment resolution. The residential street lighting assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the initial rate of assessment, the initial assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the residential street lighting assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the council action on the final assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in subsection 161.06(B) hereof is used to collect the residential street lighting assessments, such other official as the council by resolution shall designate. 
(H)  Adoption of annual rate resolution. 
(1)  The council shall adopt an annual rate resolution each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which a residential street lighting assessment is imposed hereunder. 
(2)  The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate resolution by the council: 
(i)  Containing a brief and general description of the residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs to be provided; 
(ii)  Determining the residential street lighting cost to be assessed for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(iii)  Establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year; 
(iv)  Authorizing the date, time, and place of a public hearing to receive and consider comments from the public and consider the adoption of the annual rate resolution for the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(v)  Directing the city manager to: 
a.  Update the assessment roll; 
b.  Provide notice by publication and first class mail to affected owners in the event circumstances described in subsection (6) of this subsection so require; and 
c.  Direct and authorize any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the city. 
(3)  The annual rate resolution shall: 
(i)  Establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year; and 
(ii)  Approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the council deems just and right. 
The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent preliminary rate resolution, together with modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall preclude the council from providing annual notification to all owners of assessed property in the manner provided in either or both subsections 161.05(D) or 161.05(E) hereof. 
(5)  Nothing herein shall preclude the council from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to subsections 161.05(D) and 161.05(E) hereof. 
(6)  In the event: 
(i)  The proposed residential street lighting assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the council and included in the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 161.05(D) and 161.05(E) hereof; 
(ii)  The purpose for which the residential street lighting assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the residential street lighting assessment is substantially changed from that represented by the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 161.05(D) and 161.05(E) hereof; 
(iii)  Assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased residential street lighting assessment from that represented by the notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to subsections 161.05(D) and 161.05(E) hereof; or 
(iv)  An assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year. 
Notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed property. Such notice shall substantially conform to the notice requirements set forth in subsections 161.05(D) and 161.05(E) hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice, due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll or release or discharge any obligation for payment of a residential street lighting assessment imposed by the council pursuant to this chapter. 
(7)  As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the final assessment resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the residential street lighting assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the council action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality of any prior fee, charge, or assessment imposed by the city or any residential street lighting assessment not challenged within the required 20-day period for those residential street lighting assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution. 
(8)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in subsection 161.06(B) hereof is used to collect the residential street lighting assessments, such other official as the council by resolution shall designate. If the residential street lighting assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by any court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll. 
(I)  Lien of residential street lighting assessments. Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all residential street lighting assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims until paid. The lien for a residential street lighting assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the council of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a residential street lighting assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Method shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a residential street lighting assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in subsection 161.06(B) shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the council of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(J)  Revisions to residential street lighting assessments. If any residential street lighting assessment made under the provisions of this chapter is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the council is satisfied that any such residential street lighting assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the council has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the council may take all necessary steps to impose a new residential street lighting assessment against any property benefited by the residential street lighting costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this chapter and in case such second residential street lighting assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the council may obtain and impose other residential street lighting assessments until a valid residential street lighting assessment is imposed. 
(K)  Procedural irregularities. Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any residential street lighting assessment under the provisions of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any residential street lighting assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such residential street lighting assessment was duly levied, that the residential street lighting assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such residential street lighting assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this Chapter; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any party objecting to a residential street lighting assessment imposed pursuant to this chapter must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(L)  Correction of errors and omissions. 
(1)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, council, or their deputies, employees, or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a residential street lighting assessment imposed by the council under the provision of this chapter. 
(2)  When it shall appear that any residential street lighting assessment should have been imposed under this chapter against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of residential street lighting services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the council may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted parcel in the manner and form provided in subsection 161.05(E), impose the applicable residential street lighting assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable residential street lighting assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such residential street lighting assessment shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in section 161.06 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(3)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a residential street lighting assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the residential street lighting assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the residential street lighting assessment imposed under the provisions of this chapter. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(4)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 09-64, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 161.06. - Collection and use of residential street lighting assessments. 
(A)  Method of collection. 
(1)  Unless otherwise directed by the council, the residential street lighting assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this chapter may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(2)  The amount of a residential street lighting assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefited property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(i)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(ii)  Notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and 
(iii)  Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such residential street lighting assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(B)  Alternative method of collection. In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city may elect to collect the residential street lighting assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this subsection: 
(1)  The city shall provide residential street lighting assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(i)  A brief explanation of the residential street lighting assessment; 
(ii)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the residential street lighting assessment; 
(iii)  The number of units contained within the parcel; 
(iv)  The total amount of the residential street lighting assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period; 
(v)  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
(vi)  The date on which the residential street lighting assessment is due; and 
(vii)  A statement that the residential street lighting assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the residential street lighting assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent residential street lighting assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A residential street lighting assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date any installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her residential street lighting assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will either: 
(i)  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent residential street lighting assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
(ii)  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent residential street lighting assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city or its agent may join in one (1) foreclosure action the collection of residential street lighting assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, in collection of such delinquent residential street lighting assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent residential street lighting assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent residential street lighting assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
(i)  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this chapter; and 
(ii)  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent residential street lighting assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the city's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or her or other city officials in subsection 161.05(L) hereof. 
(7)  Any council action required in the collection of residential street lighting assessments may be by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 09-64, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 161.07. - Installation and maintenance. 
    Florida Power & Light Company, who shall install and be responsible for the actual maintenance of the street lighting, shall protect and save the city harmless from any and all damage and loss arising from, out of, or by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the residential street lighting. Florida Power & Light Company will have the authority to determine the final placement of the lights. 
(Ord. No. 09-64, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 161.08. - Creation of additional residential street lighting assessment areas. 
(A)  Before residential street lighting services are extended to a new assessment area, the council shall, not later than June 1, hold a public hearing after publishing notice of such hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, one time, not more than ten (10) days before the date set for such hearing and after sending a copy of said notice by regular mail to the record title holders as shown in the latest records of the county property appraiser of all property to be assessed, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing. Said notice shall, in general, describe the street lighting to be undertaken, its location, the estimated cost thereof, and a description of the properties specially benefited against which the assessment is to be levied. The estimates of costs and assessments may be based upon the costs and assessments of previous years. 
(B)  Provided, however, that no new residential street lighting assessment area shall be considered, except in an emergency, until all of the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  (a)  A property owner, of any lot, parcel, or tract of land within the city not served by street lighting shall obtain a street lighting request form from the City Clerk in order to designate a new area for residential street lighting, which area shall include the applicant's lot, parcel or tract. The size of the new area shall be determined by the city clerk by considering economy of operation among other considerations. 
(b)  Submittal of a petition to the city clerk to designate a new area for residential street lighting. The petition must contain signatures of at least twenty-five (25) percent of the property owners of any lots, parcels or tracts of land on a contiguous residential roadway within the city not served by street lighting. When more than one person holds an interest in any lot, parcel, or tract, only one signature may be counted towards the twenty-five (25) percent threshold. The proposed new area for residential street lighting designated in the petition must include the lots, parcels, or tracts owned by the signatories to the petition. 
Upon verification that the twenty-five (25) percent threshold has been met under 161.08(B)(1)(b), the size of the new area requested shall be finalized by the city clerk by considering economy of operation among other considerations. 
(2)  Upon the twenty-five (25) percent threshold being met under 161.08(B)(1)(a), an election regarding street lighting shall be conducted by the city clerk. The city clerk shall forward a ballot by U.S. mail, to the mailing address set forth in the St. Lucie County Property Appraiser's records for each lot, parcel, or tract, located within the proposed new street lighting area. The city clerk shall forward the ballots with a return date of not less than thirty (30) days but not more than sixty (60) days following the date of the mailing. Voting is on a per lot, parcel, or tract basis with one vote per lot, parcel, or tract. When more than one person holds an interest in any lot, parcel, or tract the vote for such lot, parcel, or tract shall be exercised as such persons determine, but in no event shall more than one vote be cast with respect to any lot, parcel, or tract. 
(3)  An affirmative vote of fifty (50) percent plus one (1) of the eligible votes cast for the establishment of the assessment area shall cause its creation. Assessments and operations of the new assessment area shall proceed as provided herein. 
(C)  All mailed notices or ballots provided herein shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the United States Postal Service. Failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistaken or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of these proceedings.
