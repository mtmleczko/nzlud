PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 1389, adopted June 3, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 1981 Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
STATUTORY REFERENCE TABLE 	SRT:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

(5)  Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships and corporations as well as to males. 
(6)  Health officer or city health officer. Wherever the words "health officer" or "city health officer" appear in this Code, they shall be construed to mean the county health officer of Brevard County, since such health officer is ex officio city health officer. 
(7)  Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three (3) or more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers. 
(8)  Keeper and proprietor. The words "keeper" and "proprietor" shall mean and include persons, firms, associations, corporations, clubs and copartnerships, whether acting by themselves or a servant, agent or employee.

(11)  Oath. The word "oath" shall be construed to include an affirmation in all cases in which, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in such cases the words "swear" and "sworn" shall be equivalent to the words "affirm" and "affirmed". 
(12)  Or, and. "Or" may be read "and," and "and" may be read "or" if the sense requires it.

(19)  Real property shall include lands, tenements and hereditaments. 
(20)  Sidewalk. The word "sidewalk" shall mean any portion of a street between the curb line and the adjacent property line, intended for the use of pedestrians, excluding parkways. 
(21)  Signature or subscription includes a mark when the person cannot write. 
(22)  State shall be construed to mean the State of Florida. 
(23)  Street shall be construed to embrace streets, avenues, boulevards, roads, alleys, lanes, viaducts and all other public highways in the city. 
(24)  Shall. The word shall when used in any provision of this Code, as distinguished from the word "may", denotes a mandatory intent. 
(25)  Tenant. The words "tenant" or "occupant", applied to a building or land, shall include any person holding a written or oral lease of, or who occupies the whole or a part of such building or land, either alone or with others. 
(26)  Time. Words used in the past or present tense include the future as well as the past and present. 
(27)  Written or in writing shall be construed to include any representation of words, letters or figures, whether by printing, duplicating, handwriting, or otherwise.

State Law reference— "Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, of default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be counted, unless it is a Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the period shall run until the end of a next day which is neither a Sunday nor a legal holiday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed shall be less than 7 days, intermediate Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. A half holiday shall be considered as any other day and not as a holiday," 1954 Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, § 1.6.  
Sec. 1-3. - Catchlines of sections. 
The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in bold face caps and lower case are intended as mere catch words to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or re-enacted.  
Sec. 1-4. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed under the ordinance repealed.  
Sec. 1-5. - Severability of parts of Code. 
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city commission that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code.  
Sec. 1-6. - Amendments to Code; effect of new ordinances; amendatory language. 
All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are re-adopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the city commission. 
Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in substantially the following language: "Be It Ordained by the Commission of the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida: That section _____ of the Code of the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida, is hereby amended to read as follows: …." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as desired. 
In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code, is to be added, the following language shall be used: "Be It Ordained by the Commission of the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida: That the Code of Ordinances, City of Cocoa Beach, Florida, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered _____, which said section reads as follows: …." The new section shall then be set out in full as desired. 
All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed must be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
Cross reference— For explanation of numbering system for adding new section, see Preface.

Any person, firm or corporation violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 hereof. 
State Law reference— Forgery, F.S. § 831.01; falsifying public records, F.S. § 839.13.  
Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; continuing violations; adjudging fines and imprisonments. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any provisions of this Code and regardless of any provision of law to the contrary the violation of any provision of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code shall continue, shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Whenever the sentence shall be one of both fine and imprisonment, it may also provide for an additional period of imprisonment in the city jail for which such person shall be held in default of payment of fine and costs. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall exempt a prisoner from being put at labor during the period of such additional imprisonment.

Sec. 2-1. - Meetings of the city commission. 
Regular meetings of the commission of the City of Cocoa Beach shall be held on the first and third Thursdays of each month commencing at a time to be designated annually by the city commission during the first commission meeting held each December. Any matter submitted by a member of the public which should legally and properly be placed upon the agenda of a regular official city commission meeting shall be submitted in writing at such time as to be received by the city manager no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Tuesday of the week preceding the regular Thursday commission meeting. Said written communication shall state the date the matter is to be discussed by the commission, the nature of the matter, commission action requested, the name of the petitioner and name, address and telephone number of the spokesperson, if any, who will appear for the petitioner at said commission meeting. Any such matter which in the opinion of the city attorney would be prejudicial to the best interest of the city if placed on the agenda, shall not be so placed, and shall instead be returned to the petitioner, together with the city attorney's opinion as to the reason for rejection. If in the opinion of the city manager an item is an administrative issue that can best be handled by city staff, the petitioner will be so advised by the city manager.

Sec. 2-2. - Employment of relatives of city commission and commission compensation. 
(a)  [Nepotism.] The City of Cocoa Beach shall not employ any person who is related to a city commissioner as spouse, child, brother, or sister of such commissioner. 
(b)  The salary of the members of the city commission shall be established at five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the mayor and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the commissioners. 
(c)  [Charter regulations.] Pursuant to section 2.11, Cocoa Beach Charter, the salary of the members of the City Commissioner [Commission] shall be set, and may be altered from time to time, by ordinance. As set forth in the Charter, the City Commission may provide, from time to time, for the salary limits in this section to be increased by a factor not exceeding the cost of living. No increase in commission salary will be automatic. Increases must be adopted by ordinance. 
(d)  Cost-of-living related definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall be defined as set forth below: 
(1)  "Adjustment date" is defined as a consecutive twelve-month period with the first adjustment date being January 7, 2000. 
(2)  "Cost of living" shall be determined by reference to a pre-established cost of employment index entitled as the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") utilized for calculating the increase in the cost of goods and services as the "CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, ALL URBAN CONSUMERS (CPI-U), U.S. City Average, (1982-1984=100)," or the same index having the most current base index, which index is not seasonally adjusted. The CPI is prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. In the event the U.S. Department of Labor ceases to prepare and to publish such index, series, or index numbers, the adjustment of salaries thereafter shall be according to the most closely comparable index published by the U.S. Department of Labor; and if such is not determined by that department, then the most closely comparable commodity index, all as determined by majority vote of the city commission. 
(3)  "Index" shall refer to the actual cost of living increase reported by month and year. In performing calculations to determine the CPI increase over a particular period of time, reference shall be made to the cost of living for a particular month and year by examining the CPI for the most recent reported month preceding the calendar month in which the adjustment is to be adopted. 
(e)  Computation of cost of living increase. A cost of living increase shall be computed as follows: Beginning with the first adjustment date occurring during the second calendar year after adoption of the current salary as set forth in this ordinance and for each adjustment date thereafter, the commission's salary may at the discretion of the commission be adjusted. The cost of living increase is expressed as a fraction, the numerator of which is the index reported for the most recent reported month and year reported prior to the current adjustment date and the denominator of which is the index reported for the same month and year of the most previous adjustment date. In no event shall the cost of living increase in city commission salaries exceed the average percentage salary increase awarded to general employees of the city over a similar period. 
By way of example, the first adjustment date for commission salary shall occur on January 7, 2000, as the last increase occurred or current salary was adopted on January 7, 1999. If at the discretion of the commission, a cost of living increase was proposed for January 7, 2000, the existing salary would be multiplied times a fraction in which the numerator is the index reported for the most recent month and year prior to January 2000, and the denominator of which is the index reported for the same month and year prior to January 1999. Any subsequent cost of living increases shall be based on a consecutive twelve-month period. If the salary is not increased for the cost of living increase in any one-adjustment period, the commission shall not add the foregoing cost of living increase to a later adjustment date.

(Ord. No. 825, § 1, 6-5-1986; Ord. No. 1204, § 3, 9-2-1999)  
Sec. 2.5-4. - Findings of facts.

(Tampa, Florida) relating to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; the "Report to: The American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses," Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. (1996); and the findings of fact relating to the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, and Seminole County, Florida, two neighboring counties in Central Florida, other matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this Ordinance and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; the council finds: 
(a)  Establishments exist or may exist within the City of Cocoa Beach and other nearby cities and counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals, pamphlets, newspapers, comic books, story papers, written or printed stories or articles, writing paper, cards, novelties, pictures, drawings, photographs, motion picture films, figures, images, phonograph records, wires, tapes or other recordings, or any written, printed or recorded matter of any such character which may or may not require mechanical or other means to be transmitted into auditory, visual or sensory representations of such character, and/or any devices which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(b)  Establishments exist or may exist within the City of Cocoa Beach and other nearby cities and counties in Central Florida: 
(1)  Where the superficial tissues of one (1) person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, and/or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified anatomical areas; 
(2)  Where dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals who, for any form of commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing any specified anatomical area; or 
(3)  Where straddle dancing occurs. 
(c)  The activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur at commercial establishments and as such, are subject to regulation by the City of Cocoa Beach in the interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Cocoa Beach. 
(d)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are present in establishments within the City of Cocoa Beach and other communities, other activities which are illegal, immoral or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(e)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are present in establishments within the City of Cocoa Beach and other communities, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote crime, particularly the kinds detailed in subsection (d) above, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(f)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur are usually constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, and are usually maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants. 
(g)  The activities described in subsections (a) and (b) frequently occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(h)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) leads to an increase in criminal activity, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and order of the City of Cocoa Beach and other communities. 
(i)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance, depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harms the economic welfare of the City of Cocoa Beach, harms family oriented tourism within the City of Cocoa Beach and adversely affects the public's interest in the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment in the City of Cocoa Beach and other communities. 
(j)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Cocoa Beach, it is necessary and advisable for the City of Cocoa Beach to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur. 
(k)  Workers of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur, engage in a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior than workers of other establishments. 
(l)  Physical contact within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(m)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Cocoa Beach, it is necessary and advisable for the City of Cocoa Beach to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, workers, agents, employees, entertainers, performers and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur. 
(n)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Cocoa Beach posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur to operate without first obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(o)  Requiring licensees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur to maintain information concerning current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, protects minors, assure correct identification of workers, deploy law enforcement personnel effectively, and notify workers of conduct that is permitted and prohibited under this chapter. 
(p)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the establishment is operated in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of Cocoa Beach. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(q)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, areas zoned for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(r)  "Straddle dancing" is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(s)  The activities described above often occur between the establishment workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and the establishment's customers. As a result, often these workers pose a threat to the health of both themselves and customers and promote the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(t)  When the activities described above are present in establishments, they tend to adversely affect property values, encourage illegal, immoral, or unhealthy behavior, and threatens the present and future character of neighborhoods. 
(u)  Workers at adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented businesses engage in a higher incident of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers in other establishments including a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796, operation without occupational licenses, and illegal unlicensed massage. 
(v)  The practice of not paying, or paying low wages to, workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire, or most of their, income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in an extremely high, nearly universal, incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(w)  Sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare and safety of the community. 
(x)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(y)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lead themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(z)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(aa)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(bb)  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(cc)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(dd)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain, those facilities. 
(ee)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(ff)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(gg)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(hh)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, to protect minors, to assure correct identification of persons working in establishments, to enable the effective deployment of law enforcement personnel, to notify workers of conduct that is permitted and prohibited under this chapter, and to detect and discourage the involvement of organized crime in the adult entertainment and sexually oriented business industry, to have available for inspection from operators of establishments a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
The findings made herein raise important, substantial, and compelling governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics, which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those governmental concerns.

--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1323, § 2, adopted Dec. 6, 2001, in part, changed the title of Art. VII of this chapter from "Procedure for Removal of Unsafe and Dangerous Buildings" to "Procedure for Abatement of Unsafe and Dangerous Buildings." 
 
Sec. 6-38. - Unsafe buildings declared public nuisance. 
All buildings or structures within the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida, which are unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or which are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to their existing use constitute a hazard to the safety or health of occupants of the general public by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are hereby found to be unsafe buildings or structures under the provisions of this article and are hereby declared to be public nuisances. For the purpose of making the determination that any building or structure is an unsafe building as defined herein, the standards and requirements of the adopted city building code(s), including all additions and amendments and all other codes, statutes, ordinances and laws regulating the construction of structures within the City of Cocoa Beach, shall be considered as standards. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972; Ord. No. 1323, § 2, 12-6-2001)  
Sec. 6-39. - Nuisance survey and report. 
The building official of the City of Cocoa Beach shall make a finding when any building or structure constitutes a nuisance as an unsafe building or structure, and shall notice the city commission of said finding of nuisance. Said notice shall contain the factors or evidence relied upon in the certified findings that the building or structure is a nuisance as an unsafe building or structure, shall specify what portion or portions of such building or structure constitutes a nuisance, and shall contain a description of the building or structure certified as a nuisance together with, to the extent practicable, the description by metes and bounds or by lot number of the property upon which such building or structure is located. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972; Ord. No. 1323, § 2, 12-6-2001)  
Sec. 6-40. - Process for the abatement of unsafe and dangerous buildings. 
The process for the abatement of unsafe and dangerous buildings shall be as provided and in accordance with the Standard Unsafe Building Abatement Code, latest edition, which is hereby adopted. 
For buildings and/or structures which have been determined by the building official to require removal or demolition in order to abate the nuisance, the following procedures shall be followed: 
(a)  The city commission shall consider such certified finding of a public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure that requires removal or demolition at any regularly scheduled meeting and shall be authorized to receive and consider such additional supporting data as it, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary to determine the prima facie existence of a public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure that requires removal or demolition. If the commission shall determine that the prima facie existence of a public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure that requires removal or demolition is established, a written notice of such determination shall be filed with the city clerk. Said notice shall contain: 
(1)  A description of the land, building, structure or premises constituting said public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure, said description to include, to the extent practicable, a description by metes and bounds or by lot number as indicated in the public records of Brevard County, Florida. 
(2)  The name or names of the occupants of the property, if known, and the names, places of residence, legal disabilities, if any and if known, and interest of the owners of such property, if known. This requirement shall be satisfied if a diligent and reasonable search of the property and the public records of Brevard County, Florida, is made. If the name of the owner and occupant is not known then such fact shall be so stated. 
(3)  The condition found to exist that constitutes the prima facie finding of public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure that requires removal or demolition. 
(4)  The corrective action required to be done to abate the specified public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure including, but not limited to, the destruction of such building or structure 
(b)  A copy of said notice shall be served upon the occupant and owner of such land, building, structure or premises, if known, together with a summons to appear before the city commission at a public hearing at least ten (10) days subsequent to the date of service of said summons, and show cause, if any, why such land, building, structure or premises should not be declared a public nuisance and the corrective action of abatement specified in said notice should not be taken; or cause, if any, why the cost of the corrective action of abatement specified in said notice should not be paid for by the owner of such land, building, structure or premises; or cause, if any, why said cost should not be assessed against said land or premises. Said notice and summons shall be served in the manner specified in section 6-45 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972; Ord. No. 1323, § 2, 12-6-2001)  
Sec. 6-41. - Public hearing on nuisance abatement requiring demolition or removal. 
(a)  At the time fixed for said public hearing, the owner or occupant of such land, building, structure or premises or any interested person shall have the right to present any relevant or material facts or evidence as to why such land, building, structure or premises does not create a public nuisance as an unsafe building or structure that requires removal or demolition or why the cost of the abatement of said nuisance should not be paid for by the owner of said land, building, structure or premises or why the cost of the abatement of said nuisance should not be assessed against such land or premises. 
(b)  If, after said hearing, the commission determines that the condition exists as set forth in the certified finding of public nuisance and the prima facie determination of public nuisance, the commission shall issue an order by resolution declaring the nature of the public nuisance, describing the land, building, structure or premises upon which such public nuisance exists, naming the owner and occupant of such land and premises, if known, describing the corrective action required to abate such public nuisance and setting a date certain by which such corrective action shall be completed. Notice of such determination shall be forthwith sent to the owner or occupant of such land, building, structure or premises, if known. 
(c)  If, after said hearing, the commission determines that the condition set forth in the certified finding of public nuisance and the prima facie determination of public nuisance do not require removal or demolition, then no action shall be taken by the city to remove or demolish the subject building(s) and/or structure(s). Notice of such determination shall be forthwith sent to the owner or occupant of such land, building, structure or premises, if known. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972; Ord. No. 1323, § 2, 12-6-2001)  
Sec. 6-42. - Failure to abate nuisance. 
(a)  In the event the corrective action required to abate such public nuisance is not completed by the date set forth in the order by resolution adopted in accordance with section 6-41(b) of this article, the city shall take the necessary corrective action to abate such public nuisance and the employees or agents of the city shall have the right to go upon the land or premises upon which such public nuisance exists to perform such action. The costs of said corrective action of abatement, including the cost incurred in the administration of the public nuisance certification, in the searching of the public records to determine the record owners and in serving the notice as specified in section 6-45 of this article, shall be taxed to the owner or owners of the affected land or premises and shall become a lien against such land or premises as provided in section 6-43 of this article. 
(b)  The director of the department of public works or such other authorized party as determined by the city manager shall certify such costs that are incurred in abating the public nuisance as specified in this section. A copy of such certification shall be sent by certified mail to the owner at his last known address, if known, which copy shall constitute a demand for the payment of such cost by the owner within thirty (30) days from the date of such mailing. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972; Ord. No. 1323, § 2, 12-6-2001)  
Sec. 6-43. - Nonpayment of costs constitutes lien against property. 
If the owner fails to make payment within said thirty (30) days, the amount of the certified cost shall be assessed by the commission against the affected land and such assessment shall create and be a lien against such land, subject only to the lien for taxes due the County of Brevard and State of Florida and City of Cocoa Beach. Said assessment shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum and shall constitute a lien upon the land from the date of the assessment and shall be collectible in the same manner as liens for taxes and with the same attorney's fee, interest and penalties for default in payment, and under the same provisions as to sale and forfeiture, as apply to other city taxes. Collection of such assessments, with such interest and with a reasonable attorney's fee, may also be made by the city commission by proceedings in a court of equity to foreclose the lien of the assessment in the manner in which a lien for mortgages is foreclosed under the laws of Florida and it shall be lawful to join in any complaint for foreclosure any one (1) or more lots or parcels of land, by whomever owned, if assessed under the provisions of this article. The property subject to lien may be redeemed at any time prior to sale by the owner by paying the total amount due under said lien including interest, court costs, advertising costs and reasonable attorney's fees. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972)  
Sec. 6-44. - Right to hearing on assessment. 
Prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) days provided in section 6-43 of this article, any owner shall have the right to have a hearing before the commission to show cause, if any, why the cost and charges incurred by the city under this article are excessive or unwarranted or why such costs should not constitute a lien against said land, provided that nothing contained in this section is to be construed to disturb or permit a review of the order by resolution by the city commission of the existence of the public nuisance under section 6-41 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 394, § 1, 4-27-1972)  
Sec. 6-45. - Service of notice. 
All service of notice to implement provisions of this article shall as be required by the Standard Unsafe Building Abatement Code, latest edition, and as set forth as follows: 
(a)  Notices shall be provided to the owner or occupant by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested, provided if such notice is sent under this article to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the local government by such owner and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in subsection 6-45(b)(2) of this article, and by first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the local government with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing;

The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under Chapter 50, Florida Statutes for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in Sections 50.041 and 50.051, Florida Statutes. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described above, such notice may be posted at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property that is subject to abatement and at the Cocoa Beach City Hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection 6-45(a) of this article. 
Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection 6-45(a) of this article together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection 6-45(b) of this article, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this article have been met, without regard to whether or not the owner(s) and/or occupant(s) actually received such notice.

Sec. 8-12. - Purpose and intent; findings; jurisdiction; statutory authority. 
The purpose of this article is to regulate, within the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida, those games, machines or devices which are unlawful under Chapter 849, Florida Statutes, because the machines are slot machines or devices as defined herein and in Chapter 849, Florida Statutes. The city commission finds that evidence has been propounded indicating that slot machines or devices can lead to gambling addictions, along with the secondary consequences that such addictions impose upon the community, including increases in crime, debt, suicide and other negative effects on the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents and visitors to the areas where these devices exist. By law, local governments have all powers of self-government which do not conflict with Florida laws, including those police powers sufficient to eliminate public nuisances and regulate activities which would otherwise cause harm to the public. Pursuant to Section 1.01 of the City Charter, the city commission hereby intends to regulate slot machines or devices to accomplish the purposes set-forth above.

This definition is not intended to and specifically does not include merchandise vending machines, coin-operated mechanical or electrical musical instruments or devices, or coin-operated amusement devices which are not in the nature of, or similar to, casino-type slot machines.

If the special magistrate/code enforcement board does not agree to abate or reduce the lien their decision shall be final. If the special magistrate/code enforcement board finds cause for abatement or reduction of the charges, the special magistrate/code enforcement board shall make this recommendation to the city commission. The city commission, as soon as practical, shall decide if the charges should be abated or reduced. The decision of the city commission shall be final.

The disability benefit shall be the participant's accrued retirement benefit at the time of disability reduced by two and one-half (2½) per cent per year for the number of years that the first disability payment precedes the normal retirement age commencing on the date of disability and continuing until the participant's normal retirement age, at which time the reduction factor shall be eliminated and the participant shall receive their accrued benefit as of the day before their disability began. 
(c)  Determination of disability. 
(1)  Initial determination. The board may consider reports of physicians, and Social Security, Worker's Compensation and Veterans Administration disability determinations in determining whether a participant is disabled; however, such reports and determinations shall not be binding upon the board. The board may also require the participant to be examined, at the plan's expense, by physicians and other medical, vocational and rehabilitation professionals selected by the board whose reports may be considered by, but shall not be binding upon, the board in determining disability. The board should determine eligibility for disability benefits within sixty (60) days after all required documentation and reports have been submitted to the board. 
(2)  Continuing review. The board may review the status of each disability benefit recipient periodically and may, in its sole discretion, require recipients, as a condition of continued payment of disability benefits, to submit physician's reports or submit to examinations, at the plan's expense, by physicians or other medical, vocational or rehabilitation professionals. Failure to submit to the required examinations shall be grounds to withhold benefit payments until such time as the requirements are met. 
(d)  Recovery from disability. 
(1)  Recovery. If a disability benefit recipient recovers and is no longer eligible for a disability benefit, the participant's disability benefit shall be discontinued. 
(2)  Credit during disability. A recipient of a disability benefit who has recovered and returned to work shall not receive full vesting credit for all time during which the participant received a disability benefit but shall not suffer a break in service for the period of their disability.

Distributions under this plan will be made in accordance with regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (9). Provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (9) shall override any distribution options in the plan that may be inconsistent with such section.

Sec. 16-95. - Benefit level. 
(a)  Calculation of benefit amount.

b.  three (3) per cent of average final compensation, for employees whose most recent date of hire was before the effective date of this article, 
both subject to maximum benefits of eighty (80) per cent of average final compensation for employees who had less than twenty-five (25) vesting credits as of December 31, 1998 and ninety (90) per cent of average final compensation for employees who had twenty-five (25) or more vesting credits as of December 31, 1998. 
(2)  A participant retiring after their normal retirement age shall receive the greater of: 
a.  Their accrued benefit on their late retirement date; or 
b.  Their accrued benefit on the date of their normal retirement age, multiplied by the factor shown below corresponding to the number of years their late retirement date follows his normal retirement age: 
Number of Years Late Retirement Date

7 	1.5000 
8 	1.5900 
9 	1.6900 
10 	1.7900

(1)  Whenever any person entitled to payments under this pension plan shall be a minor, under a legal disability, or, in the sole judgment of the trustees, be otherwise unable to care for their affairs in their own best interest and advantage (whether because of illness, accident, incapacity or other mental or physical condition), the trustees may direct that all or any portion of such payments be made in any of the following ways (unless a claim has been made by a legal guardian, tutor, conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal representative, in which event payment shall be made to such representative): 
a.  to the spouse, child, parent, or other blood relative, to be expended on behalf of the person (or on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person has the duty to support); or

In order to file an appeal, a written notice of appeal must be submitted within sixty (60) days after the notice of denial, suspension or termination is received by the claimant (or such later time as the trustees deem reasonable).

In no case, however, shall any action be brought unless instituted within one (1) year from the time the claimant received the notice of denial, suspension, or termination provided in section 16-112(c) (denial of benefits). 
(Ord. No. 1222, § 1, 11-18-1999)  
Sec. 16-113. - Funding. 
(a)  Funding. The plan shall be funded by contributions from Participants, contributions from the City of Cocoa Beach and other income sources as authorized by law. 
(b)  Participant contributions. All participants shall make regular contributions at the rate of five (5) per cent of earnings which shall be deposited in the fund at least monthly. The City of Cocoa Beach shall assume and pay participant contributions in lieu of payroll deductions from participants' earnings no participant shall have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the city directly to the plan. All such contributions by the city shall be deemed and considered as a part of the participant's accumulated contributions and subject to all provisions of this plan pertaining to accumulated contributions of members. This city "pick-up" of contributions is the result of a five (5) per cent reduction of each participant's base pay and of base pay levels which occurred on October 1, 1999 and is intended to comply with Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
If a participant has not made contributions for any period of covered service, the participant must pay retroactive contributions for that period in order to receive vesting credit for that period. Such retroactive contributions shall be made over a period of time equal to the period of time for which contributions were not made unless the participant selects a shorter period. All retroactive contributions due must be paid in full prior to retirement. 
(c)  City contributions. The City of Cocoa Beach shall contribute to the plan on at least a quarterly basis an amount which, together with the contributions derived from participants and the amount derived from premium taxes and other income sources as authorized by law, will be sufficient to meet the normal cost of the plan and to fund the actuarial deficiency over a period of not more than thirty (30) years. 
(d)  Basis of payments from the pension plan. All benefits and expenses shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this pension plan and the trust agreement and consistent with Florida Statutes and the Internal Revenue Code. 
(Ord. No. 1222, § 1, 11-18-1999)  
Sec. 16-114. - Miscellaneous.

(b)  Standards of proof. The board of trustees shall be the sole judge of the standards of proof required in any case. In the application and interpretation of this pension plan, the decisions of the trustees shall be final and binding on the participants and beneficiaries, the city and all other persons. 
(c)  Benefits not assignable. 
(1)  The right of any person to any payment under this pension plan shall not be subject to assignment, alienation or voluntary or involuntary transfer, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be subject to attachment, execution, garnishment, sequestration or other legal or equitable process. In the event any person attempts to assign, transfer or dispose of such right, or if an attempt is made to subject said right to such process, such assignment, transfer or disposition shall be null and void. 
(d)  Forfeitures. Forfeitures and dividends shall not be used to increase the benefits that any participant would otherwise receive under the pension plan at any time prior to the termination of the pension plan or the complete discontinuance of contributions to the pension plan, but shall be anticipated in determining the costs under the pension plan. 
(e)  Merger. This pension plan shall not merge or consolidate with any other pension plan, nor transfer any assets or liabilities to any other pension plan, unless each participant in this pension plan will receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation or transfer (if the pension plan then terminated) which is at least equal to the benefit the participant was entitled to immediately before such merger, consolidation or transfer (if the pension plan had terminated). 
(f)  Termination of pension plan. In the event of termination of the pension plan, the trustees shall follow the procedures contained in Florida Statutes, the Internal Revenue Code, and all other applicable laws. 
(g)  Incorporation by reference. This pension plan is maintained for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries, and is intended to satisfy all the requirements of Florida Statutes and the Internal Revenue Code. In the event any requirements of such laws have been omitted, they shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference. 
(h)  Amendment of pension plan. This pension plan may be amended at any time by the Cocoa Beach City Commission prospectively or retroactively, provided that such amendment complies with the Internal Revenue Code, Florida Statues, all other applicable laws, and the purposes as set forth in the ordinance and declaration of trust. Additionally, and not by way of limitation, the city commission, upon the recommendation of the board of trustees, may amend this pension plan when it is deemed necessary to maintain its tax exempt status, or to preserve compliance with the Internal Revenue Code, Florida Statutes, and all other applicable laws. However, no amendment which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect. 
(Ord. No. 1222, § 1, 11-18-1999; Ord. No. 1628, § 10, 12-6-2018)  
Sec. 16-115. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income. 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a participant at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the participant multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one (1), the numerator of which is the participant's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one (1) year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is ten (10). For this purpose, no more than one (1) year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  Annual pension means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
1.  The straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the participant's form of benefit, or 
2.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five (5) per cent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
b.  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
1.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
2.  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five (5) per cent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to IRC § 417(e)(3) and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to IRC § 415(d). For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  Dollar limitation means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), automatically adjusted under IRC § 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a participant's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the participant when the benefit begins as follows: 
a.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
1.  If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age sixty-five (65): 
i.  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement: 
The dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five (5) per cent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
ii.  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement: 
The dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.1.i. of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the participant. 
2.  Except with respect to a participant who is a "qualified member" as defined in IRC § 415(b)(2)(H), for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in IRC § 415(b)(2)(I)), if the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is before age sixty-two (62): 
i.  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement: 
The dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five (5) per cent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
ii.  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement: 
The dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.2.i. of this subsection (a). 
b.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: 	Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: 
Over 65 	The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or 
	(b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
	Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 
62 to 65 	No adjustment. 
Less than 62 	The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or 
	(b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in IRC § 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
	This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified participant" as defined in IRC § 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in IRC § 415(b)(2)(I). 
 
(4)  With respect to subclause (3)a.1.i., subclause (3)a.2.i. and subparagraph (3)b. above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a participant's death between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the participant prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the participant's death if the plan does not charge participants for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in IRC § 417(c), upon the participant's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the twelve-month period which is used for application of the limitations under IRC § 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the participant has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the secretary of the treasury under IRC § 415(d). 
(8)  In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(9)  Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory participant contributions (unless picked up by the city) or rollover contributions shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under IRC § 415. 
(10)  Should any participant participate in more than one (1) defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one (1) annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (2) of this subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under IRC § 415) social security supplements described in IRC § 411(a)(9) and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of IRC § 415, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under IRC § 415 and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of IRC § 415 and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of IRC § 415. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in IRC §§ 401(a)(17) and 415, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in IRC § 402(g)(3)), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the participant and which is not includible in the gross income of the participant by reason of IRC § 125 or 457. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the participant by reason of IRC § 132(f)(4). For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half (2½) months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
• April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (70½) years; or 
• April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 16-115. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (70½), if later. 
2.  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
1.  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)a. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
i.  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
ii.  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
2.  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of § 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)b., or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)a., (4)b. and (4)c. below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of IRC § 401(a)(9) and the treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in IRC § 414(k) will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of IRC § 401(a)(9) and the treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year; 
2.  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
3.  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
4.  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
i.  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
ii.  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of IRC § 414(p); 
iii.  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
iv.  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under clause (2)a.1. or (2)a.2., whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  [Beginning date.] For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)a. above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under IRC § 401(a)(9) and § 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in § 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the treasury regulations. 
(d)  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
1.  Any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; 
2.  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC § 401(a)(9); 
3.  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the participant; and 
4.  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC § 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in IRC § 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC § 408(b), an annuity plan described in IRC § 403(a), an annuity contract described in IRC § 403(b), a qualified trust described in IRC § 401(a), an eligible plan under IRC § 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of IRC § 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(4)  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in IRC § 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in IRC § 401(a)(9)(E) who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in IRC § 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in IRC § 408(b) shall be considered a distributee. 
(5)  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  [Maximum mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in IRC § 401(a)(31), payable under the plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with IRC § 401(a)(17)(B). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). 
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under IRC § 401(a)(17) shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to participants and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

(22)  Medical waste. Except those specifically authorized by the director of utilities in a wastewater discharge permit. 
(c)  Regulation of waste from other jurisdictions. 
(1)  Discharges received from entities outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the city are regulated to the same extent, as are discharges from within its jurisdictional boundaries. Any multi-jurisdictional agreements amended or initiated after the effective date of this article shall comply with this section. 
(2)  If another jurisdiction or user located within another jurisdiction contributes wastewater to the WWTP, the control authority shall enter into an agreement with the contributing jurisdiction. 
(3)  Prior to entering into an agreement required by subsection (c)(2) above, the control authority shall request the following information from the contributing jurisdiction: 
a.  A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to the WWTP by the contributing jurisdiction; 
b.  An inventory of all users located within the contributing jurisdiction that are discharging to the WWTP; and 
c.  Such other information as the control authority may deem necessary. 
(4)  An agreement required by subsection (c)(2) above shall contain the following conditions: 
a.  All contributors to the WWTP shall comply with this article and the specific pollutant limits; 
b.  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to submit a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis; 
c.  A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing jurisdiction, which of these activities will be conducted by the control authority, and which of these activities will be conducted jointly by the contributing jurisdiction and the control authority; 
d.  A requirement for the contributing jurisdiction to provide the control authority with access to all information that the contributing jurisdiction obtains as part of its pretreatment activities; 
e.  Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing jurisdiction's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the WWTP; 
f.  Requirements for monitoring the contributing jurisdiction's discharge; 
g.  A provision ensuring the control authority access to the facilities of users located within the contributing entity's jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, enforcement, and any other duties deemed necessary by the control authority; and 
h.  A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms of the agreement. 
When the director of utilities determines that a user(s) is contributing to the WWTP, any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the WWTP, the director of utilities shall: (1) Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution of the WWTP; and (2) Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the interference with the WWTP. 
(d)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The director of utilities shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under Rule 62-625.410, F.A.C. 
(e)  Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system ninety-five (95) per cent of the samples taken when measured, according to the procedures set forth in Rule 62-625.420, F.A.C. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in Rule 62-625.420, F.A.C. are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(f)  Specific pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the city's WWTP using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of WWTP employees, and adverse effects on wastewater residuals disposal. No industrial user shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWTP operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective thirty (30) days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWTP. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following location: City of Cocoa Beach, Water Reclamation Department, 1600 Westend Minutemen Causeway, Cocoa Beach, FL. All of the following shall be excluded from the treatment works unless certain conditions and volumes of pretreatment have been specifically described and approved by the director of utilities: Antimony, berylium, biamuth, molybdenum, rhenium, strontium, tellurium, uranylion. 
(g)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. The developed local limits were established and will be re-evaluated as needed to assure that the treatment facility, its personnel and the environment is adequately protected. Local limits will be applied on a concentration basis and be included in industrial user permits. 
(h)  City's right of revisions. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system, if deemed necessary, to comply with the objectives presented in section 19-31(a) of this article. The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the WWTP. In no case shall a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with Chapter 62-625, F.A.C. The individual user may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the EPA or FDEP. Such a request shall be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA or FDEP when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance shall comply with the procedural and substantive provisions of Chapter 62-625, F.A.C. 
(i)  Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. 
(j)  Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. These spill containment plans must include a description of discharge practices; description of stored chemicals; procedures for notifying the WWTP; procedures to prevent accidental or slug discharges. All existing users shall complete such a plan within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this article. No user who commences contribution to the WWTP after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the WWTP of the incident. Its notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(k)  Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the director of utilities a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWTP, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(l)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(m)  [Interceptors.] Grease, oil, hair, and sand interceptors shall be provided for laundries, restaurants, service stations, auto repair shops, car washes, or other facilities when, in the opinion of City of Cocoa Beach, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of flammable wastes, grease and oil, sand or other harmful substances; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity as outlined by City of Cocoa Beach's guidelines and procedures. The grease trap shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at its expense. Grease shall be removed or cleaned from such interceptors at a frequency determined by City of Cocoa Beach, but in no case at an interval greater than once per one hundred eighty (180) days. The entire contents (grease, liquid, settled material), shall be removed or cleaned from the interceptor once per year. All costs for removal of material or cleaning of the interceptor shall be at the user's expense. Cleaning records, such as waste manifests, shall be retained by the user. 
(n)  Hauled wastewater. A septic tank waste may be discharged into the WWTP only at locations and times designated by the director of utilities. Such waste shall not violate the pretreatment standards or any city regulations. The haulers must obtain a permit by the city and track every load discharged.

Any industrial user or control authority subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall be required to retain for a minimum of three (3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the control authority. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or control authority. 
(14)  Provisions governing hazardous waste. 
a.  The industrial user shall notify the control authority and the FDEP hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities in writing of any discharge into the WWTP of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under Chapter 62-730, F.A.C. Such notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms (one hundred (100) kg/L) of such waste per calendar month to the WWTP, the notification shall also contain information (to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user) identifying the hazardous constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and estimating the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this article shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection shall be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges shall be submitted under subsection (c)(10) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (c), (e) and (f) of this section. 
b.  Industrial users shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection (c)(14)a. of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C. Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C., requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new FDEP regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the control authority and the department's hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated. 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. The user shall provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems by the city and FDEP. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that landscaping or parked vehicles will not obstruct it. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city. 
(e)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representatives speedy access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and reproduction or in the performance of any of their duties. The city and FDEP shall have the right to set up on the user's property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force that would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel, from the city and FDEP will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected, monitored, metered and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. The provisions of F.S. §§ 933.20 through 933.30, inclusive, relating to inspection warrants, are hereby adopted by reference in this article. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the WWTP performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance certification required under the provisions of 40 CFR 403.12(b)(6) and 403.12(d). In addition, where the WWTP itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
(1)  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user facility at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(2)  The control authority performs sampling at the user facility between the time when the user performs sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(f)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
The city shall annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the city a list of the users that were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. 
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA upon request. 
(g)  Right of refusal. The city hereby reserves the right to refuse waste from any lot or parcel of land upon which there is located any institutional, commercial or industrial plants, building or premises which does not comply fully with this section, or that does not utilize city water, or that does not supply proper metering of its waste, or that is not within the city limits. 
(h)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of destruction of public property. 
(g)  Affirmative defense. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 19-32 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature of constituents from the user's prior discharge when the WWTP was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. An affirmative defense shall not apply to the specific prohibitions in subsections 19-32(b)(1), 19-32(b)(3) and 19-32(b)(20). 
(3)  Demonstration of upset per 62-625.840 F.A.C. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

b.  The industrial user's facility was, at the time of the upset, being properly operated; and 
c.  The industrial user has orally submitted the following information to the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, with a written submission to be provided within five (5) days. 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance, 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue, and 
3.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  A bypass per 62-625.860 was required and conditions of section (3) of that rule are applicable. 
(h)  Consent orders. The city may enter into consent orders, stipulations, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any property owner or user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the property owner or user to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified in the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(i)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are nonexclusive. The city may take any, all, or any combination of the enforcement actions against a noncompliant property owner or user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city may take other action against any property owner or user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is authorized to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant property owner or user.

(a)  No person or firm, whether public, private, nonprofit or not for profit shall construct, operate or continue to operate a private communications system which occupies the streets, public rights-of-way and other public places within the city without having been issued a telecommunication permit by the director of public works, or a franchise for telephone, telecommunication service, video distribution system or cable television or cable communication system by the city. 
(b)  Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be a term and condition of any telecommunication permit issued in accordance herewith that as a part of the consideration supporting the issuance of such telecommunication permit and the city's permission thereby to occupy and use the streets of the city, that the permittee shall pay each year to the city compensation and license fees as follows: 
(1)  All applicants shall pay a permit application fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
(2)  For providers of long distance access or long distance service, other than the franchised local exchange carrier, a minimum fee or five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year per cable or five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year per cable per linear mile or any portions thereof per mile whichever is greater or the maximum allowed by law, whichever is greater. 
(3)  For private communication systems owned by a nonfranchised entity, a minimum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year or five hundred dollars ($500.00) per linear mile, whichever is greater, or any part thereof, per year for systems extending over one (1) mile. In no case shall the annual fee be less than five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(4)  Lines, cables or fiber optics of a private communication system placed in a conduit or duct-bank owned by another permittee or franchisee shall require a separate telecommunication application and permit, subject to the same requirements as other installations, except the fee for the additional telecommunications permit shall be one-half (½) the maximum allowed by law or one-half (½) of the otherwise applicable per linear mile fee for the portion of the pathway so utilized, whichever is greater. 
(5)  Lines, cables or fiber optics of a private communication system which are placed in a conduit or duct-bank owned by an entity not exempt by law or statute from the provisions of this article shall require a telecommunication permit, unless the franchise, or other authorization by which the exempt entity has the right to place the conduit or duct-bank within the city property, prohibits the application of the permit and fee requirements contained in this article to the lessee of space within the conduit or duct-bank. 
(6)  Any private communication system that serves customers and charges a fee for services provided by the private communication system within the city shall pay (in addition to applicable fees in sections 22-14(a) through (e) monthly, due on the tenth day of each month for the previous month, five (5) per cent of the annual total gross revenues from such customers to be calculated on the basis of all revenues derived from transmissions that bypass the local exchange carrier. Revenues derived from transmissions that enter a private communication system through the Local Access Transport Area (LATA) shall not be part of the total gross revenues for purposes of calculating compensation and license fees. 
The city may, at its option, adjust this permit fee each year to the extent allowed by law or by an amount not exceeding the proportional cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the United States Department of Labor for Urban Wage Earners (1967 - 100%). Since the initial establishment of this permit fee, or since the most recent increase in the permit fee for any and all subsequent increases after the first increase, and only after a public hearing by the city commission and at least thirty (30) days notice to all permittees, except as hereinafter provided. The city may raise the license fee more than the cumulative increase in the CPI in the event there is competent evidence that the fee imposed by the city is below the norm of fees imposed by other cities within the State of Florida which impose such fees and which have populations similar in size to Cocoa Beach. 
(c)  The annual compensation and license fee provided for in section 22-14(b) shall be payable annually on or before October 1 of each calendar year for the portion of the private communications systems within the city right-of-way on January 1 of that year and a pro-rated license fee, based upon the calendar quarter in which the application is filed, shall be paid at the time of the application for a telecommunication permit for all new portions of the system. Revenue fees are due monthly. 
(d)  Fees not paid within ten (10) days after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of one (1) per cent per month from the date due until paid. 
(e)  The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the city shall not be construed as an acknowledgement that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and payable. 
(1)  All fee payments shall be subject to audit by the city and assessment or refund if the payment is found to be in error. 
(2)  In the event that such audit results in an assessment by an additional payment to the city, such additional payment shall, at the city's option, be subject to interest at the rate of one (1) per cent per month retroactive to the date such payment originally should have been paid, which shall be due and payable immediately. 
(f)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the liability of the permittee for all applicable federal, state and local taxes. 
(g)  Any holder of a telecommunication permit must be a member of Sunshine Location network or any subsequent alert and warning system to protect and locate their underground facilities, including fiber optic facilities. The permittee shall be responsible for making all arrangements with public or private utility companies to ensure underground and overhead clearances and construction liaison when needed.

(a)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, when reasonably practicable but no later than twelve (12) months after notice from the city, a franchisee shall make such technically and commercially feasible improvements to its system as may be necessary to bring the system to the state of the art. The state of the art shall be made available to subscribers in the same categories (e.g. residential, commercial, etc.) as in the cable system owned or operated by franchisee, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries serving Brevard County. The availability of a specific level of cable system technical performance, capacity, equipment, components and service (without reference to the content of service) on any cable system owned or operated by the franchisee, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries serving Brevard County shall create a presumption of technical and commercial feasibility, provided, however, that the franchisee may make a showing to the contrary which, if sufficient, shall overcome the presumption. Such showing shall be made to the city commission, which shall determine whether a showing of competent and substantial evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption has been made, subject to a challenge to such determination in an appropriate legal proceeding. The city shall grant extensions of the time within which a franchisee must comply with the obligations set forth herein, to accommodate the process to be afforded a franchisee hereunder, for good cause shown (including evidence that the franchisee has commenced necessary measures to comply with the obligations herein), but in no event to exceed twelve (12) months. 
(1)  Any cable system that commences construction, including but not limited to initial construction, rebuild, upgrade, or reconstruction after the effective date of this chapter shall have a minimum capacity of at least 750 MHZ providing no less than seventy-eight (78) video channels available for immediate use.

b.  A franchisee shall, upon request, provide at least one (1) standard installation for basic cable television service to each and every city government building within its franchise area that is passed by its cable system and shall provide basic cable service to those installations at no cost to the city and shall charge no more than its costs for any additional basic cable service outlets to such facilities.

(9)  Any and all rights which the city may have, now or in the future, to regulate a franchisee's provision of cable Internet services are hereby reserved by the city and may be exercised at any time throughout the term of the franchise, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. If a franchisee provides access to its system to Internet service providers on an open, nondiscriminatory basis on a cable system owned or operated by the franchisee, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries serving Brevard County, franchisee shall provide access on such basis on any service which the franchisee provides in the city.

(b)  A franchisee shall make cable service available to every dwelling within the franchise area as defined in a franchise agreement unless prohibited by a private property owner from doing so; provided that such dwelling is in an area of density of at least twenty-five (25) dwelling units per cable mile. For purposes of this section, if a franchisee has not been granted the authority by an owner or associations of owners to extend its facilities to individual apartments, condominiums, and co-operative units within the interior or a multiple-unit buildings or complex of buildings, then any such multiple-unit building or complex of buildings shall be considered a single dwelling unit. Density per cable mile shall be computed by dividing the number of dwelling units in the area by the length, in miles or fractions thereof, of the total amount of aerial or underground cable necessary to make service available to the dwelling units in such area in accordance with the franchisee's system design parameters. The cable length shall be measured from the nearest point of access to the then-existing system, provided that extension is technically feasible from that point of access, and located within the public streets. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, service shall be required for new developments located adjacent to an area which already meets the density requirement in subsection (b) above, but only to the extent, in whole or in part, to which such development has been platted consistent with the density requirement in subsection (b) above, and public utility facilities are being or have been extended.

The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
(d)  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the city of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.

(2)  To the extent a franchisee's billing schedule allows, each franchisee shall provide written notice in or on its monthly billing, at the request of the city, of any city meeting regarding requests or applications by the franchisee for renewal, transfer or modification of its franchise. The city shall make such a request in writing, with reasonable notice prior to the mailing of any billing by franchisee, such that franchisee's regular billing cycle shall not be interrupted. Said notices shall be made at franchisee's expense and said expense shall not be considered part of the franchise fee assessed pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered part of the franchise fee, as defined in Section 622 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. In addition, franchisee shall, consistent with applicable law, provide written notice in or on its monthly billing of any change in service, rates or charges to subscribers unless such written notification takes place by separate mailing or other means. 
(3)  Franchisee bills shall be clear, concise and understandable to subscribers. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(4)  Credits for service or refunds shall be issued no later than thirty (30) days of the next billing cycle of the customer following the determination that a credit or refund is warranted. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(5)  A franchisee shall provide subscribers, the city commission, and the city manager with at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of any changes in rates, charges, channel lineup, or initiations or discontinuations or changes of service or services offered over the cable system whenever practicable. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(o)  Except in the case of a system malfunction, upon a subscriber's request, a franchisee shall provide a refund or credit to the account of the subscriber, prorated on a daily basis, for any period of four (4) hours or more within a 24-hour period during which a subscriber experienced an interruption of service or substantial impairment of service, whether due to a system malfunction or other cause. No refunds shall be due for service interruptions directly related to a rebuild, upgrade or routine maintenance of the cable system which is planned, noticed properly to subscribers, and occurs during a time other than between 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. and lasts for four (4) hours or less. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(p)  Billing. 
(1)  The first billing statement of the franchisee after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(2)  The billing statement of the franchisee must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Statements shall also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
(3)  Any balance not received within ten (10) days after the due date may be assessed an administrative charge. However, in no event shall administrative charges for an overdue balance accumulated against any individual subscriber exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The charge shall appear on the billing statement for the following month. Any administrative charge applied to unpaid bills shall be subject to regulation by the city consistent with applicable law. Subscribers shall not be charged an administrative fee, a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(4)  The franchisee must notify the subscriber that payment can be remitted in person at the office of the franchisee in the city and inform the subscriber of the address of that office where payment can be made. 
(5)  Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(q)  No charge may be made for any service or product which the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. Subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or equipment may be made orally or in writing. Franchisee's material failure to comply with this subsection may result in a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation, per day or part thereof that the violation continues. 
(r)  The franchisee shall, upon request, certify in writing to the city, based upon internal due diligence by the franchisee, that to the best of franchisee's knowledge it is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in this section. At the request of the city, the franchisee shall submit such documentation as may be required to demonstrate compliance with this section. This documentation shall be submitted within forty-five (45) days of the receipt by the franchisee of the city's request. 
(s)  Responsibility for the administration of this chapter, and any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, and for the resolution of all complaints referred to the city against a franchisee regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and related matters, is hereby delegated to the city manager (who can in turn designate to a city employee), who is empowered, among other things, to settle, or compromise any controversy arising from operations of the franchisee, on behalf of the city, in accordance with the best interests of the public. In cases where requests for service have been ignored or in cases where the service provided is unsatisfactory for whatever reason, the city manager or designee, hereafter referred to jointly as city manager, shall have the power to require the franchisee to provide service consistent with the terms of the franchise, if in the opinion of the city manager or designee such request for service is reasonable. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, including the franchisee, may appeal the matter to the city commission for hearing and determination. The city commission may accept, reject or modify the decision of the city manager. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise, whether instituted by the city manager or by the city commission shall be contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any franchise agreement issued pursuant to this chapter, and neither the city manager nor the city commission, in the adjustment, settlement, or compromise of any controversy shall have the right or authority to add to, modify or delete any provision of this chapter or of the franchise, or to interfere with any rights of subscribers or any franchisee under applicable federal, or state law or private contract. 
(t)  (1)  The fines to which the franchisee is subject as set forth in this section are to be assessed by the city commission on a per violation basis, with each day of a continuing violation constituting a separate violation. Where a credit required by this section is not possible because service has been terminated, franchisee shall issue a refund to the former subscriber for the appropriate amount. 
(2)  Prior to the city commission's assessment of a fine pursuant to this chapter, the city manager shall mail to the franchisee a written notice, by hand delivery or certified or registered mail, of the proposed fine, specifying the violation at issue. The franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written notice to file a written response to the notice of the city manager or his/her designee as to whether the violation has been cured. The written response of the franchisee shall be signed by management level personnel of franchisee and all statements contained therein shall be regarded as material representations of the franchisee to the city. 
(3)  The city shall consider any justification or mitigating factor advanced in the written response of the franchisee, including but not limited to rebates or credits to the subscriber or a cure of the violation. The city may not assess any fine if the franchisee has reasonably resolved the complaint or cured the violation within a reasonable time frame. However, said subscriber may be entitled to a credit or refund as provided herein. 
(4)  Subsequent to the notice of proposed fine to franchisee, and consideration of the response of the franchisee, if any, the city may, after a public hearing at which franchisee shall have an opportunity to heard, issue an assessment of fine. The fine shall be paid within thirty (30) days of written notice to the franchisee or, if franchisee challenges the assessment in a court of competent jurisdiction, within thirty (30) days of a final nonappealable decision that the assessment is valid. If said refund, credit or fine is not paid by franchisee within such thirty (30) day period, as the case may be, the city may, at its discretion, withdraw immediately the amount thereof from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the city shall notify franchisee of the withdrawal amount, after which franchisee shall have ten (10) days from the date of such notice to deposit in the security fund an amount sufficient to restore the security fund to the amount specified in the franchise agreement. This fine shall constitute liquidated damages to the city for the violation and the city may enforce payment of the fine in any court having jurisdiction. It is the intent of the city to determine fines as a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by the city and/or its subscribers, whether actual or potential, and may include without limitation, increased costs of administration and other damages difficult to measure. 
(5)  Franchisee may appeal any decision of the city manager or his/her designee directly to the city commission within thirty (30) days of notice of the decision to the franchisee. 
(6)  Intentional material misrepresentation by a franchisee in any response to a notice of proposed credit, refund and/or fine, whether oral or written, shall be considered a material breach of the franchise agreement, subject to a penalty of no less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in liquidated damages to the city, and shall be grounds for franchise revocation. 
(7)  In addition to complying with the customer service standards set forth in this chapter or in any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter, a franchisee shall, at minimum, comply with all customer service standards applicable to cable systems of the FCC and any other applicable federal or state law concerning customer service standards, consumer protection, and unfair or deceptive trade practices. 
(8)  The city expressly reserves the right to consider violations of the customer service requirements in evaluating any renewal, modification or transfers of any franchise, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law.

A franchisee shall not condition subscriber or other service on the subscriber's grant of permission to disclose information which, pursuant to federal or state law, cannot be disclosed without the subscriber's explicit consent.

(b)  Unless otherwise permitted by federal or state law, neither the franchisee nor its agents or employees shall, without the prior and specific written authorization of the subscriber involved, sell, or otherwise make available for commercial purposes the names, addresses or telephone numbers of any subscriber or subscribers, or any information which identifies the individual viewing habits of any subscriber or subscribers. 
(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-20. - Discrimination prohibited. 
(a)  No franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant any illegal undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers, nor subject any such persons or group of persons to any illegal undue prejudice or any disadvantage. A franchisee shall not deny, delay, or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, or marital status except for discounts for senior citizens, the economically disadvantaged or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee may also offer bulk discounts to multiple dwelling buildings to the extent such discounts are otherwise permissible by law.

(c)  A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, nor discharge from employment, nor discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or marital status.

(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-21. - Use of streets. 
(a)  Any pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved area taken up or any excavations made by a franchisee shall be done in compliance with city requirements under permits issued for work by the proper officials of the city, and shall be done in such manner as to give the least inconvenience to the inhabitants of the city. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt a franchisee from compliance with applicable provisions of this Code, concerning permitting, and the payment of the appropriate fees established pursuant to said provisions. 
(b)  A franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved areas in as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done, and shall also prepare, maintain and provide to the city engineer full and complete plats, maps and records showing the exact locations of its facilities located within the public streets, ways, and easements of the city. These maps shall be available to the city engineer. 
(c)  Except to the extent required by law, a franchisee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove, any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or widening, change of street grade, installation or sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal or public utility improvements; provided, however, that the franchisee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place. Franchisee shall do so at its expense to the extent other users of the rights-of-way are so responsible, consistent with applicable law. 
(d)  A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the case where the requesting person is the city, in which case no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall be given not less than five (5) business days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(e)  A franchisee shall upon notice to the city of not less than seven (7) days, emergency situations excepted, have the authority to trim the trees or other natural growth upon and overhanging the Streets so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires, cables and other equipment of the franchisee, except that, at the option of the city, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the franchisee. 
(f)  A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing underground conduits (if applicable) or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible and if available on reasonable terms and conditions. Copies of agreements between a franchisee and third party for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the city upon request provided that the franchisee shall have the right to redact proprietary and confidential information in such agreements as it pertains to financial arrangements between the parties. 
(g)  All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. The city may issue such generally applicable rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a cable system installed in, on, or over the streets, as may be consistent with this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(h)  All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any preexisting gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the preexisting facilities of various utilities serving the residents of the city of their use of any Street or any other public right of way. 
(i)  A franchisee shall, at all times: 
(1)  Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the city's building code and electrical safety ordinances and any other applicable building or electrical safety code, and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of the city. 
(2)  Keep and maintain in a safe, suitable, substantial condition, and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment, and connections in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways or places of the city, wherever situated or located. 
(j)  On streets where electrical or telephone utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located underground at the franchisee's expense only if the utilities in the area are also required to relocate their facilities underground at their expense or at such time other utilities elect to locate underground. Between a street and a subscriber's residence, a franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. The city shall encourage, to the extent feasible, that the public utility and the franchisee cooperate in opening up trenches and making such trenches available to all parties with the understanding that the costs of opening and refilling of such trenches would be shared proportionately by all users of such trenches. 
(k)  In the event the use of any part of a cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street without complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or expired, without right of renewal, the franchisee, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the city, shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the city may require. 
(l)  The city may extend the time for the removal of franchisee's equipment and facilities for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, and thereafter such equipment and facilities may be deemed abandoned, unless franchisee is diligently pursuing the removal. 
(m)  In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee shall restore the area to as good a condition as prior to such removal or abandonment. 
(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-22. - Enforcement remedies. 
(a)  In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity or provided herein under section 25.5-18, the city may apply any one or combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise agreement, applicable state or federal law, or applicable local law or order: 
(1)  Impose liquidated damages in such amount, whether on a per diem, per incident, or other measure of violation, as provided in this chapter or in a franchise agreement. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement and the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  Impose as liquidated damages a fine in an amount not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for failure to obtain a franchise agreement from the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  Impose as liquidated damages a fine in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) per day per violation for material failure to comply with any provision of this chapter, except as otherwise provided for in section 25.5-18 or as otherwise provided for in a franchise agreement. 
(4)  In the event of a material failure to comply with the provision of this chapter, revoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in section 25.5-25. 
(5)  In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the city may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the city shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person or persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the city determines are appropriate to the public interest. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, franchisee's failure to comply with subsection 25.5-13(a) may result in the assessment of liquidated damages in the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per day for each day such violation continues. 
(d)  Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of a franchise agreement or this chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
(e)  In any proceeding wherein there exists an issue with respect to a franchisee's performance of its obligations pursuant to this chapter, the franchisee shall provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms of this chapter. The city commission may find a franchisee that does not demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter in default and apply any one (1) or combination of the remedies otherwise authorized by this chapter. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and notwithstanding being subjected to a fine or refund requirement, franchisee shall be obligated to cure, or take all reasonably practicable steps to cure, any violation of this chapter or of any franchise agreement granted hereto within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice from the city of the alleged violation. If the alleged violation is not cured within such period, the city may exercise all rights and remedies available pursuant to this chapter, or applicable law, or the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-23. - Renewal of franchise. 
Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. To the extent such additional requirements are consistent with applicable law, the following requirements shall apply: 
(a)  Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, should that process be invoked, the city may notify the franchisee, by certified or registered mail that it may file a renewal application in the form of a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal proposal and the deadline for filing the application, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of the notice. 
1.  The application shall comply with the requirements of section 25.5-8 to the extent specifically applicable to franchise renewals and provide the specific information requested in the notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the date specified in the city's notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this subsection, the city may take such action as appropriate under law. 
2.  Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The city, following prior public notice, may hold one or more public hearings on the renewal application. 
(b)  In the event a public hearing on the renewal application is held, or in the event that the city commission considers the renewal application without a public hearing, the city commission may either: 
1.  Pass a resolution approving the proposed franchise agreement and thereby renew the franchise; or 
2.  Only after a public hearing properly noticed, pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. 
(c)  If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A)—(D) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. §§ 546(c)(1)(A)—(D). Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with subsection (b) of § 546 shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in §§ 546(c)(1)(A)—(D), pursuant to the record of proceedings under § 546(c). The city shall not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under § 546(c)(1)(A) or on events considered under § 546(c)(1)(B) unless the city has provided the franchisee with notice and opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object, or the franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the city fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(d)  Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(h). The city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the city commission shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. 
(e)  If the city commission grants a renewal application, the city and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in subsections 25.5-8(e)—(h), before such renewal becomes effective. 
(f)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied, the city may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system or effect a transfer to another person upon approval of the city commission. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. The city may not acquire ownership of the system while an appeal of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to 47 U.S.C § 546(e). 
(g)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied and no appeal to a court is pending, and the city does not purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system to another person, the city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-24. - Transfers. 
(a)  No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(b)  An application for a transfer of a franchise shall meet the requirements of section 25.5-8, and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. The application shall provide, at a minimum, the information required in subsections 25.5-8(e)(1)—(5) with respect to the proposed transferee. The information required in subsections 25.5-8(e)(6)—(13) shall also be provided whenever the proposed transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas. 
(c)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the city commission shall consider the legal, financial, and technical capacity of the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in substantial compliance with the material terms of its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest. 
(d)  No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing, in the form of an affidavit signed by a duly authorized officer of the transferee, that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee to the city under this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(Ord. No. 1228, § 2, 2-3-2000)  
Sec. 25.5-25. - Revocation or termination of franchise. 
(a)  A franchise may be revoked by the city commission for a franchisee's material failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, or for any other material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise agreement. To invoke the provisions of this subsection, the city shall give the franchisee written notice, by certified mail at the last known address, that franchisee is in material violation of this chapter or in material breach of the franchise agreement and describing the nature of the alleged violation or breach with specificity. If within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of such written notice from the city to the franchisee, the franchisee has not cured such violation or breach, or has not commenced corrective action and such corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to revoke the franchise, stating its reasons. 
(b)  Prior to revoking a franchise under subsection (a) above, the city commission shall hold a public hearing, upon thirty (30) calendar days notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing the city commission may determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and other evidence of record.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 26-1. - Authority to impound. 
Police officers are hereby authorized to remove a vehicle from a street to the nearest garage or other place of safety, or to a garage designated or maintained by the police department, and being within the City of Coca Beach, under the circumstances hereinafter enumerated: 
(1)  When any vehicle is left unattended upon any bridge, causeway, or viaduct, where such vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic. 
(2)  When a vehicle upon a street is so disabled as to constitute an obstruction to traffic, or the person or persons in charge of the vehicle are by reason of physical injury incapacitated to such an extent as to be unable to provide for its custody and removal. 
(3)  When a vehicle is found being operated upon the streets and is not in proper condition. 
(4)  When any vehicle is left unattended upon a street and is so parked illegally as to constitute a definite hazard or obstruction to the normal movement of traffic. 
(5)  When any vehicle is left unattended upon a street continuously for more than twenty-four (24) hours and may be presumed to be abandoned. 
(6)  When the driver of such vehicle is taken into custody by the police department and such vehicle would thereby be left unattended upon a street. 
(7)  When removal is necessary in the interest of public safety because of fire, flood, storm, or other emergency reason. 
(8)  Any person taken into custody pursuant to Section 316.192 or 316.193, Florida Statutes 1979, may be released without posting bond, if such person agrees to the impounding in a garage authorized by this chapter of the vehicle owned and driven by such person or to surrender his driver's license to insure such person's appearance in court to answer the charges and pay such fine as may be assessed. 
(9)  No vehicle impounded in an authorized garage as herein provided shall be released there from until the charges for towing such vehicle into the garage and storage charges have been paid. The charge for towing or removal of any such vehicle and storage charges shall be fixed by the county judge, such charges to be based upon a computation of all actual expenses entering into the current cost of such services. Such charge or charges shall be posted for public inspection in the office of the traffic violations bureau and in any authorized garage. 
(Ord. No. 384, § 2, 1-20-1972; Ord. No. 627, § 15, 7-2-1980; Ord. No. 668, § 12, 8-20-1981)  
Sec. 26-1A. - Authority to use an impoundment device. 
(1)  Police officers, or such officers as are assigned by the chief of police, may immobilize a vehicle in such manner to prevent the operation of such vehicle remaining in violation of this chapter in an on-street or public parking lot space, the use of which is regulated by an official sign or parking meter. If a vehicle remains in an on-street or public parking lot space for any period longer than twenty-four (24) hours, then the vehicle may be immobilized by an impoundment device. For a parking lot space governed by an official sign, the violation time runs from the expiration of time allowed on said official sign and continues for twenty-four (24) hours. Similarly, if the parking lot space is governed by a parking meter, the violation time runs from the time the meter shows violation, and continues for twenty-four (24) hours. After the vehicle has been fitted with an impoundment device, the vehicle will remain at the original on-street or parking lot space for an additional twenty-four (24) hours, allowing the responsible owner to take necessary action to move the vehicle. However, after the expiration of the second twenty-four-hour time period, the vehicle will be towed. 
(2)  The registered owner of any vehicle with five (5) or more outstanding unpaid parking violations shall be notified by mail that their vehicle is subject to immobilization under the provisions of this section. The notice shall provide the owner with a detailed list of the outstanding parking violations and that their vehicle may be immobilized and impounded, pursuant to this section. The owner will be provided an opportunity to contest the validity of the proposed immobilization and impoundment upon written request to the chief of police, within fifteen (15) days of city's mailing of notice. 
(3)  Any registered owner, as referred to in subsection (2), may request a timely administrative hearing, in order to be given an opportunity to contest the validity of the proposed immobilization and impoundment. Such hearing shall be scheduled as soon as practicable before the city manager, his designee or a special magistrate. The city's designated hearing officer shall be solely responsible for conducting a hearing and rendering a decision. If a special magistrate is used and the owner's challenge is unsuccessful, fees for the special magistrate and the city attorney's attendance at an administrative hearing may be assessed as a cost of the impoundment. 
(4)  Any action under this section shall be stayed pending the decision rendered at a timely requested hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to provide an opportunity to contest the validity of a proposed immobilization and not to contest the merits of the parking violations. 
(5)  Absent a stay as provided in subsection (4), at any time, officers of the police department, or such other officers as are assigned by the chief of police, may immobilize those vehicles found parked upon any street, or any off-street parking area in the city where five (5) or more unpaid parking tickets have accumulated against the vehicle for which there has been no payment, court order, adjudication or response by the vehicle owner. 
(6)  The police department having immobilized a vehicle, under this section, shall conspicuously affix a notice to such vehicle, and shall mail, by the end of the next business day, to the last known address of the registered owner of the vehicle, a notice. The notice, on a form provided by the city, notifies the owner to pay the civil penalty specified, and informs the owner of the vehicle that: 
a.  Such vehicle (specifying the license number and listing the parking violation notices issued to such vehicle) has been immobilized pursuant to and by the authority of this section; and 
b.  The owner of such immobilized vehicle shall be permitted to repossess, or secure release of the vehicle, upon compliance with either of the following alternative procedures: 
1.  Payment to the director of finance, or his designee, of the total civil penalty, including delinquent fees, for each violation and an immobilization service fee set forth in section 26-29, penalty, as amended. 
2.  By requesting an administrative hearing, within fifteen (15) days of the city's mailing of notice. 
(7)  If, after contacting the appropriate state agency, which acts as a custodian of vehicle registration and license tag records, the police department is unable to determine the motor vehicle owner's address, the motor vehicle may be immobilized in accordance with the provisions of this section, except that the mailing notice, under subsection (2), is not required. 
(8)  If the owner of the immobilized vehicle does not make arrangements for the removal of the immobilization device within twenty-four (24) hours of the time such motor vehicle is immobilized, then the police department may remove such vehicle to a garage, or other place of safety, in accordance with section 26-1. Any towing service charges, incurred pursuant to this subsection, shall be additional costs to be assessed to the registered owner of the vehicle. 
(9)  No vehicle immobilized, in accordance with this section, shall be immobilized by any means other than by the use of an impoundment device or other mechanism, which will cause no damage to such vehicle, unless the vehicle is moved while such device or mechanism is in place. 
(10)  No person, except as may be authorized by the police department, shall remove, attempt to remove, tamper with, in any way damage, or alter the immobilization device. A violation of this subsection shall result in the civil penalty, set forth in section 26-29, as amended. 
(11)  Any vehicle immobilized pursuant to this section shall be subject to impoundment as authorized by section 26-1. 
(Ord. No. 1502, § 2, 12-3-2009)  
Sec. 26-2. - Notice of impounding. 
(1)  Whenever an officer removes a vehicle from a street as authorized in section 26-1, and the officer knows or is able to ascertain the name and address of the owner thereof, such officer shall immediately give or cause to be given notice in writing to such owner of the fact of such removal, and the reasons therefor, and of the place to which such vehicle has been removed. In the event any such vehicle is stored in an authorized garage, a copy of such notice shall be given to the proprietor of such garage. 
(2)  Whenever an officer removes a vehicle from a street under section 26-1, and does not know and is not able to ascertain the name of the owner, or for any other reason is unable to give the notice to the owner as hereinbefore provided, and in the event the vehicle is not returned to the owner within a period of three (3) days, then and in that event the officer shall immediately send or cause to be sent written report of such removal by mail to the motor vehicle commission, and shall file copy of such notice with the proprietor of any authorized garage in which the vehicle may be stored. Such notice shall include a complete description of the vehicle, the date, time and place from which removed, the reasons for such removal, and the name of the garage or place where the vehicle is stored.

Chapter 26.5 - VACATION RENTALS  
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 26.5-1. - Authority, scope and purpose. 
This chapter is enacted under the home rule power of the City of Cocoa Beach in the interest of the health, peace, safety and general welfare. 
F.S. § 509.013, provides a distinction between "transient public lodging establishments," which are rented, or advertised or held out for rental to guests more than three (3) times in a calendar year for periods of less than thirty (30) days or one (1) calendar month, whichever is less; and "nontransient public lodging establishments," which are rented, or advertised or held out for rental to guests for periods of at least thirty (30) days or one (1) calendar month, whichever is less. 
F.S. § 509.242(1)(c), further provides for a subset of transient public lodging establishments, called "vacation rental" which is any unit or group of units in a condominium or cooperative or any individually or collectively owned single-family, two-family, three-family or four-family house or dwelling unit that is also a transient public lodging establishment, but that is not a timeshare project. 
It is the intent of this chapter to regulate vacation rentals as defined by Florida Statutes, as well as other transient public lodging establishments which are located in the RS-1 single family residential zoning district of the City of Cocoa Beach, which collectively are referred to herein as "vacation rentals". 
In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 883, (Chapter 2011-119, Laws of Florida), amending F.S. § 509.032(b) to provide that "[a] local law, ordinance, or regulation may not restrict the use of vacation rentals, prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate vacation rentals based solely on their classification, use or occupancy. This paragraph does not apply to any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011." 
In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 356 (Chapter 2014-71, Laws of Florida), amending that same statute to read "[a] local law, ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate the duration of frequency of rental of vacation rentals. This paragraph does not apply to any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011." 
The official statement of legislative intent of Senate Bill 356 as reflected in the House of Representatives' Final Bill Analysis, dated June 19, 2014, states that the "Effect of the Bill" is as follows: 
"The bill permits local governments to create regulation that distinguishes vacation rentals from other residential property. In the past, local government regulations have included noise, parking, registration, and signage requirements for vacation rentals. 
"The bill does not allow local governments to create regulations that would prohibit vacation rentals or restrict the duration or frequency of vacation rentals. These types of regulation remain preempted to the state. 
"The grandfather provision in existing law exempting any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011, is maintained. Any local law, ordinance, or regulation passed before that date that prohibits or restricts vacation rentals based on the duration or frequency may continue to be enforced." 
This Chapter does not prohibit Vacation Rentals, or the duration or frequency of Vacation Rentals, nor is it the intention of the City of Cocoa Beach to do so, but rather this Chapter is intended to address life safety and compatibility concerns in the interests of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 1621, § 1, 6-7-2018)  
Sec. 26.5-2. - Findings of facts. 
Based on information presented at various city commission meetings by residents of Cocoa Beach and owners and operators of vacation rentals, the practical first-hand experience and observations of city commissioners, common sense deductions of city commissioners based on long term experiences in Cocoa Beach, information learned by city commissioners from various residents, information from the U.S. Census, as well as evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city commission, and on the Short-Term Rental Housing Restrictions White Paper, prepared by Robinson & Cole, Attorneys at Law, in 2011, prepared for the National Association of Realtors&reg;, the city commission finds: 
(1)  Residents residing within their residential dwellings are inherently familiar with the local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress from their residential dwellings, thereby minimizing potential risks to themselves and their families. 
(2)  In contrast, transient occupants of vacation rentals, due to their transient nature, are typically not familiar with local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress from the vacation rentals in which they are staying, thereby increasing potential risks to themselves and their families, and putting an additional burden on, and potentially putting at risk, emergency personnel in the event of an emergency situation. 
(3)  Certain vacation rentals are presently located within the RS-1 single family residential zoning district of the City of Cocoa Beach. 
(4)  Vacation rentals, left unregulated, can create negative impacts within residential neighborhoods due to excessive noise, parking and traffic problems, excessive use and impact on public services and public works, extreme size and/or greater occupancy. 
(5)  Vacation rentals situated within residential neighborhoods can disturb the quiet nature and atmosphere of the residential neighborhoods, and the quiet enjoyment of its residents. 
(6)  Vacation rentals located within established residential neighborhoods can create negative compatibility impacts relating to extreme noise levels, late night activities, on-street parking issues and traffic congestion. 
(7)  A residential dwelling is typically the single largest investment a family will make with the residents of the residential dwelling desiring the tranquility and peaceful enjoyment of their neighborhood without excessive noise and increased parking issues and traffic congestion caused by transient occupants of vacation rentals. 
(8)  According to the 2017 U.S. Census estimates, the City of Cocoa Beach has an average household size of 1.97 persons. 
(9)  Vacation rentals situated in the RS-1 single family residential zoning district neighborhoods can and do create a great disparity in occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 1621, § 1, 6-7-2018)  
Sec. 26.5-3. - Definitions. 
The following terms as used in this chapter are defined as set forth hereinafter: 
Bedroom means any room in a vacation rental which has a bed or other place for sleeping and a separate closet that is an integral part of the permanent construction within the bedroom or an ensuite bathroom, and complies with the Florida Fire Code and Florida Life Safety Code as a bedroom, but shall not include a bathroom, a kitchen, a dining room, any main living area, or any exterior area or vessel. If a previously approved bedroom exists as of the effective date of this code, and does not have a separate closet that is an integral part of the permanent construction of the structure, but rather utilizes an armoire or other furniture piece for clothing storage, the requirement for a closet to qualify as a bedroom is waived. If there is more than one (1) living room, such additional living room can count as a bedroom as long as it has emergency egress as required for a bedroom. 
Occupant means any person who occupies a vacation rental overnight. The term "occupant" includes the owner, agent, or other person staying overnight at the vacation rental whether or not they are paying for the rental, so long as at least one (1) person at the vacation rental is paying for the rental. 
Owner occupied means the vacation rental is then occupied by person(s), at the vacation rental owner's consent, who do not pay rent for the occupancy of the vacation rental, when such persons are members of the family of the vacation rental owner, at a time when there are no person(s) occupying the vacation rental who are paying for such occupancy. 
Transient public lodging establishments means any unit, group of units, dwelling, building, or group of buildings within a single complex of buildings which is rented to guests more than three (3) times in a calendar year for periods of less than thirty (30) days or one (1) calendar month, whichever is less, or which is advertised or held out to the public as a place regularly rented to guests. 
Vacation rental is collectively a vacation rental as defined under Florida Statutes, and any transient public lodging establishment which is located in the RS-1 single family residential zoning district of the City of Cocoa Beach. 
Vacation rental owner is the fee simple owner of the vacation rental, whether an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust, or other entity. In the event the vacation rental owner is not an individual, each and every person who owns twenty (20) percent or more of the equitable interest in the vacation rental shall also be deemed a vacation rental owner. The duties and functions of a vacation rental owner may, at the option of the vacation rental owner, be performed by an agent of the vacation rental owner, so long as the vacation rental owner notifies the city in writing, on a form provided by the city, of the identity and contact information of such agent, and the specific duties that the agent will be performing for the vacation rental owner. The vacation rental owner may change the designation of agent at any time through the filing of a new form and the payment of an administrative fee in an amount as set by resolution by the city commission. The vacation rental owner shall be held responsible for all actions of such designated agent with respect to the applicable vacation rental.

Equivalent residential unit (ERU). The average impervious area in square feet of a residential unit within the city. The value of one ERU is two thousand nine hundred (2,900) square feet. 
Fee shall mean the stormwater drainage utility fee enacted herein. 
Hydrologic response means the manner and means by which stormwater collects upon real property and is conveyed from real property, and which is a function dependent upon a number of interacting factors, including, but not limited to, topography, vegetation, surficial geologic conditions, antecedent soil moisture conditions and groundwater conditions. The principal measures of the hydrologic system may be stated in terms of total runoff volume, as a percentage of total precipitation which runs off, or in terms of the peak rate of flow generated in the event of a storm of given duration and intensity, or statistical interval of return (frequency). 
Impervious surfaces means those hard-surfaced areas which either prevent or retard the entry of water into soil mantle, as it entered under natural conditions prior to development, and/or cause water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from that present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas and other surfaces which similarly impact the natural infiltration or runoff patterns which existed prior to development, including normal water in ponds or lakes.

Open drainage way means a natural or man-made conveyance system which has the specific function of transmitting natural stream water or storm runoff water from a point of higher elevation to a point of lower elevation, such as swales, ditches, canals, streams, creeks and gutters. 
Peak flow means the highest momentary rate of water flow, measured or estimated in cubic feet of water per second. It is differentiated from total flow volume by the introduction of a unit of time measure during which the maximum rate of flow is measured, calculated or estimated. 
Runoff control is any means approved by the city engineer by which the peak rate of stormwater runoff from developed land surfaces is reduced and the erosion created by stormwater is reduced. 
Total flow means the accumulative volume of water discharged from a property, basin or water shed. The total flow is quantified in measures such as acre feet or cubic feet of water. 
Utility means the stormwater drainage utility created hereby.

ARTICLE V. - FERTILIZER USE REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 28-41. - Purpose and intent. 
As a result of impairment to surface waters within the City of Cocoa Beach caused by excessive nutrients, the City of Cocoa Beach has determined that the use of fertilizers on lands within the city creates a risk of contributing to adverse effects on surface and/or groundwater. Accordingly, the City of Cocoa Beach finds that management measures for the use of fertilizers are required. 
This article regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. The article requires the use of best management practices which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on Cocoa Beach's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances and surface waters. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of Cocoa Beach's residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

Code enforcement officer means any designated agent or employee of the city whose duty it is to enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the city. The term "code enforcement officer" will be construed to include the duties and authority of code inspectors as set forth in Florida law.

(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014; Ord. No. 1606, § 2, 5-14-2017)  
Secs. 30-5—30-9. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE II. - SPECIAL MAGISTRATE/CODE ENFORCEMENT BOARD 
 
Sec. 30-10. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The intent and purpose of this article is to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating the position of special magistrate in addition to a use of a code enforcement board and granting the power and authority to hold hearings and to impose administrative fines including costs of prosecution and other noncriminal penalties,in order to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective, and inexpensive method of enforcing any code, ordinance, or regulation in effect within the city, where a violation or repeated violation exists. 
(b)  The means of code enforcement described in chapter 26, article III - intersection safety and chapter 30 - special magistrate are in addition to the provisions of chapter 30 or those otherwise allowed by law or equity. 
(1)  Chapter 26, article III - intersection safety describes the use of a special magistrate for traffic related violations in chapter 26. 
(2)  Chapter 30 - special magistrate/code enforcement board describes general code enforcement procedures and use of a notice of violation (NOV) issued by a code enforcement officer with a special magistrate/code enforcement board to enforce city codes. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-11. - Creation of position of special magistrate.

The special magistrate will include the officer(s) appointed by the city commission, including but not limited to any special magistrates pro tempore, with the power set forth in Section 30-10. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-12. - Reserved.  
Sec. 30-13. - Reserved.  
Sec. 30-14. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  Initiation of proceedings. It will be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate code enforcement proceedings and to schedule hearings with regard to city codes and standard building codes violations and the City Land Development Code using the special magistrate or a code enforcement board. 
(b)  Initial violation. Except as provided in sections (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section, if a violation of any city code, ordinance, or regulation is found, the code enforcement officer will give the violator a notice of violation (NOV) indicating the type of violation found and manner in which it may be corrected and providing a reasonable time in which to correct the violation. If the violation continues beyond the time provided on the notice for compliance, the code enforcement officer may request a hearing. The special magistrate will schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing will be provided to the violator as set forth in section 30-19 below. If the violation is corrected and then recurs, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code enforcement officer, the case may be presented to the special magistrate or a code enforcement board even if the violation has been corrected prior to such hearing, and the notice will so state. 
(c)  Repeat violation. If a repeat violation is found, the code enforcement officer will notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code enforcement officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, will request a hearing. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board shall schedule a hearing and provide notice as set forth in section 30-19. The case may be presented to the special magistrate or the code enforcement board even if the repeat violation is corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice will so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the special magistrate or the code enforcement board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the special magistrate or code enforcement board. 
(d)  Immediate hearing. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this article, if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement officer will make a reasonable effort to notify the alleged violator and request a hearing. The alleged violator will be served with notice of hearing. In addition, the special magistrate or code enforcement board will notify the city, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. The costs of such repairs will be borne by the owner and/or violator, as applicable. 
(e)  Transfer of subject property. If the owner of property that is subject to any enforcement proceeding before a special magistrate, code enforcement board or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading or notice, as applicable, was served and the time of the hearing, such owner must: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee; and 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor; and 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding; and 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement officer regarding the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within 5 days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) above before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding will not be dismissed, but the new owner will be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(f)  Procedure for intersection safety and/or traffic violations. See chapter 26, traffic, hearing before the special magistrate; chapter 26, parking, hearing before the special magistrate; chapter 18, police, hearing before the special magistrate; chapter 15, offenses, hearing before the special magistrate. 
(g)  No stay. A request for an interpretation from the manager, or any appeal of such interpretation to the city council, will not act to stay any enforcement proceeding under this code unless specifically ordered by the special magistrate or the code enforcement board. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-15. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Scheduling of hearings. A regular time and place will be designated for code enforcement proceedings and requests for hearing pursuant to city codes and standard building codes, before the special magistrate or a code enforcement board. The frequency of these hearings will be based upon the number of cases to be heard. A special hearing may take place on a day or at a time not regularly set aside for code enforcement proceedings, upon request of the code enforcement officer or at such other times as may be necessary. The code enforcement officer is responsible for scheduling code cases and the police department is responsible for scheduling chapter 26 - traffic, chapter 26 - parking, chapter 18 - police and chapter 15 - offenses, hearings, to be heard by the special magistrate. Minutes will be kept of all hearings. All hearings will be open to the public, but no public input will be taken. 
(b)  Prosecution of the case. Each case on the docket will be presented to the special magistrate by the code enforcement officer and/or the city attorney, if and when their legal services are deemed necessary, city manager or his/her designee. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate or a code enforcement board, it will be entitled to recover all costs, to include any attorney fees, incurred in prosecuting the case. Such costs may be included in the lien authorized under this code and under F.S. 162.07 and 162.09(3). For purposes of this section, the issuance of an order finding violation will be evidence that the city has prevailed in prosecuting the case. 
(c)  Hearing testimony. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board will proceed to hear the cases on the docket for that day. All testimony will be under oath and recorded. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board, will have the power to take testimony from appropriate city staff and the alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence will not apply, but fundamental due process will apply and will govern the proceedings. 
(d)  Special magistrate order or order of a code enforcement board. Within 15 days after the conclusion of each hearing, the special magistrate or a code enforcement board will issue findings of fact based on evidence of record and conclusions of law and will issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted under this code and Florida law. Such order may include a notice that the order must be complied with by a specific date and that a fine may be imposed. An award of the costs of prosecution due and owing to the city may also be imposed. The special magistrate or the code enforcement board has the discretion to grant additional time for abatement of the violation. The date for abatement will be set out in the written order. If the violation is of the type described in section 30-14 (d), the cost of repairs incurred by the town pursuant to section 30-14 (d) may be included along with the administrative fine and imposition of costs of prosecution if the order is not complied with by said date. 
(e)  Recording the order. A certified copy of the order may be recorded in the public records of Brevard County and will constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein are binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order has been recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection, and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate or a code enforcement board will issue an order acknowledging compliance that will be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue an order acknowledging compliance. Failure of a violator to pay the costs of prosecution assessed against him/her by the date specified in the order finding violation may also result in the recording of the order in the public records of Brevard County, and will constitute a lien on the subject property and all other properties of the violator. Nothing in this section will be construed to waive the violator's obligations under section 30-14(d) or other provisions of this Code. 
(f)  Recovery of cost. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate or a code enforcement board, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in said prosecution.

Sec. 30-16. - Powers of the special magistrate or a code enforcement board in code violation hearings. 
The special magistrate or a code enforcement board, has the power and authority to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of code enforcement hearings and hearings pursuant to city codes and standard building codes. 
(2)  To use where appropriate section 30-14 - enforcement procedure; section 30-15 - conduct of hearing; section 30-16A - enforcement; section 30-17 - administrative fines, costs and liens; section 30-18 - rehearing and appeals; and section 30-19 - notices.

(4)  Subpoena evidence to code violation hearings. 
(5)  Hold hearings.

(8)  Establish, levy, waive, reduce or alter fines pursuant to section 30-16A. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-16A. - Enforcement 
(a)  After an order to correct a violation has been issued and the date of compliance ordered by the special magistrate or a code enforcement board has passed, the code enforcement officer shall make an inspection to determine if the alleged violation has been corrected. 
(b)  The code enforcement officer shall then issue an affidavit of compliance or noncompliance, which shall be filed with the special magistrate or a code enforcement board. A copy of the affidavit shall be sent to the violator(s) in the same manner as provided for notices in section 30-19. 
(c)  If the violator(s) have not complied with the order of the special magistrate or a code enforcement board, the special magistrate or a code enforcement board shall be authorized to impose such penalties as provided in section 30-17. 
(d)  The special magistrate or a code enforcement board shall hold such additional hearing(s) as necessary to ensure compliance. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-17. - Administrative fines, costs, and liens. 
(a)  Order by special magistrate or a code enforcement board. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board, upon notification by the code enforcement officer that an order of the special magistrate or the code enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed. However, the special magistrate may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in section 30-29, classes of violations and associated civil penalties, for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate or the code enforcement board for compliance; or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code enforcement officer; or may order abatement. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 30-14 (d) above, the special magistrate or the code enforcement board will notify the city, which may take the actions set forth with specificity in section 30-14 (d). If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made by the special magistrate or the code enforcement board, as provided in this code, a hearing will not be necessary prior to issuance of an order imposing a fine. However, if a dispute arises as to whether the violator has complied, the special magistrate or the code enforcement board, may grant a request for hearing if the request is made by the violator in writing, setting forth the reasons for dispute, and received by the city special magistrate or code enforcement board no later than ten (10) days following the date specified in the order for compliance. If such hearing is held, testimony will be limited to the issue of compliance with the special magistrate's or code enforcement board's previous order and no new evidence as to whether a violation occurred will be allowed. If the violation is of the type described in section 30-14 (d), the special magistrate or code enforcement board may charge the violator with the cost of those repairs made by the city, along with the fine imposed under this section. 
(b)  Administrative fine. A fine imposed by the special magistrate or a code enforcement board, under this section shall not exceed the statutory limitations imposed by Chapter 162, Florida Statutes of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day, excepting the penalty provisions specified in chapter 30. 
(1)  The special magistrate or a code enforcement board may assess the cost of all repairs incurred by the city in accordance with subsection (a) of this section as an additional component of the fine as well as the costs of prosecuting the case before the special magistrate or the code enforcement board. For purposes of this article, prosecution costs include, but are not limited to, recording costs, inspection costs, time spent by the code enforcement officer(s), police officer(s) or other city staff at hearings, preparation costs, photography costs, attorney fees, and similar items. 
(2)  The following factors will be considered by the special magistrate or a code enforcement board in determining the amount of the fine or the amount of mitigation necessary, if any: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  The special magistrate or a code enforcement board may reduce the fine imposed under this section and is authorized to mitigate any such fine at a hearing specifically noticed for such purpose. 
(c)  Creation of a lien. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine or a fine plus repair costs, and/or assessing the costs of prosecution, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter will constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order will not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed under this article will continue to accrue until (i) the violator has complied with the order rendered by the special magistrate or a code enforcement board or until (ii) judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose the lien, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed under this section runs in favor of the City of Cocoa Beach, and the city manager may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered in accordance with this section. The city may foreclose on a lien, which remains unpaid for a period of three or more months after filing thereof or sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. No lien created under this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under section 4, article X, of the state constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section will not apply to real or personal property which is covered under section 4(a), article X, of the state constitution. 
(d)  Duration of lien. A lien established in accordance with the provisions of this article may not continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing the fine and/or assessing the costs of prosecution has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced as set forth in section 30-17 above, in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on the lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in the action. The city is entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of an action will not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(e)  Jurisdiction over lien. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board will retain jurisdiction over all cases in which a lien has been recorded until the lien has been released. Upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence by the violator, the special magistrate or code enforcement board has the authority to reduce the lien amount for pay-off purposes, in the following circumstances: 
a.  The violator has come into compliance, but due to circumstances beyond his or her control resulting in extreme financial hardship, the violator cannot pay the full amount necessary to satisfy and release the lien; or 
b.  The violator has not come into compliance, but has a contract to sell the property, contingent upon release of the lien, to a contract purchaser who intends to bring the property into compliance, provided, however, that the contract-purchaser must first enter into an agreement with the city, indicating his intent to bring the property into compliance and a timetable for completing the work, and establishing security for performance. The authority to reduce fines granted to the special magistrate or a code enforcement board will be applicable to all code enforcement cases in which a lien has been placed on the property and remains unsatisfied. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-18. - Request for rehearing and appeals. 
(a)  Either the city or the violator may request a rehearing of the decision of the special magistrate or of a code enforcement board. A request for rehearing will be made, in writing, and will be filed with the city clerk within ten business days of the execution of the order. A request for rehearing will be based only on the grounds that the decision was contrary to the evidence or that the hearing involved an error on a ruling of law that was fundamental to the decision of the special magistrate or the code enforcement board. The written request for rehearing will specify the precise reasons therefore. The special magistrate or a code enforcement board will make a determination as to whether or not to rehear the matter and the decision will be made at a public hearing. If the special magistrate or the code enforcement board determines that a rehearing will be granted, pursuant to same the following may occur: 
(1)  Schedule a hearing where the parties will be given the opportunity to present evidence or argument limited to the specific reasons for which the rehearing was granted; or 
(2)  Modify or reverse the prior order, without receiving further evidence, providing the change is based on a finding that the prior decision of the special magistrate or code enforcement board resulted from a ruling on a question of law which the special magistrate or code enforcement board has been informed was an erroneous ruling. 
Until a request for rehearing has been denied or otherwise disposed of, the order of the special magistrate or code enforcement board will be stayed and the time for taking an appeal, pursuant to this section, will not commence to run until the date upon which the special magistrate or code enforcement board has finally disposed of the request for rehearing by denying the same, or otherwise. 
(b)  An aggrieved party, including the city commission, may appeal a final order of the special magistrate or the code enforcement board to the circuit court. Such an appeal will be limited to appellate review of the record created before the special magistrate or the code enforcement board and will not be a hearing de novo. An appeal must be filed within 30 days of the special magistrate's or code enforcement board's execution of the order being appealed. A copy of the notice of appeal must be provided to the special magistrate or code enforcement board and the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-19. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required by this article will be provided to the alleged violator by (i) first class mail, subject to the provisions of section 30-19 (b) below; or (ii) by hand delivery by the city police department or other law enforcement officer, code enforcement officer, or other person designated by the city manager; or (iii) by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or (iv) in the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  If notice is sent via first class mail to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the Brevard County Tax Collector's Office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the city by such owner, and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting at city hall described in subsections (c)(1) and (2) below and by first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the city, with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing. 
(c)  In addition to provision of notice as set forth in subsection (a), notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice will be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a Brevard County newspaper of general circulation. The newspaper must meet the requirements prescribed under F.S. Chapter 50 for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication must be made in accordance with F.S. section 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (1), such notice may be posted for at least ten days prior to the hearing or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which must be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other must be at city hall for the City of Cocoa Beach. Proof of posting must be by affidavit of the person posting the notice. The affidavit must include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) above. 
(d)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsections (a) and (b), together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (c), will be sufficient to show the notice requirements of this article have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-20. - Supplemental code enforcement. 
The provisions of this section are an additional and supplemental means of enforcing city codes and ordinances and may be used for the enforcement of any code or ordinance, or for the enforcement of all codes and ordinances. Nothing in this section prohibits the city from enforcing its codes or ordinances by any other means. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)  
Sec. 30-21. - Conflict. 
In the event that any provision in this article is found to be contrary to any other existing city code or ordinances covering the same subject matter, the more restrictive will apply. In the event that any provision in this article is in conflict with the procedures found in F.S. Chapter 162, the provisions of the statute will prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
(Ord. No. 1583, § 3, 10-2-2014)

(Ord. No. 1616, § 2(Exh. A), 2-1-2018) 
Section 1-13. - Relationship to Comprehensive Plan. 
A.  Generally. All LDC regulations are to be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the requirements of F.S. § 163.3194(1)(b). Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan means that the land use, densities and intensities, and other aspects of development that are permitted, are consistent with and further the goals, objectives, and policies detailed in the Comprehensive Plan. Additional regulations detailed in this Land Development Code (LDC) are intended to provide a tangible means to achieve the goals, objectives, and policies stated in each section or element of the Comprehensive Plan. Nothing in these LDC regulations shall be construed to authorize development inconsistent with the adopted City of Cocoa Beach Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  General findings. 
1.  Statutory requirement. F.S. §§ 163.3201 and 163.3202 requires each Florida local government to enact LDC regulations that are consistent with the local adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  General public need. Controlling the location, design and construction of development within the city is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life, as better defined in this section. 
C.  Specific findings. With regard to the following specific subject areas of these LDC regulations, the city commission finds: 
1.  Administration and enforcement. 
a.  A single set of administrative procedures for making all land use decisions promotes efficiency, predictability and citizen participation. 
b.  All developments will file an application in order to participate in a development review process to assure compliance with the requirements of these LDC regulations. 
c.  All stand-alone developments and redevelopments and additions to commercial structures, which includes residential developments larger than a duplex, regardless of size, will undergo a pre-application review by the development review committee (DRC), which is comprised of city staff and any outside agencies with joint jurisdiction over the development. This review enhances communications and establishes an understanding of the development between the city and the applicant in regards to applicable city codes thereby improving the efficiency of the development review process. This pre-application review also allows the development to be modified as needed prior to formal submittal, and to comply with all city codes. 
d.  Buildings larger than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet and or site plans larger than three (3) acres, or both, shall require review and approval from the planning board and city commission. Buildings smaller than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet and or site plans smaller than three (3) acres, or both, only require administrative review and approval by the DRC. 
e.  Upon formal submittal of the development, the development review committee will convene and provide their review comments in written format to the applicant within ten (10) business days of submittal. 
f.  A quick, efficient and non-political avenue of appeal should be available for all ministerial and administrative decisions. This appeal process is outlined in detail in article IX, section 1-49 of this LDC. 
g.  Enforcement of building/development permits and the provisions of these regulations should be through procedures that are efficient, effective and consistent with the code enforcement procedures established by state law and as outlined in chapter 30 of the City Code of Ordinances. 
2.  Signs. 
a.  Recognizing that signs are necessary in the city and that they play an important role in the success of the city's commercial enterprises, they should also be made to have a beneficial impact on the character, aesthetics, and quality of life in the city as well as the economy. 
b.  Sign regulations are contained in chapter V of these Land Development Codes. 
3.  Landscaping and tree protection. 
a.  Landscaping and buffering development with trees and other vegetation improves the aesthetics and promotes the health, safety and welfare of the community and, as such, warrants the promulgation and enforcement of landscape requirements. 
b.  Landscaping regulations are contained in chapter III of these Land Development Codes. 
4.  Off-street parking and loading of vehicles. 
a.  Off-street parking and loading of vehicles promotes the public health, safety and welfare by reducing traffic congestion on local streets and highways. 
b.  Off-street parking regulations are contained in chapter III of these LDC regulations. 
5.  Stormwater management. 
a.  Proper stormwater management and treatment is necessary within all developments of the city to further increase the public health, safety and welfare. 
b.  Stormwater planning, treatment, development and management regulations are contained in the City of Cocoa Beach Stormwater Master Plan, which is upheld and enforced by the city stormwater department.

Section 2-01. - Intent. 
    To accomplish the aims and purposes of these Land Development Code (LDC) regulations, the city is divided into zoning districts of such common unity of purpose which are deemed to have harmonious activities and operations. To further meet these purposes, the design and development regulations for each zoning district are specifically defined herein. 
Section 2-02. - Rules for interpretation of zoning district boundaries and permitted uses. 
    Where uncertainty exists in regard to the boundaries of any zoning district or the permitted, special exception or prohibited uses, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  Where boundaries are shown as following street, alley or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundaries. 
B.  In un-subdivided property, where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of the boundary, if not specified with dimensions, shall be determined by the scale shown on the official zoning map. 
C.  Boundaries indicated as following the shoreline and/or mean-high water line shall be construed as such, and should either water line change, the boundary line shall change accordingly. 
D.  Where any street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the abutting property and/or boundary line shall be adjusted to the newly adjusted boundary line. 
E.  Distances or dimensions not specially indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by using the scale shown on the map. 
F.  Annexed territory shall be classified in accordance with state requirements until otherwise changed by ordinance as provided herein, unless such property has a preliminary zoning district designation in the Comp Plan, then such property may be annexed with said zoning designation. 
G.  Where physical features existing on the ground vary from those shown on the official zoning map, or when other circumstances not covered by subsections A. through F. above exist, the administrator shall make the final determination on the boundaries. 
H.  Uses not specifically listed as a permitted use or a special exception are deemed to be prohibited. 
I.  Gambling shall be deemed a specifically prohibited use. The purchase of Florida Lottery related products and non-profit organization raffle tickets are excluded and not deemed a specifically prohibited use. See definition for "gambling" in chapter I, section 1-20.

    The official zoning map or any amendments thereto, shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the official zoning map of the City of Cocoa Beach, Florida." 
    If changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such map changes shall be made promptly thereafter, together with an entry which provides the following:

No changes shall be made to the official zoning map except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this article. Unauthorized changes by any person(s) shall be considered a violation of these regulations and punishable as provided under City Code chapter 31. 
    Only the zoning map located in the office of the city manager or his designee shall be deemed as the official zoning map for the city. 
Section 2-04. - Replacement of official zoning map. 
    Should the official zoning map become damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret due to the nature and/or number of changes and additions made to it, the city commission may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map to replace the previous map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting, written or other errors or omissions in the previous map, but no such correction(s) shall have the effect of amending the previous map or any subsequent amendment thereof.

Section 2-23. - Professional-commercial opportunity overlay district. 
A.  Scope. The regulations contained within this section shall apply to the properties designated on the overlay map. These properties have an underlying zoning of RM-2 multifamily-professional. This district is consistent with the high density residential and professional and high density residential and tourist categories as designated on the future land use map contained within the Future Land Use Element of the City of Cocoa Beach Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Purpose. In the City of Cocoa Beach, overlay districts have been incorporated to further specify and define development standards, provisions, and regulations for certain geographic areas where further specificity is required to more accurately facilitate development based upon area specific needs and goals wherein these needs and goals do not apply to the zoning category citywide. This overlay district provides more flexibility to the applicant relative to what types of uses are permitted in the overlay district as opposed to requiring the applicant to strictly comply with the more widely accepted city-wide uses permitted by the underlying zoning category. Development in this overly district is expected to benefit from frontage on or proximity to the SR A1A corridor while recognizing the necessity of protecting the adjacent residentially zoned properties. 
C.  Permitted principal uses and structures. In addition to those permitted within the RM-2 zoning district, the following uses and structures are permitted. 
1.  Multifamily dwellings.

1.  Are clearly ancillary and accessory to the principal use. 
2.  The following accessory uses, when clearly subordinate to a transient lodging or multifamily complex of fifty (50) or more dwelling units, or an office building, are permitted provided they are located within the structure and together do not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross floor area of the structure: 
a.  Bar and lounges. 
b.  Travel and car rental agencies. 
3.  Offices with laboratories provided no manufacturing is conducted. 
4.  Home occupations are permitted in accordance with section 3-76 of these regulations. 
5.  Any uses claimed as accessory which exceed the allowances of subsection D.2 above shall not be considered accessory uses and must meet all district requirements applied to principal uses and structures. As a principal use, the land area utilized for such purposes cannot be credited toward density allowances except as provided in subsection J.3 below. 
E.  Special exceptions. After public notice and hearing and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, as provided in chapter IV article V, the board of adjustment may permit the following as special exceptions: 
1.  Community residential homes, levels II and III.

Sections 2-24, 2-25. - Reserved. 
Section 2-26. - Special development overlay district (SDOD). 
A.  Scope. Since it is typically impossible to find flexibility in traditional pre-existing zoning district regulations, the SDOD is a means of applying flexible land use controls and land regulations which promotes a more efficient development of a parcel or parcels of land without disturbing the underlying land uses and zoning classifications in a specific zoning district or area. 
    To permit more flexible land use regulations and facilitate the most advantageous methods of land development, it is often necessary to establish conditional or alternate uses and development requirements that apply to different zoning districts. Through the creation of an SDOD, these uses are encouraged as alternatives to traditional land uses typically permitted within each zoning district, and the following regulations shall apply to the zoning of all SDODs. 
B.  Purpose and intent. The SDOD requires a development agreement be created between the applicant and the city before an SDOD can become effective. The SDOD incorporates a more flexible means to negotiate and coordinate the private sector's objectives, which may vary from traditional zoning district requirements, while also being in line with the public sector's neighborhood and community preservation objectives which seek to preserve existing neighborhood patterns of design. Specifically, the purpose and intent of an SDOD is to: 
1.  Achieve higher quality urban design amenities, which serve to encourage redevelopment and infill of land to improve property values. 
2.  Promote efficiency through more cost effective, flexible and creative regulations to reverse neighborhood decline and upgrade housing quality. 
3.  Stimulate mixed uses not possible through conventional zoning district regulations. 
4.  Preserve architectural qualities of the community where they are important to attract and create new development that is compatible with existing neighborhoods and commercial areas. 
5.  Promote and implement sustainable development practices and design including, but not limited to, application of leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) green building standards and construction for structures built within a SDOD. 
    Although the SDOD provides opportunities for unique concepts, it shall blend with the existing neighborhood character and comply with the underlying zoning district regulations as well as the specific regulations established in this section. 
C.  Minimum size. An SDOD shall have no minimum size requirement. 
D.  Compliance with subdivision regulations. All SDOD applications shall be reviewed pursuant to the provisions of this section and they shall also comply with and be submitted in accordance with the provisions of chapter IV, article I, "site plan," and/or article II, "subdivision procedure." 
E.  Permitted uses and compliance with Comp Plan. The uses and density permitted in an SDOD district shall be consistent with and conform to the underlying zoning district regulations as further defined in this chapter. 
F.  Size and dimension regulations. 
1.  All SDODs shall provide sufficient access and area for effective delivery of emergency services. 
2.  Deviations from the development standards described in this section or for the underlying zoning district may require variance or special exception approval from the board of adjustment, as determined by the administrator. 
3.  In reviewing SDOD development plans, the specific residential density approved by the city shall: be consistent with the City Charter, Comp Plan, and the underlying zoning district requirements where the SDOD is located, to ensure cohesiveness with the surrounding neighborhoods and area; protect environmentally sensitive areas; and, minimize any flood hazard impacts on surrounding properties. 
4.  The city reserves the right to mandate changes in the site plan if it is found to not satisfy the provisions of the City Charter, Comp Plan and these regulations. 
5.  Frontage and accessibility. Every SDOD must have improved access to a public street, as required by the city engineering design standards. Flag lots shall not be permitted with the rezoning to an SDOD. 
6.  Lot size. No more than twenty (20) percent of the total number of lots in an SDOD can be less than four thousand five hundred (4,500) square feet unless fifty (50) percent of the total developable area for residential is dedicated as open space. 
7.  Setbacks. The development plan shall provide detailed information on any required setbacks within the SDOD and no minimum setbacks are required except for the perimeter boundary setbacks in the case of multi-unit, multi-use developments. However, the city may mandate minimum setbacks during the site plan review which are consistent with sound planning principles and practices. 
8.  Height/density. The height and density of structures shall be consistent with the underlying zoning district where the SDOD is located, as provided for in the Comp Plan. 
9.  Building configuration and open space. The location of structures, open space, landscaping, and pedestrian and vehicular circulation shall provide a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment consistent with the underlying zoning district requirements and Comp Plan. 
10.  Natural systems. Dunes and other natural systems which exist shall be preserved and incorporated into the site plan. 
11.  Land uses, general. All proposed land uses in the SDOD shall be designated on the development plan, consistent with the underlying zoning district land uses, and oriented with consideration of existing and proposed land uses. Appropriate buffering shall be located between incompatible land uses on adjacent properties and within the SDOD. If land uses not consistent with the underlying zoning district are requested, the applicant shall be required to seek an amendment to the future land use map. 
G.  Commercial and office. 
1.  SDODs with commercial and office land uses must locate on an arterial or collector street, or a service road connected thereto. Mixed-use professional office and residential structures may locate on local streets. Commercial and office land uses may locate on local streets in residential areas where permitted by these regulations and the Comp Plan when they are designed to only serve the retail and service needs of the surrounding neighborhood, and not the community at large; and, create and maintain street impacts which resemble characteristics of a residential neighborhood which discourages access to and through the neighborhood by large commercial trucks and heavy volumes of vehicular traffic. 
2.  Prevention of strip development. Commercial and office land uses shall be integrated with other land uses and designed in such a way that prevents strip development. 
H.  Signs. The SDOD shall have provisions for sign design and regulations that can be enforced by both the city and a property owners association which minimizes sign proliferation, promotes architectural integrity, provides an overall harmony in the color, theme, and design of all signage, and complies with the sign regulations within this code in chapter V. The applicant shall submit a uniform master sign plan, in accordance with chapter V, article II, section 5-24 of these codes, which establishes the type, height, number, size, design and location of all signs in the SDOD. 
I.  Development plan requirements. In addition to requirements of article I and article II of chapter III of these regulations, and to promote a harmonious and aesthetic environment for pedestrians and other user groups within the proposed development, the following shall also be incorporated into the SDOD development plans: 
1.  A drainage system approved by the city engineer. The city engineer shall review and approve the drainage system(s) submitted which are deemed by the engineer to be the most appropriate for the surface water drainage and management. 
2.  Water and sewer. SDODs shall locate within a central water and sewer service area, or where such systems are not yet available, such utilities must be made available as outlined in the development agreement. Any interim sewer services provided for residential land uses shall be consistent with provisions of the Comp Plan. No interim water and sewer services shall be allowed for commercial land uses, unless a development agreement specifies a time when such central services will be made available. 
3.  Sidewalks and improvements to enhance pedestrian movement. Sidewalks shall be installed on one (1) side of all streets in accordance with Comp Plan Map 10, "Sidewalk/ Bike Path Master Plan," and chapter III, article VI, section 3-31. 
4.  Traffic circulation improvements. A traffic analysis shall be submitted to the city engineer for review and approval for all SDODs, where he/she will make the determination on what, if any, traffic circulation improvements shall be included in the SDOD. 
5.  Lighting. Street lighting, which is harmonious with the urban design theme of the city, shall be incorporated in the SDOD development. Street lighting shall be installed on all perimeter streets, within parking areas, and along pedestrian walkways. 
6.  Open space and landscape furniture. Open spaces and landscape furniture proposed for the SDOD shall promote the project's urban design and aesthetics and address the landscape design standards of chapter IV or show why the SDOD design is better. 
7.  Other subdivision or site improvements. All other subdivision or site improvements and project amenities shall be consistent with a unified urban design as prescribed by the city. All utility lines shall be placed underground. High voltage electrical lines may be placed underground or on concrete poles placed within the street right-of-way which have provisions for street lighting. Large transformers shall be placed on the ground on pad mounts which are screened from view by landscaping or in enclosures or vaults which are compatible with the primary building design. 
8.  Storage areas. All storage areas shall be fully enclosed and located at the rear of all structures. No inoperative motor vehicle shall be stored or used for storage within any SDOD unless it is within a completely enclosed building. 
J.  Submittal requirements and review procedure for special development overlay districts. 
1.  General. The application and review procedures for rezoning to an SDOD designation are located in article VII of chapter IV of these regulations. All SDOD applications shall require a public hearing process as required for a rezoning and shall be referenced on the official zoning map, once approved. 
2.  Planning board review. 
a.  The applicant must provide eight (8) copies of the completed application and a development plan which describes the basic ideas of the project for planning board discussion. The staff must provide this pre-zoning application at the next available planning board meeting. 
b.  A completed rezoning application for an SDOD must be filed a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the planning board meeting where the SDOD will be reviewed. The planning board may discuss the zoning and development plan in a public meeting, but one (1) public hearing is required. 
3.  City commission action. This rezoning action requires one (1) public hearing before the city commission for approval.

ARTICLE V. - ESTABLISHMENT OF REDEVELOPMENT ZONING DISTRICT AND SUBDISTRICTS 

Section 2-30. - Purpose of redevelopment zoning. 
    Within the City of Cocoa Beach the redevelopment zoning districts have been created to achieve these ends: 
•  Provide areas where the city can accommodate defined growth and redevelopment, while protecting the residential districts of the city. 
•  Provide a variety of activities in walkable settings to meet the daily needs of residents, visitors, workers, and businesses. 
•  Enhance the interconnected network of pedestrian and bicycle friendly streets that link beaches, sidewalks, bike routes, transit stops, parks, and buildings. 
•  Accommodate redevelopment at a range of scales including expansions to existing buildings and new small to medium-sized infill buildings. 
•  Implement the Downtown Vision Plan and the Gateways Master Plan. 
•  Support the efforts of the community redevelopment agency and local economic development and redevelopment agencies. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-31. - Redevelopment district boundaries. 
    There have been identified four (4) redevelopment zoning districts within Cocoa Beach, the boundaries of which are described below: 
A.  Downtown. The downtown redevelopment district is generally located in the areas between Cocoa Isles Boulevard to the north and Ramp Road to the south. The district includes those properties on both sides of A1A between Cocoa Isles Boulevard and Fourth Street North; those properties between the ocean beach and midblock between Catalina Avenue and Woodland Avenue between Fourth Street North and First Street North; those properties east of Azalea Drive and the ocean beach between First Street North and Minutemen Causeway; those properties on both sides of Atlantic Avenue South and Orlando Avenue South between Minutemen Causeway and First Street South; those properties west of Atlantic Avenue South and east of Brevard Avenue South between First Street South and Fifth Street South; and those parcels west of Brevard Avenue South, north of Ramp Road, and south of Fourth Street South. The specific boundaries are illustrated on the map located in Figure 2-32A. 
B.  Midtown. The midtown redevelopment district is generally located on the east side of Atlantic Avenue North. Included in the district are Lori Wilson Park, properties on the south side of the park to a point generally across from Maritime Hammock and properties to the north of the park to a point generally across from Bahama Boulevard and Jamaica Drive. The specific boundaries are illustrated on the map located in Figure 2-32B. 
C.  Uptown. The uptown redevelopment district is generally located at the intersection of SR 520 and SR A1A. Included in the district are the properties along the east side of SR A1A with the south boundary inclusive of both sides of Surf Drive and those parcels directly south of Surf Drive and across from Manatee Lane, Volusia Lane East to the north, and the ocean beach on the east; the properties on the north side of SR 520 west of SR A1A, east of the Banana River, with the north boundary being the canal south of Angelo Lane and those properties on the north and south sides of Columbia Lane West; and those properties south of SR 520 between the Banana River and SR A1A, extending south to include those properties between South Banana River Boulevard and SR A1A surrounding Canaveral Plaza Boulevard to include those properties fronting SR A1A south to Escambia Lane. The specific boundaries are illustrated on the map located in Figure 2-32C. 
D.  North Cocoa Beach. The north Cocoa Beach redevelopment district is generally at the north end of the city limits. Included are the properties north of California Avenue between Palm Avenue and SR A1A; the properties on the north side of Shepard Drive South to about 600 feet west of SR A1A, on the south side of Shepard Drive South to about 700 feet west of SR A1A, including the Cornerstone Plaza; and the properties on the east side of SR A1A from Pulsipher Avenue to Harding Avenue to the ocean beach. The specific boundaries are illustrated on the map located in Figure 2-32D. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-32. - Subdistricts. 
    Each property within the redevelopment zoning district is assigned to a subdistrict that provides suitable regulations for the characteristics and location of that land. Subdistricts are illustrated in Figures 2-32A through D for the downtown, midtown, uptown, and north Cocoa Beach areas. 
A.  The town center subdistrict is a mixed use, pedestrian oriented hub for surrounding neighborhoods and the entire city. This is the downtown center for dining, shopping, housing, and entertainment, with shaded sidewalks, large windows, intimate pedestrian spaces, outdoor dining, and richly detailed building facades. This subdistrict supports a variety of special events and public gathering activities. 
B.  The gateway subdistrict offers opportunities to upgrade existing commercial districts into destination showcases with a wide variety of pedestrian-oriented, mixed use developments and open spaces. Vacant and underdeveloped sites provide possibilities for larger, planned use developments. 
C.  The oceanside subdistrict contains multifamily housing, hotels and amenities, which are closely linked to public spaces like parks, shopping, and the ocean. The intent is to provide a walkable beach-oriented experience for residents and visitors. East/west streets allow public access to main thoroughfares and the beaches, and the area encourages mixed use development. 
D.  The cottage row subdistrict is primarily residential with a wide variety of housing types. New and renovated buildings tuck parking between, behind, and under buildings to maintain a strongly pedestrian character. This area is intended to maintain its residential character and should be preserved as one (1) of the primary destinations for downtown living. 
E.  The civic subdistrict provides locations for civic uses within the community, such as schools, post offices, religious institutions, community centers and parks. The uses allowed are generally considered to be compatible with the residential neighborhoods that surround this subdistrict.

(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-33. - Permitted uses within the redevelopment district. 
    Table 2-33 identifies uses that are permitted in each subdistrict, organized into residential, business, and civic/education categories. Table 2-33 applies to existing buildings as well as new and expanded buildings. 
A.  Uses identified with a "P" are principal uses that are permitted by right. 
B.  Uses identified with an "SE" may be permitted by approval of a special exception, per the requirements within chapter IV. 
C.  Uses which are not identified in Table 2-33 are not permitted within that subdistrict. 
D.  Definitions are listed in section 1-20. 
E.  Any uses which do not fit specifically into one (1) or more category will be subject to the determination of the administrator as to whether the particular proposed use is permitted, permitted upon special exception approval, or not permitted. 
F.  Accessory uses and structures within the redevelopment district are permitted where they are customarily ancillary and clearly incidental and subordinate to existing principal uses. Accessory structures and uses must be in compliance with the criteria in chapter III and must meet the setback requirements of the principal structure. Cottage row and civic subdistricts are considered residential, and all other subdistricts are considered commercial.

Section 2-34. - Accessory dwellings. 
A.  An accessory dwelling is a single permanent dwelling unit on the same lot as another use permitted in the subdistrict. 
B.  Accessory dwellings are permitted in certain subdistricts either by right or by special exception. 
C.  An accessory dwelling can be in the same building as the other use on the lot or in a separate building, provided the structure complies with all setback and lot coverage requirements. 
D.  Only one (1) accessory dwelling may be constructed on a lot. 
E.  The size of an accessory dwelling may be up to thirty-five (35) percent of the air conditioned space of the principal structure, to a maximum size of eight hundred (800) square feet. 
F.  An accessory dwelling that is attached must comply with the setback and building requirements for the principal structure. 
G.  An accessory dwelling that is detached in a new or expanded building must comply with the requirements for an outbuilding, described in Figure 2-42I. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-35. - Live/work units. 
    A live/work unit is a single dwelling unit in a detached building, or in a multifamily or mixed-use building, that also accommodates limited commercial uses within the dwelling unit. The use of a live/work unit is predominately residential; commercial activities are secondary. The quiet enjoyment of residential neighbors takes precedence over the work needs of a live/work unit. 
A.  Live/work units are permitted in certain subdistricts either by right or by special exception. 
B.  Commercial uses in live/work units are limited to offices, limited and to store and services, limited, as those terms are defined by this code. 
C.  Commercial uses in live/work units must be conducted entirely within the unit or a customary residential accessory structure. 
D.  No more than two (2) employees or contractors other than family members residing in the dwelling may work in a live/work unit. 
E.  Signage for live/work units is limited to one (1) non-illuminated wall or window sign up to three (3) square feet. 
F.  Products and equipment must not be visible from the street and may not be stored outdoors. 
G.  No equipment may create noise, vibration, glare, fumes, or odors outside the dwelling unit that are objectionable to the normal senses. 
H.  Where live/work dwelling units require a special exception, the approval may specify an annual review process that could result in revocation if these requirements and any other conditions of approval are not maintained. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-36. - Work/live units. 
    A work/live unit is a single dwelling unit in a detached building, or in a multifamily, mixed-use, or commercial building, where the predominate use of the unit is commercial. Because the predominate use of a work/live unit is commercial, customary commercial impacts may take precedence over the quiet enjoyment expectations of residential neighbors. 
A.  Work/live units are permitted in certain subdistricts either by right or by special exception. 
B.  Commercial uses in work/live units are limited to offices, general and to store and services, general, as those terms are defined by this code. 
C.  Commercial uses in work/live units must be conducted entirely within the unit or a customary accessory structure. 
D.  Signage for work/live units is limited to either one (1) non-illuminated wall or window sign up to three (3) square feet or to a shingle sign no greater than two (2) square feet and is installed such that the bottom of the sign is at least eight (8) feet above the walking surface. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-37. - Dimensional regulations for existing buildings. 
    Table 2-37 provides dimensional regulations that apply to existing buildings in each subdistrict. These regulations also apply when minor changes are being proposed to existing buildings, such as changes of use, addition of accessory buildings, and minor expansions up to thirty (30) percent of the gross floor area or less than fifty (50) percent of the total assessed value of the structure. All owners have the option of choosing to be regulated by the standards for new and expanded buildings, but any changes or reconfiguration of fuel pumps, drive-through lanes or lot dimensions are required to be in compliance with the requirements for new and expanded buildings.

1. The rear setback for all oceanfront coastal properties is determined by the Florida DEP coastal construction control line. 
2. The absolute height is restricted to a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet when abutting properties within the RS-1 zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-38. - Dimensional regulations for new and expanded buildings. 
    When existing buildings are expanded more than thirty (30) percent of their gross floor area or improved more than fifty (50) percent of the total assessed value, the improved structure must meet the requirements for new and expanded buildings. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-39. - Building types generally. 
    Each new building constructed within a redevelopment zoning district must meet the standards for one (1) or more of the building types described in section 2-42. Section 2-41 identifies the architectural standards for structures and section 2-42 provides illustrative examples for each building type and placement on the lot. The building types are further summarized in Table 2-43. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-40. - Allowable building types described. 
A.  A shopfront building has ground-floor space immediately adjoining the sidewalk that can accommodate business uses with doors and large windows facing the sidewalk. 
B.  A mixed-use building has multiple tenants or occupancies and may contain residences, lodging and/or businesses to the extent allowed in the subdistrict. Shopfronts are permitted in mixed-use buildings but are not required. 
C.  A courtyard building accommodates multiple dwellings or businesses arranged around and fronting on a central garden or courtyard that may be partially or wholly open to the street. 
D.  A townhouse is a building with common walls on both sides and a private garden to the rear. Service and parking access is from the rear.

G.  A parking garage is a specialized building to park vehicles, with screening to conceal parked vehicles. 
H.  A civic building is a specialized building for public or civic uses such as schools, places of worship, or government functions. 
I.  An outbuilding is an additional building on a lot, such as a detached garage, workshop or accessory dwelling. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-41. - Building architectural guidelines. 
    Intent. The City of Cocoa Beach is seeking to create, through the use of a form-based code in the redevelopment subdistricts, architectural forms that add texture and composition to the streets and to these subdistricts. Architecture derives much of its aesthetics from its structural system which guides the placement of door and window openings and other design elements. Buildings must be sized appropriately for their context and should help to form well-proportioned public spaces. 
A.  Building footprint and proportion. Both new developments and redevelopment, must consider the building footprint and proportions of adjacent structures and neighborhood context. 
1.  The arrangement of openings on building facades must be organized in a rational manner typically aligned both vertically and horizontally. 
2.  Frequent building entries must be provided. These entries would ideally be functional but may be faux if circumstances of structure and function preclude an operable entry. Long building facades or storefronts must have multiple openings to preserve the small scale and character of Cocoa Beach. 
3.  When new development or redevelopment is adjacent to existing single family residences, the setback requirements provided within the RS-1 zoning district shall apply. 
B.  Varying height and volume. Nothing in this code section is intended to change the building height or density restrictions contained in the City of Cocoa Beach Charter. 
1.  Mixed-use developments and larger single-use buildings shall avoid creation of a large, dominant building mass by varying height and volumes in multi-story buildings. 
2.  Varying roof heights and façade treatments and color can create a better scale of the buildings to the street or other public realm. 
C.  Building articulation, architectural and façade treatment. The city's objective is to encourage the use of innovative and varied architectural designs, which are inspired by vernacular styles of Cocoa Beach, to enhance the sidewalk and encourage people to walk throughout the subdistricts. 
1.  Designs for the street levels of buildings - the ground level that meets the sidewalk - must consider the use of a variety of element such as active storefronts, visually appealing window displays, comfortable and attractive café seating, and artwork to attract people and encourage more walking. 
2.  Building facades, whether simple or complex and where their location is proximate to pedestrian traffic, must be designed to appeal to pedestrians to promote social interaction and increase foot traffic. 
3.  New buildings must consider their subdistrict's historic/vernacular architecture. 
4.  Building renovations should reveal and preserve original facades which may have been covered with false facades. 
5.  Long and uninterrupted facades that do not match the subdistrict's existing building footprints are to be avoided. 
6.  Plain or long building facades must utilize architectural treatments to create buildings and streetscapes that are visually appealing. 
7.  To achieve this character, apply at least two (2) of the following suggested architectural treatments to buildings facades: 
a.  A variety of building volumes; 
b.  Repeated similar materials and construction assemblies', common elements and architectural details; 
c.  Vertical and horizontal projections greater than four (4) inches in height, width, or depth; 
d.  Architectural screens, meshes, louvers, and glass; 
e.  Vegetated surfaces and planters; 
f.  Murals; 
g.  Sculptural screen; 
h.  Signage, graphics, and architectural lighting; 
i.  Art and artistic motifs that visually reflect the creative character of the community. 
D.  Building projections and shading of pedestrian areas. Temporary structural shading like awnings and fixed structural shading like canopies, concrete eyebrows, and colonnades improve a building's energy efficiency, protect pedestrians from the sun and rain, and create more comfortable sidewalk and pedestrian spaces. These structures also create a richer and more detailed building façade and assist in differentiating uses and spaces within the building, thereby providing a more unique and interesting pedestrian experience. Shading devices should be incorporated into new buildings and building renovations whenever possible. 
1.  Canopies, awnings, overhangs, porches, stoops, and other vertical projections must have a minimum clearance of eight (8) feet from the lowest portion of the assembly area or sidewalk elevation, whichever produces the most clearance distance. 
2.  Canopies, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  First floor canopy minimum depth is six (6) feet (measured perpendicular to the wall face). 
b.  Canopies above the first floor are not permitted except and unless they are covering a recessed terrace and thus behind the main plane of the building's façade. 
c.  Canopies may encroach over the sidewalk up to five (5) feet in depth, but shall not extend closer than two (2) feet to any curb line. Exceptions to the encroachment depth may be considered by the Administrator (if less than ten (10) percent) or the Board of Adjustment if site conditions warrant a larger encroachment. 
d.  Canopies must be constructed of durable materials like concrete or metal, to reinforce the architecture. 
e.  Canopies may be either supported from below by brackets or from above by suspension cables or chains. 
3.  Awnings, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  Awnings should frame storefronts and windows to highlight them from the street, provide weather protection from sun and rain, and reinforce a building's architecture. 
b.  Ground floor awnings must have a minimum depth of four (4) feet, measured perpendicular from the wall face. 
c.  Architectural and historic details of the building should be highlighted by awnings and should not be obscured by them. 
d.  Awnings should be made of commercial grade canvas and can be either fixed or retractable. 
e.  Plasticized and/or vinyl fabrics are prohibited. 
f.  Awnings shall not be illuminated from underneath or from behind to compete with other signage. 
g.  Awnings colors and styles may vary depending on the storefront, the architectural style, and the color(s) of the building. 
h.  Awnings may have lettering and be used as a secondary sign for businesses. Awnings cannot be used to advertise off-site businesses. 
i.  Awnings may encroach over the sidewalk up to five (5) feet in depth, but shall not extend closer than two (2) feet to any curb line. Exceptions to the encroachment depth may be considered by the Administrator (if less than ten (10) percent) or the Board of Adjustment if site conditions warrant a larger encroachment. 
j.  Awnings should maintain a minimum six (6) inch clearance from second floor features such as windows. 
4.  Balconies, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  Balconies (except for Juliet Balconies) must have a minimum depth of three (3) feet but can be larger to accommodate items such as a small seating area. 
b.  Balconies must have an underside clearance of at least nine (9) feet from the sidewalk. 
c.  Balconies may project beyond the required setback line, but may not extend beyond the lot line. 
d.  Balconies may have roofs, but still must be open, non-air-conditioned parts of the building. 
e.  All balconies should be supported by visual architectural elements such as decorative beams and/or brackets below or cables from above. Hidden internal structural support is an option if the building architecture is complementary with such structure. 
f.  On corners, balconies are encouraged to wrap around the side of the building. 
5.  Colonnades, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  Colonnade height should generally align with the ground floor building height and maintain a minimum underside clearance of nine (9) feet. 
b.  Colonnades should be at least eight (8) feet deep to accommodate space for seating, circulation, and door swing. They should have a consistent depth that matches those of neighboring building colonnades or arcades. Changes in the plain of the building façade may allow for some parts of the colonnade to be deeper that others while maintaining a consistent, parallel location to the sidewalk. 
c.  A clear, unobstructed walking path must be maintained on the sidewalk. 
d.  Galleries above colonnades should be only one (1) or two (2) stories in height and have flat or pitched roof. 
e.  On corners, galleries are encouraged to wrap around the sides of the building. 
f.  Open terraces are permitted on the tops of colonnades. 
g.  Colonnade floors are to be flush with the sidewalk and are not to be raised. 
6.  Porches, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  Minimum porch depth, not including ramps and steps, is six (6) feet measured from the face of the building to the outside column face. 
b.  The minimum finished floor height can be no more than eight (8) inches below the interior finished floor height. 
c.  Porches may project forward of the required setback line but may not extend beyond the lot line. 
7.  Stoops, as defined in section 1-20, shall be in compliance with the following guidelines. 
a.  Minimum stoop depth shall be three (3) feet as measured from the face of the buildings to the outside column face. 
b.  Minimum stoop length shall be four (4) feet. 
c.  Minimum finished stoop flor height can be no more than eight (8) inches below the interior finished floor height, 
d.  Stoops may project forward of the required setback line but may not extend beyond the lot line. 
e.  Stoops should be covered, either with a roof, or be part of an area inset into the main body of the building. 
E.  Transparency. Transparent windows are used to promote visibility into buildings, interest for pedestrians walking on sidewalks, and eyes on the street for safety. Transparency creates interplay between a building's interior space, exterior space, and the street. It animates the sidewalk and provides something interesting to look at while walking by. It also fosters natural surveillance of the street. 
1.  The percentage of transparency per story shall be calculated within the area between the finished floor and the finished ceiling and is a total percentage of doors and windows along that portion of the façade. The appropriate percentage of transparency on a building's façade varies depending on the use, street type, and subdistrict. These percentages are detailed below. 
a.  Ground floors of commercial buildings shall be composed of at least sixty (60) percent transparency on primary pedestrian streets and a minimum of thirty (30) percent on secondary streets and twenty-five (25) percent on east/west streets, local streets, and active alleys. 
b.  Large blank walls are prohibited 
c.  Window openings may be smaller and less frequent for multi-family residential uses, but should be expressed in such a way as to break down the facades of large buildings into smaller parts. 
d.  Ground floors of residential building facades shall be composed of at least fifty (50) percent transparency on primary pedestrian streets and a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent on secondary streets. 
e.  Clear glass is highly preferable for ground floor commercial entrance doors and storefronts to facilitate views of merchandise from the sidewalk. Tinted, reflective, or frosted glass in storefront windows is prohibited unless good cause can be shown necessitating the use of these glass options. The use of any of these options is subject to the approval of the administrator and will be considered only on a case by case basis. Where glare and heat gain are problems, other means of shielding openings such as awnings should be utilized. 
f.  Non-retail uses that do not typically use display windows or storefronts are highly encouraged to locate public uses at the street level along with other activity areas including rehearsal space, exhibition space, food service, show rooms, meetings rooms, offices, exercise rooms, common entry lobbies, and other support functions. 
F.  Storefronts and entrances. A well-designed storefront draws people inside during its hours of operation and enhances the sidewalk experience twenty-four (24) hours a day by adding visual interest and contributing to an overall image for the surrounding area. Well-designed storefronts engage pedestrians and increase street level activity. 
1.  In new buildings, the top of all storefront window sills shall be between one (1) foot and three (3) feet above the adjacent sidewalk. 
2.  In new buildings, shopfront windows are to be designed to extend up from the sill at least nine (9) feet above the adjacent sidewalk. 
3.  Permanent and temporary signs in display windows shall not obstruct more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total window glass area and should not obstruct the display area. 
4.  All signs must be coordinated to present a clear and cohesive display. 
5.  Display signs may include lettering applied directly to the glass with paint, vinyl, die cut lettering, or etching. Banners, hanging, and neon signs must be set back slightly from the glass display window. 
6.  Occupied and vacant storefronts may be used to display art as long as they allow views into the stores. These displays shall not impede more than thirty-five (35) percent of the storefront area. 
7.  Window displays should remain lit at night to animate the street level. 
8.  Storefront windows cannot be made opaque by window treatments (except operable sunscreen devices within the conditioned space). 
9.  In the cottage row subdistrict, commercial storefronts in converted historic homes shall, where possible and not precluded by the structural requirements of the building, preserve any existing multi-paned windows rather than replace them with single pane display windows. Attention can be attracted to the storefront by the use of exterior improvements like hanging signs, shingle signs, awnings, and color. 
10.  Existing warehouses that are converted to sell goods and/or art to the general public must have storefronts that are integrated with the building's openings, front the sidewalk and be visible from the street. In this instance, windows do not need to be elevated from the street. 
11.  Artist workspaces/dwellings must have storefronts that are integrated with the building's openings and front the sidewalk and are visible from the street. These storefronts are typically for workspace, studios, and exhibition space and may be larger than typical storefronts and slightly elevated above street level. Window framing materials may be atypical to differentiate these uses from other traditional commercial uses. 
12.  All uses open to the public must have an entrance to the street. 
13.  Entries and ground floors above the existing sidewalk are prohibited unless said entrances were existing as of the adoption date of this code. 
14.  Secondary shopfront entrances may face the alley or parking lot. 
15.  Main pedestrian entrances must be easily recognizable, weather protected, oriented toward the right-of-way, and at grade level. 
16.  The entrances to all shopfronts must be covered, either by an awning, canopy, or by being inset into the main body of the building. 
17.  Shopfront doors must contain at least sixty (60) percent transparent glass. Solid doors on the main shopfront entries are strongly discouraged and will be allowed only upon approval of the Administrator as a result of good cause shown. Any use of solid entry doors must be in conjunction with storefront glass areas. 
18.  Storefronts and entrances may be designed as a single continuous opening using French doors or accordion style glass doors to extend the interior space out onto the sidewalk. 
19.  When an alley or rear lane is present, garage doors must face towards the alley. 
20.  Garage doors may only be a single bay in width, up to a maximum of ten (10) feet wide when visible from the street.

1  See definitions of building height and absolute height in section 1-20. See exclusions in section 3-66 that apply to building heights. 
2  Frontage percentage means the percentage of the width of the lot that is required to be occupied by the building's primary façade. See details in section 2-44. 
3  Parking garages on alleys are not required to provide a rear yard. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-44. - Building frontage requirements. 
A.  Primary entrances. The primary entrance of new buildings must directly face a street, civic space, or public space, except: 
1.  Courtyard building entrances may face a central garden or courtyard. 
2.  Outbuildings have no requirements for the direction that primary entrances face. 
B.  Frontage percentage. Frontage percentage means the percentage of the width of a lot that is required to be occupied by the building's primary facade. Table 2-43 provides minimum and maximum frontage percentages for several building types. 
1.  Up to fifty (50) percent of the width of the primary facade may be counted as meeting the frontage percentage requirement even though it may be set back up to ten (10) feet further from the street than the primary facade's principal plane. See illustration in Figure 2-44A. 
Figure 2-44A - Frontage Percentages

2.  The location of the primary facade's principal plane is not changed by facade extensions such as bay windows, awnings, porches, balconies, stoops, colonnades, or arcades, or by upper stories that are closer to or further from the street. 
3.  The width of a porte cochere may be counted as part of the primary facade. 
C.  Forecourts. For mixed-use buildings and courtyard buildings only, a portion of the building's primary facade may be set back up to thirty (30) feet further from the street than the primary facade's principal plane if this space is constructed as a forecourt or pedestrian entryway that is open to the sidewalk. This recessed portion may be up to forty (40) percent of the total width of the primary facade and may not be used by vehicles. See illustration in Figure 2-44B. For courtyard buildings, this forecourt may extend beyond thirty (30) feet into the central garden or courtyard. 
Figure 2-44B - Forecourts

(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-45. - Parking placement. 
    Figures 2-42A through I provide requirements for parking areas that may be provided on a lot. These parking placement requirements identify the minimum distance in feet from front, side, and rear lot lines to all parking spaces, aisles, and driveways. Parking area regulations are explained in sections 3.01 and 3.02. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-46. - Streets, blocks and public spaces. 
    Streets, blocks, and public spaces, both existing and proposed, are illustrated in Figures 2-46A through D. Any proposed changes or modifications are to be made in accordance with the procedures provided within section 2-56.

(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-47. - Open spaces. 
    Open spaces can include civic spaces, view corridors and semi-public spaces. These areas are intended to remain open and not covered with structures and are not to be used for vehicular traffic. 
A.  Civic spaces. Civic spaces are a type of public space, to be constructed by the property owner during the redevelopment process. 
1.  Civic space location. The location and configuration of new civic spaces may be adjusted during the site plan approval process if the location and configuration meets these requirements: 
a.  Does not reduce the level of connectivity of surrounding streets; 
b.  Maintains or enhances pedestrian convenience and safety and does not create any traffic hazards; and 
c.  Provides substantially equal benefits, including similar size and location relative to important streets and amenities. 
2.  Civic space design. Civic spaces are to be available for civic and recreational uses and strategically placed as focal points of neighborhoods. Civic spaces can be configured as such: 
a.  An open space available for unstructured recreation, typically defined by landscaping or natural edges, rather than building frontages. Areas of shade, with seating are to be provided. 
b.  An open area suitable for unstructured recreation and gatherings, typically defined by building frontages, streets or waterways. Landscaping could include lawns, plants and trees, with the inclusion of walking paths throughout. 
c.  An open space available for public gatherings and outdoor markets, typically defined by building frontages or streets. Landscaping can incorporate pervious pavers with shade trees and available seating. 
d.  Fountains, art work, trees and shrubbery is encouraged, and shade structures, such as pergolas, can be incorporated, as space permits. 
3.  Civic space maintenance. Unless accepted by a public agency for maintenance, new civic spaces will be owned and maintained by the landowner and they must remain available for civic and recreational uses. If civic spaces are offered to and accepted by the city, maintenance will no longer be the responsibility of the landowner and the civic spaces will become public spaces that are fully accessible to the general public. 
B.  View corridors. Cocoa Beach's oceanfront is an important part of the community's cultural and ecological heritage, but it is rarely visible from the street. It is mostly viewed from the beach itself and the beachside of oceanfront buildings. 
1.  East/west street ends provide the primary access points to the beach and ocean. These street ends consist mostly of a small parking area and a non-descript dune crossover structure. As redevelopment of adjacent property occurs or as public funds become available, the ends of these streets must be redesigned to enhance views to the water and each street end should be distinctively designed. 
2.  On new construction and redevelopment, allow more views to the water from the sidewalk, street, and other public/semi-public areas by creating building separation and by creating view corridors through the building from the street. 
3.  Buildings at street ends must be set back from the sidewalk to create a transition zone of semi-public space which can highlight views and beach access points with additional landscaping, gathering spaces, or sidewalks. 
4.  For corner buildings with frontage on east/west streets, lobbies and commercial spaces must have a second entrance on the east/west street to encourage more people to walk to the end of the street and the beach. 
C.  Semi-public spaces. The placement of buildings on their lot and the spaces between the building and public spaces such as streets can be considered semi-public space. Semi-public spaces are visible from the sidewalk but not necessarily open to the public. Semi-public spaces support pedestrian activity and connectivity between private and public spaces. 
1.  Plazas, courtyards and forecourts are examples of semi-public spaces designed to attract stationary activity such as sitting, standing, and socializing, using a combination of elements such as fountains, sculptures, seating, lighting, shade structures, and exhibits. These elements are encouraged in central locations and should be visible from the sidewalk. 
2.  Plazas, courtyards, and forecourts must be designed to maximize pedestrian movement between adjacent buildings and uses. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-48. - Streets. 
    In each subdistrict, there are future public streets to be constructed by the landowner during the redevelopment process. These streets will provide direct access to every lot and will create small blocks that promote walkability and traffic circulation. 
A.  Street location. Proposed future street locations may be developed and adjusted during the site plan approval process if the new locations meet these requirements: 
1.  The new location does not reduce the level of connectivity with surrounding streets. 
2.  The new location does not reduce the level of street connectivity within the site or substantially increase the average block size. 
3.  The new location does not diminish the size of any proposed civic space. 
4.  The new location maintains or enhances pedestrian convenience and safety and does not create any traffic hazards. 
B.  Street design. Each new street must meet these design requirements: 
1.  Sidewalks must be provided on both sides of all streets. Sidewalks must be at least eight (8) feet wide. 
2.  Street trees must be provided in regularly spaced rows on both sides of all streets except where colonnades are being provided over sidewalks. Street trees may be planted in landscaped planting strips at least eight (8) feet wide or may be planted in tree wells in sidewalks if the sidewalks are widened to accommodate the trees and tree wells in addition to the required eight (8) foot minimum sidewalk width. 
3.  On-street parking must be accommodated on new streets. Parking lanes may be used for drop-off areas, valet stands, transit stops, or fire lanes. 
4.  Streets may not have more than two (2) travel lanes and must accommodate travel in both directions. One-way blocks may be considered on a case by case basis when overall traffic circulation is not impeded. 
5.  Streets or public sidewalks must provide direct access to every new lot. 
6.  Alleys or rear lanes are required in accordance with section 2-50. 
7.  All streets, alleys, and lanes must connect to other streets; cul-de-sacs and T-turnarounds are not permitted except along water bodies. 
8.  Block faces may not be longer than three hundred twenty-five (325) feet without a street, pedestrian trail, or alley providing through access to another street, pedestrian trail, or alley. 
9.  Street designs must also comply with the current edition of the Traditional Neighborhood Development chapter of the Florida Greenbook (Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, published by Florida DOT) for slow or yield movement types. Lane widths include the width of horizontal extensions of curbs such as gutter pans. 
10.  Street rights-of-way are the preferred location for water and wastewater lines; fire hydrants are the only above-ground projections of utilities that are permitted. Alleys or lanes are the preferred location for power, telephone, television, and internet cables. 
C.  Street maintenance. The landowner must construct these streets using city specifications and then dedicate them to the City of Cocoa Beach. After the dedication is accepted, the city will maintain these streets. 
D.  Street types. Listed below are descriptions of the various street types within the city. 
1.  Arterial street. State roads are conventionally arterial streets that must allow regional traffic flow along the route. SR A1A and SR 520 are the two (2) major arterial streets in Cocoa Beach. 
a.  SR A1A provides corridor access as it passes through Cocoa Beach. As such, this corridor must not only serve as a high-volume traffic roadway but also as an important public space. This corridor must be visually appealing while linking smaller streets, accommodating pedestrians, bicycles, and public transit, and it must be supportive of street-oriented businesses. 
i.  The portions of State Road A1A contained in the redevelopment districts must encourage active uses by including wide sidewalks that are shaded with awnings, overhangs, and street trees wherever possible. Active uses include cafes, restaurants, libraries, stores, educational and cultural facilities, and residential uses. 
ii.  Buildings on the redevelopment portion of SR A1A must have doors, windows, and signs designed for those approaching by vehicle, foot, or bicycle. 
b.  SR 520 is an arterial that is designed as a boulevard that features higher speed central lanes for through traffic and slower moving side access lanes for local traffic. The central and side access lanes are separated from each other by medians planted with regularly-spaced trees. 
i.  The slow moving side access lanes accommodate bicycles and on-street parking. This on-street parking is key to achieving street-oriented buildings built close to the sidewalk. 
ii.  Sidewalks on a boulevard must be a minimum of ten (10) feet wide to accommodate easy strolling for pedestrians and outdoor dining. Pedestrians on the sidewalk must be sheltered from the sun and elements with regularly planted shade trees and awnings. 
iii.  Signage along a boulevard must be designed for visibility both to passing vehicles as well as pedestrians on the sidewalk. Shopfronts should feature plentiful areas of transparent glass to give pedestrians visual access to the goods offered for sale in the shops. 
2.  Local streets. Local streets are quieter and designed to accommodate some through traffic. Local streets must have sidewalks that encourage walking and window shopping but they may also accommodate some surface parking lots. These lots must be shielded from view with landscaping or other appropriate methods which, in certain cases, may include garden walls. 
a.  New buildings on local streets must, where practical, continue commercial frontages around the corners of the building. 
b.  Attractive fences and garden walls in place of or in conjunction with landscaping shall be used to buffer surface parking areas from pedestrians on the sidewalk. 
c.  Building designs must be permeable to create and enhance views to the beach and ocean from the public sidewalk and to preserve the character and texture of existing historic and culturally significant structures and open spaces. 
d.  Wide curb cuts that accommodate head in parking are not allowed, and as much as possible, sidewalk continuity is to be maintained. 
e.  Attractive, well maintained landscaped front yards must be used to form a zone of semi-public space and to reduce the negative visual impact of parked cars facing the sidewalk. 
3.  Primary pedestrian streets. Primary pedestrian streets are the streets most attractive to pedestrians, even though they also accommodate slower-moving cars. Primary pedestrian streets can occur on some sections or all parts of certain local or arterial streets. These streets include shopping, dining, and entertainment venues that are the hub of pedestrian activity and social interactions in the redevelopment districts. Businesses along these corridors are expected to appeal to those on foot. 
a.  Vehicle access for parking and loading must be from alleys when they are present or proposed. 
b.  Storefronts and facades should be as close to the sidewalk edge as possible to create an engaging and interesting route for pedestrians. 
c.  Surface parking lots must not be visible from primary pedestrian streets. Private parking for customers, if provided, should be centralized rear parking lots that can be accessed from either a common driveway of a secondary street or from an alley. 
d.  Active uses, such as retail, physical exercise, dancing, cooking, must be the dominant use of the ground floor of buildings fronting primary pedestrian streets. 
e.  The use of removable bollards and curbless streets can allow primary pedestrian streets to be closed to traffic for street festivals and markets. 
f.  Primary pedestrian streets must have, to the greatest extent possible, uninterrupted sidewalks and storefronts to maximize the comfort, safely, and aesthetic enjoyment of pedestrians as well as automobile occupants. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-49. - Sidewalks. 
    Sidewalks shall be constructed along all public streets in accordance with section 3-31 of the Land Development Code. 
A.  In the redevelopment areas, sidewalks must be constructed on both sides of a street unless impractical to do so. 
B.  Sidewalks in the redevelopment area shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet wide. Wider sidewalks, where warranted and possible, will enhance the ability of pedestrians and bicyclists to use them for non-motorized mobility. 
C.  New buildings and building renovations can include outdoor sidewalk furniture like café tables and chairs, planters, and benches. These pieces can delineate the public walking zone from a more intimate semi-public zone that is exclusively used by a building's patrons. When placing furniture in the public sidewalk the following guidelines must be met: 
1.  Outdoor furniture in the right-of-way shall not be allowed to obstruct pedestrian movement and must be arranged to leave a five (5) foot minimum path for pedestrians. 
2.  Outdoor furniture cannot spill out in front of other storefronts except by mutual agreement of the shop owners. 
3.  Outdoor furniture must be sturdy, decorative, and well maintained to represent the image of Cocoa Beach relative to surfing, space travel, the arts or the environment. Street furniture representative of the associated business is also permitted. 
4.  When space permits, building edges must be softened with planters and landscaping to enhance the street's aesthetic quality. 
(Ord. No. 1614, § 2(Exh. A), 4-5-2018) 
Section 2-50. - Alleys and rear lanes. 
    Alleys and rear lanes supplement the access provided by streets to provide space for utility lines, to allow parking areas to be approached from the rear, to accommodate routine removal of trash and recyclable materials, and to provide supplemental access to lots. Alleys and lanes allow streets, sidewalks, and planting strips to have fewer interruptions and more on-street parking, features that promote walkability and improve safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. The maps within section 2-46 identify the locations of alleys. 
A.  Requirements for alleys and rear lanes. 
1.  Existing alley rights-of-way may not be vacated unless a redevelopment proposal would accommodate all functions of alleys in another acceptable manner. An example would be new buildings constructed along the perimeter of a block with common areas inside the block providing alley functions.

The administrator may authorize a reduction in the total number of parking spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly providing off-street parking. However, in no case may the reduction be less than the minimum required parking spaces for the use which requires the largest number of parking spaces. 
E.  Employee parking. Where off-street parking facilities are required for employees, such parking shall be clearly marked and reserved for such use. 
F.  Nonconforming use. No repairs, alterations or extensions shall be permitted to a building with a nonconforming use until the off-street parking requirements for a new use have been met. 
G.  Off-street loading; specifications; amounts. Off-street loading facilities are required so that vehicles engaged in unloading and loading will not interfere with the public use of streets and alleys. Off-street loading facilities may be shared by multiple uses if provided for in a joint shared parking agreement. 
When the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring off-street loading facilities, or it is enlarged or expanded, the full amount of off-street loading space required shall be supplied and maintained within the property of the use. 
An off-street loading space shall be an area with the minimum size dimensions required to adequately meet the needs of the property uses, as approved by the city engineer, in accordance with the city design standards. 
H.  Plans for off-street loading required. A site plan shall be submitted which accurately depicts the required off-street loading spaces, access thereto, dimensions and clearance, for final approval by the city engineer. 
I.  Limitations on off-street facilities. No facilities or area supplied to meet off-street parking requirements shall be utilized or deemed to meet requirements for off-street loading facilities. 
J.  Bicycle parking. Credit shall be granted towards the required number of parking spaces for no less than two (2), and up to four (4) percent of the required parking spaces. Bicycle parking facilities shall be as outlined in the city design standards and be of an acceptable design as approved by the city engineer. 
K.  ADA handicap parking space requirements . ADA handicapped parking spaces shall be as required by the Florida Building Code and ADA standards. Handicapped parking spaces shall have priority and they shall all be located as close as reasonably possible to the entrances to the commercial business, as approved by the administrator. 
L.  Landscaped islands required in parking lots . Parking areas with more than one hundred (100) spaces on a site shall not have more than twenty (20) consecutive spaces in a row without providing an interior landscaped island as further defined in article V, section 3-19 of this chapter. 
Section 3-02. - Special commercial district use of on-street and public parking. 
A.  Scope: The on-street and public parking regulations in this section only apply to those specific commercial land uses and areas of the city commonly known as the "downtown overlay district" and the "uptown/resort overlay district". Any business owner who seeks permit to renovate, redevelop, revitalize or reuse an existing commercial building, may also seek permission to provide a reduced number of parking spaces in conformance with this section. This section must not apply to any residential development, located within these special commercial districts, since it is not the intent of the city to encourage the survival of nonconforming or other prohibited land uses. 
B.  Findings: The city commission has declared that it is necessary to establish the special commercial districts which allows on-street and public parking to be counted towards the total parking of commercial businesses in these districts, to protect the nature and character of these historic areas, encourage a sense of community pride, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents. The following findings of fact are made: 
1.  These special commercial districts should be protected and promoted; and 
2.  Pedestrian traffic should be encouraged in these special commercial district areas; and 
3.  Insufficient land area exists in these special commercial districts to allow for the construction of sufficient off-street parking to support new and existing businesses in these areas; and 
4.  Requiring owners seeking new construction and redevelopment permits to construct the code-required off-street parking could require the razing of an inordinate percentage of certain historic structures and damage the unique character of these areas; and 
5.  Owners and tenants who seek to redevelop existing commercial lots should be encouraged to preserve the unique character of these special commercial districts; and 
6.  Allowing owners and tenants to utilize a certain amount of existing on-street and public parking towards the redevelopment of their own properties may stimulate creative design solutions and promote a sense of relatedness among properties in these special commercial districts. 
C.  Purposes, intent and objective: It is the intent of this section to relax the normal required parking standards in these special commercial districts, where the business owner may count a certain percentage of on-street and public parking towards the required parking for their place of business, with the objective to help stimulate the revitalization of these original commercial areas. 
D.  Areas described: 
1.  Cocoa Beach Causeway area, to be known as the "uptown/resort overlay district": All tracts of land as described and defined as the "uptown/resort overlay district" in chapter II, article V, establishment of form-based zoning districts; said district legally described in an exhibit and map on file in the office of the city manager; and 
2.  Historic downtown area, to be known as the "downtown area overlay district": Those lands bounded by the rights-of-way of North 4th Street, Brevard Avenue, South 2nd Street and the city "seawall line"; said district legally described in an exhibit and map on file in the office of the city manager. 
E.  Reduced parking requirement: Parking requirements for commercial land uses in only these areas may be reduced by the administrator by up to seventy-five (75) percent of the required off-street parking. When a public parking lot or facility can accommodate one hundred (100) percent of a commercial land use's parking requirement within five hundred (500) feet of that land use, parking requirements may be reduced by up to ninety-five (95) percent of the required off-street parking. Such reduction in required off-street parking does not waive any requirements to improve any off-street parking area, including but not limited to, stormwater management, handicap parking, and landscaping. When authorizing a reduction in required off-street parking, the administrator may impose certain conditions necessary to promote the intent and implement the requirements of these regulations. In determining the amount of parking required for a particular use or location the administrator's determination shall be based on the following criteria: 
1.  A site plan provided by the applicant calculating the number of off-street parking required and available for the use; 
2.  The amount and availability of on-street and public parking in the vicinity of the use; 
3.  The present demand on existing on-street and public parking in the vicinity of the use; 
4.  Future availability of on-street and public parking in the vicinity of the use. 
F.  Variances: Landowners seeking additional reduction in parking requirements must request variance approval with the board of adjustment. 
G.  Exemptions: This section shall not apply to any residential land use development located within these special commercial districts. 
H.  Non-conforming uses: The relief granted by this section must not be used to encourage the survival of nonconforming or other prohibited land uses. 
1.  Notwithstanding any other provisions in the LDC regulations, the minimum off-street parking spaces as required in section 3-01, will not apply to commercial buildings and uses in existence as of January 1, 2006, in the following described lands and areas:

In the Cocoa Beach Subdivision Plat Book 3, Page 54, 
2.  Any commercial building and/or uses in existence as of January 1, 2006, located in the area identified in subsubsection 1 above, may expand and increase the structure and or use area no more than twenty-five (25) percent without satisfying off-street parking spaces requirements, as required in section 3-01. 
3.  Notwithstanding provisions of section 3-01.C., of this code, any commercial building in existence as of January 1, 2006, located in the area identified in subsection 1. above, may change use or occupancy without having to satisfy the off-street parking space requirements in section 3-01. 
4.  Bicycle parking spaces. Credit shall be granted towards the required number of parking spaces for no less than two (2) and up to four (4) percent of the required parking spaces. 
5.  The downtown area parking study adopted by the city commission in 2015, shall be the city reference manual in further making determinations of reduced parking requirements for commercial uses in the downtown area overlay district.

Sections 3-11-3-13. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 

Section 3-14. - Intent. 
    The intent of this section is to provide landscaping in certain developments to enhance the appearance of the city and utilize the environmental and ecological benefits of trees and vegetation. Where landscaping is required as a buffer between uses, the intent is to mitigate conflict or nuisance between adjacent land uses, or a land use and a public road by providing barriers that reduce potentially adverse impacts such as noise, glare, heat, odor, light, appearance, or danger. 
    Landscaping is required in off-street parking areas to promote safe and efficient use of the facilities, conserve energy through the cooling effect of trees and vegetation and provide buffers between vehicular use areas so that potential negative impacts do not adversely affect activity in another area. Landscaping also aids in parking circulation by better directing access to proper ingress and egress points, as well as the internal movement of vehicles and pedestrians to desired areas. 
Section 3-15. - Landscaping plans. 
A.  Applications for a building permit for a new development, redevelopment or improvements to a parking lot or area shall include a landscaping plan which shall be drawn to the same scale as the site plan and submitted as part of the site plan transmittal package in conformance with the following requirements and conditions: 
1.  The species, variety, quality and size of plant material proposed for use. Existing vegetation shall be retained wherever possible and accurately shown on the landscaping plan. 
2.  An irrigation plan, including water outlet locations. 
3.  Location of all existing or proposed structures, improvements and site uses. 
4.  Tree information required, including trunk diameter at breast height, species and action to be taken for each tree, shall be summarized in legend form on the landscaping plan. 
5.  The topography of the site shall be shown on the landscaping plan. 
6.  Single-family and duplex developments are exempt from submitting a landscaping plan, except that each residential lot shall provide a minimum of two (2) beneficial trees planted on the lot within ten (10) feet of the street right-of-way. 
Section 3-16. - General landscape requirements. 
A.  Preservation and protection of existing native plant species is strongly encouraged and natural cover should be retained wherever possible. Where additional plants are required in an existing natural area, there shall be minimum disturbance to native species. Florida-Friendly landscaping shall be utilized wherever possible. 
B.  Where it is not possible to retain existing natural ground cover, landscaped areas shall be provided with other acceptable ground cover. 
C.  Landscaping that aids in soil stabilization should be used to minimize potential erosion. 
D.  Landscaping should maximize shading of the lot and off-street parking areas.

Trees shall not be planted any closer than two and one-half (21/2) feet from the edge of any parking areas and ingress/egress points, and each tree shall require a minimum of five hundred (500) square feet of rooting area. 
4.  Shrubs shall be planted at a minimum of twelve (12) inches high with eighteen (18) inches of spread for internal landscaped areas of parking lots, and a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches high for landscaped strips between parking areas, and public or private streets. Where required, a continuous hedge shall be a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches high or twenty-four (24) inches high when permitted and approved by the administrator. 
5.  Vines shall be planted which will become a minimum of thirty (30) inches high within one (1) year. Vines may be used in conjunction with walls and fences to meet the minimum screening requirements. 
6.  Ground covers shall be planted to provide reasonably complete coverage within one (1) year. 
7.  Grass species shall be those normally grown within the area, and may be seeded, sodded, plugged, or sprigged. Sod and/or ground cover plants are required for slopes greater than 4:1 (twenty-five (25) percent). 
F.  Installation of all landscaping shall conform to standard acceptable horticultural practices. 
G.  Where berms are used, slopes shall not exceed thirty (30) degrees and shall be completely covered with vegetation. 
H.  Maintenance of all landscaping is required by the property owner. Failure to maintain landscaped areas in an attractive and healthy state is a violation of this code and subject to enforcement as provided for in City Code chapter 31. 
I.  Landscaping shall meet the requirements of the sight visibility triangle defined in section 3-32. 
Section 3-17. - Required landscape buffers. 
    A landscape buffer is a specified land area which meets the opacity of a solid wall, and is designed to provide a barrier or screen between conflicting uses or between commercial and residential zoning districts. The buffer may be comprised wholly of landscaping, or it may also include a fence, wall, hedge, or berm where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired degree of buffering between adjacent conflicting zoning districts and uses. The following developments do not require landscape buffers: 
1.  Between single-family homes and/or duplexes. 
2.  Between licensed plant or tree nurseries and any other uses. Landscape buffers shall only be required for this type of use if it is located in a residential zoning district and an abutting property has a commercial zoning district classification. 
3.  Between passive recreation uses such as parks, golf courses, hiking/equestrian/bicycle trails, boardwalks or between any other development which is naturally landscaped, and any other use or zoning district. 
Section 3-18. - Development requirements for landscaping buffers. 
A.  Landscaping buffers shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet wide. Landscape buffers which include a fence or wall which meets the opacity of a solid wall shall only be required to be five (5) feet in width. Landscape buffers comprised wholly of vegetative plants are required to be ten (10) feet wide. 
B.  Landscape buffers shall meet the minimum requirements listed in section 3-16, general landscape requirements. 
C.  The landscape buffers shall be noted on the landscape plan as part of the site plan transmittal package for review and approval by the administrator. Deviations from these landscape design standards and alternative designs will be considered for approval when they are shown to meet the minimum requirements of these standards. 
D.  The following uses shall not be allowed in a required buffer: principal or accessory structures, play fields, swimming pools, tennis courts or similar active recreation uses; storage facilities, or parking facilities. 
E.  Buffers may contain stormwater retention/detention, as long as the required plantings are provided and the landscaping does not interfere with proper functioning of the drainage system and the design water depth does not harm the viability of the plantings. 
F.  Buffers shall be located wholly on the property for the use it is serving, along the property boundary between the conflicting uses or zoning districts and extend the entire length of the lot. Where an existing utility easement is partially or wholly within a required buffer, the applicant shall eliminate or minimize plantings within the easement, to reduce or eliminate the need for replanting after work has been done in the easement. 
G.  Where a proposed development is mixed-use, landscape buffers shall not be placed between conflicting mixed-uses located on the same lot, or between conflicting mixed-uses on adjacent lots under same ownership. 
H.  Screen fencing for the purposes of buffers, security or protection is permitted within all landscape buffers provided it is constructed in compliance with the following standards: 
1.  Screen fencing shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in height and have the opacity of a solid wall. 
2.  Chain-link fencing with slats is not permitted as an approved form of screen fencing and chain link fencing is prohibited along any property boundaries which abut a street. 
3.  Wherever a screen fence already exists and is built in accordance with these regulations, and it is located on an abutting lot, a second screen fence shall not be located on the proposed lot for development with the following condition. Should the existing screen fence on the abutting property ever be removed, the applicant of the proposed lot for development shall within thirty (30) days submit a building permit for a screen fence to be located on their property. 
Section 3-19. - Required landscaping in off-street parking areas. 
    All off-street parking areas, except those which serve single-family and duplex structures, shall meet the following landscape requirements, along with all of the general landscape requirements outlined in section 3-16: 
A.  A permit shall be required for development or redevelopment of any off-street parking area to serve an existing use, when it is not part of the original development or redevelopment building permit. 
B.  Parking areas that abut a public right-of-way shall include a minimum ten-foot wide landscaped buffer on the perimeter of the parking area that abuts any private or public street. 
C.  Landscaping equal to eight (8) percent of the total off-street parking area shall be provided in the interior of the parking area, and it may be in one (1) or more areas to total the required eight (8) percent, including landscape islands. Perimeter buffering beyond the minimum required may be counted as part of the interior landscaping requirement. Interior landscaping shall include at least one (1) tree for every four hundred (400) square feet, or fraction thereof, of interior landscaped area, and they shall be planted in areas capable of sustaining the full growth of the tree species proposed. 
D.  Landscape islands are required for parking areas with more than one hundred (100) parking spaces to provide relief from a large expanse of paving. These landscape islands shall count towards the interior eight (8) percent of landscaping required in subsection C. above. For all sites, there shall be no more than twenty (20) consecutive parking spaces without a landscape island. A minimum of one (1) tree shall be planted within each island. The remainder of the island shall be landscaped with grass sod or groundcover. The landscape islands shall be shown on the landscape plan for review and approval by the administrator. 
E.  Landscape buffers shall be provided between the parking area and any residentially zoned properties which abut the parking area, in accordance with section 3-18 above. 
F.  All landscaped areas serving the parking area shall be protected from encroachment by a barrier such as curbs, wheel stops, or similar devices. 
G.  All parking spaces adjacent to any structures shall be separated from that structure by a minimum five-foot wide landscape buffer, in accordance with sections 3-17 and 3-18. The landscape buffer may contain walkways, but in no instance shall the landscaped area within the buffer be less than fifty (50) percent of the total buffer area. 
H.  Parking stall depth as required in Diagram 4.01 may be reduced by two (2) feet if said reduction is added to the landscape buffer and the landscaped area is protected by either a curb or wheel stop. 
I.  The number of parking spaces may be reduced by the administrator, up to ten (10) percent of the required amount, if additional landscaping area is provided. 
Section 3-20. - Commercial trash dumpster enclosures. 
    All commercial trash dumpsters and their holding areas shall be wholly enclosed within either a natural or manmade enclosure on three (3) sides, with a gate on the access side, so as not to interfere with the ability to access and empty the dumpster. All commercial trash dumpsters shall have lids which shall remain closed at all times, except when being filled or dumped. Natural plantings shall be planted to provide complete screening of the trash receptacle at the time of planting. All fencing shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high to provide complete screening of the receptacle area. All screen fencing and landscaping shall conform to all other applicable provisions of article V. 
Section 3-21. - Tree preservation. 
    It is the intent of this section to provide regulations to protect and preserve specified tree species, minimize removal of protected trees, encourage maintenance of natural vegetation, and offset loss or injury of trees to development. Trees and natural vegetation enhance stabilization of soil, quality of water, production of oxygen, the value of lands and their improvements, promotes energy conservation through the natural cooling and shading effects, helps mitigate noise, glare, heat, air, pollution, and stormwater runoff nuisances, while also enhancing the attractiveness of streets and open spaces in developed areas. Functional conservation provides an aesthetic balance between manmade urban settings and existing native trees and vegetation. 
A.  A protected tree is any tree that meets the size requirements of section 3-23 and is not exempt pursuant to section 3-22. A tree preservation site plan shall be submitted as part of the site plan transmittal package whenever natural trees and vegetation exist on a site proposed for development, and it shall indicate those trees to be preserved, removed or replaced by location, species and circumference or diameter. The approved tree preservation plan shall specify which protected trees may be removed, preserved, or replaced. 
B.  Tree preservation site plan shall also include protective barrier and drip line locations for each tree. 
C.  Except as provided in section 3-22 of these regulations, no protected tree shall be removed except by permits obtained from the administrator. Applications for permits shall be filed and reviewed under the procedure outlined in chapter V of these regulations and shall include a statement of justification for the request, possible alternatives to removal, and a description of the trees requested to be removed. 
D.  The applicant shall take reasonable measures to design and locate the proposed improvements so the number of protected trees to be removed is minimized. Authorization for removal of a protected tree shall be granted when one (1) or more of the following conditions exist: 
1.  A permitted use of the site cannot reasonably be undertaken unless specific trees are removed or relocated. 
2.  The tree is located in such proximity to an existing or proposed structure that the safety, utility, or structural integrity of the structure is materially impaired. 
3.  The tree will interfere with the location or servicing of utility lines or services. 
4.  The tree creates a physical or visual impairment to motor, bicycle, or pedestrian traffic. 
5.  The tree is dead, diseased, or weakened and is likely to cause injury or damage to people, buildings, or other improvements. 
6.  Any law or regulation requires the removal. 
Section 3-22. - Exemptions. 
A.  The following shall be exempt from the requirements of sections 3-15 and 3-21 of these regulations: 
1.  Development or redevelopment of single-family or duplex dwellings located in the RS-1 zoning districts, except that the applicant for each residential lot shall plant a minimum of two (2) beneficial trees within ten (10) feet of the street right-of-way. 
2.  Licensed plant or tree nurseries, botanical gardens or bone fide agricultural or forestry activities. 
3.  Electrical utility facilities.

Section 3-23. - Tree preservation and reforestation standards. 
    All development not exempt from the provisions in section 3-21, shall protect all beneficial, native and non-invasive trees through preservation or replacement in accordance with the city's existing standards and the following criteria: 
A.  One protected tree for each three thousand (3,000) square feet of total land area on the lot being developed. This does not require that each three thousand (3,000) square foot area of the lot must contain a tree, since the total number of trees preserved resulting from this calculation may end up being grouped closer together. 
B.  Protected trees shall be those beneficial, native and non-invasive species of trees, as defined by a Florida licensed arborist, with a trunk circumference of six (6) inches (two (2) inches in diameter) measured at breast height. Protected trees approved for removal shall be replaced with an equal number of trunk circumference or diameter inches. 
C.  Replacement trees shall be the same circumference and diameter as protected trees and at least fifty (50) percent of these trees shall be beneficial trees. 
D.  All replacement trees shall be selected for appropriateness to this area, located to conform to accepted horticultural practice, and comply with general landscape requirements of section 3-16. 
E.  Replacement trees shall not be located as to interfere with underground or overhead utilities. 
F.  Replacement trees shall have equal shade potential and features comparable to trees removed. 
G.  All trees planted shall have a rooting area necessary for the full growth of the tree. 
H.  All trees planted shall, in general, not be planted within ten (10) feet of any existing building or property line, within twenty (20) feet of any existing tree, within six (6) feet of any pavement, nor within any utility easement. If space constraints prevent strict adherence to this criteria, an alternative proposal may be presented for consideration by the administrator. 
I.  Endangered species of trees shall be counted as meeting twice the number of other trees. 
J.  Trees identified as invasive exotic plants as listed within F.S. § 369.251, shall not be planted or utilized. Where nuisance species are present in numbers, up to thirty (30) percent reduction in required replacement circumference may be obtained by eliminating the problem species from the site. Such a request shall be made in writing at the time of site plan submittal. 
K.  As determined by the administrator and in lieu of site tree replacement, the applicant may be permitted to contribute cash to an arbor fund in an amount equal to the value in dollars of the replacement trees, including planting, as prepared by a licensed arborist. 
Section 3-24. - Tree protection standards. 
    To assure the health and survival of protected trees that are not to be removed during development activities, trees shall be protected in accordance with the following guidelines and standards: 
A.  The applicant shall take every precaution possible to prevent the following kinds of tree injuries from occurring during all phases of development: mechanical injury to roots, trunk, and branches; chemical poisoning; and injuries caused by grade changes, excavations or filling, paving, or from equipment or vehicular traffic. 
B.  A minimum forty-eight (48) inch high protective barrier, made of wood or other substantial material shall be placed around all protected trees prior to any lot development activities taking place, as follows: 
1.  No closer than ten (10) feet from a protected tree or encompassing one hundred (100) percent of the area within the tree canopy drip line. The same applies wherever clumps or groups of trees are protected together (See Figure 4-5). 
2.  The barrier shall be easily seen by equipment operators. Should a barrier make vehicular access to the property impossible, an access route will be allowed which is no wider than fifteen (15) feet, and no closer than ten (10) feet from any protected tree. 
C.  No attachment, wires (other than properly installed supportive wires), signs, or permits shall be nailed or otherwise fastened to any protected tree and no equipment, materials or debris shall be placed within the protective barrier. 
D.  Landscaping activities within the protective barrier shall be accomplished with light machinery or manual labor. 
E.  In lieu of constructing the barriers above, the applicant may instead designate areas large enough to contain the protected trees where no development activities will occur. The area shall be designated by placing stakes a maximum of twenty (20) feet apart and connecting them with colorful construction type ribbon or tape along the outside perimeter of the tree canopy drip line of all trees being protected within this area. 
F.  Protective barriers and perimeter lines shall remain until all construction activity has concluded. 
G.  Because changes in soil grade within the canopy drip line of trees can cause extensive root damage and death within the first two (2) years, grade changes shall not be made within the canopy drip line unless, the following protective measures are taken: 
1.  Raising the grade: 
a.  Option #1: Existing sod, vegetation, and leaf litter shall be removed and the soil loosened without injuring the roots. The area within the drip line shall be properly fertilized to improve the vigor and growth of the roots. 
b.  Option #2: Porous drain tiles shall be laid over the soil to drain water away from the trunk, with a drop of at least one-eighth ( 1/8 ) inch per foot, and be designed to provide adequate drainage of the existing configuration of the trees. The number of drains shall depend upon soil material, where lighter sandy soils and porous gravely material require fewer drains than nonporous soils. Aeration shall be provided by installing vertical tiles along the system. Vertical tiles shall be filled with gravel and capped with heavy-duty mesh to keep out trash and debris (See Figures 4-6 and 4-7). 
c.  Option #3: Dry wells shall accommodate the maximum growth of the tree trunk. To prevent washing material into the well, the dry well casing walls shall be high enough to bring the coping just above the level of the proposed fill and be constructed of materials that permit passage of air and water (See Figures 4-6 and 4-7). 
d.  Concrete blocks backed with galvanized screening may be used for the sides of the well. Gratings or barriers shall be used around openings large enough to present a hazard to pedestrians. Open wells should be cleaned regularly to remove sediment, leaves, and debris that might interfere with free passage of air and water. 
e.  Filling. Large stones shall be placed over the drainage tiles and a layer of smaller stones shall be placed over the remainder of the ground within the drip line. A layer of gravel shall be placed over the stones and fill shall be completed with a layer of porous soil (See Figures 4-6 and 4-7). 
2.  Lowering the grade: 
a.  When lowering the grade of soil around a protected tree, the maximum number of tree roots within the drip line shall be preserved by terracing to leave the area within the drip line at original grade, or adding a dry retaining wall, or a combination of both. 
b.  In addition to the above, roots shall be cut cleanly and trimmed after excavation and the canopy shall be pruned to aid in maintaining tree vigor.

Sections 3-58-3-60. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IX. - MISCELLANEOUS DESIGN STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS 

Section 3-61. - Building line, oceanfront property. 
    The rear setback line for properties abutting the Atlantic Ocean is established contiguous with the Coastal Construction Line (CCL) set by the State of Florida, as established by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and recorded in 1981, and as amended periodically. The board of adjustment, when ruling on variances for structures other than seawalls or revetments, must also determine that the proposed structure does not detrimentally affect the dune area or the essential character of the locality. Use of any dune area is restricted to beach access only which shall be by dune crossover as designed according to article X of this chapter. 
Section 3-62. - Permitted uses of land between building restriction line and seawall line. 
    The land between the seawall line and the building restriction line, or the actual constructed building or structure, may be used for boardwalks, pedestrian thoroughfares, promenades, revetments, fences, existing (as of September 20, 2001) public parking facilities, all supporting infrastructure and dune protection structures. Any portion of said area not so used shall be stabilized by planting sod or other suitable vegetation. No structure or use except for temporary structures authorized by the city's license agreements, shall be erected or objects placed east of the seawall line except approved dune crossovers and temporary sun shelters; except as otherwise provided below: (Please see definitions in Section 1-20) 
A.  A portion of the seawall may be constructed east of the seawall line to tie into existing seawalls when the city engineer finds this necessary to maintain the integrity of the beach area. 
B.  When a lawful nonconforming structure exists, east of the building restriction line, as of September 20, 2001, the board of adjustment can consider variances to allow expansion or additions to such structures, provided that no variance be granted that authorizes additional encroachment eastward of the existing structure stem-wall. Overhangs to an existing roof which are cantilevered eastward no more than six (6) feet from the exterior face of the stem-wall, which does not affect or require any additional foundation or stem-wall for support may also be considered as a variance.

    The site plan shall be drawn to an industry acceptable engineer's scale, but in no instance less than one (1) inch to twenty (20) feet. The requirements of this article shall be determined and expressed to the applicant at the pre-application meeting. The site plan shall show the location of the structure in relation to property lines, setbacks, easements, off-street parking and loading spaces, service areas, walls, fences, public streets, driveways, open spaces and sidewalks, utilities, landscaping, stormwater drainage, and the location and type of signs, pole and site lighting. In addition, lot areas, percentage of building ground coverage, floor elevations and square footage in each structure shall also be included. The location, screening and control of noise-producing devices, and information concerning abutting, adjacent and neighboring properties, such as land use and zoning, existing structures and existing streets or other rights-of-way shall also be included. An up to date property boundary survey, with topographic information, is also required with any site plan application, unless exempted as indicated herein. 
Section 4-02. - Site plan approval process. 
    The site plan approval process includes a site plan review that is conducted by the development review committee (DRC), which is comprised of city and outside agency staff, such as the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), the St. Johns River Water Management District, the City of Cocoa Water Department, and other outside agencies which may have jurisdiction applicable to the project. The purpose of the site plan review is to ensure that all the applicable provisions of these regulations are met by the applicant. 
    The applicant must submit three (3) paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format of the site plan, boundary survey (if not included in the site plan), traffic impact statement, tree survey, landscaping plan, and any other items listed in section 4-01 above and as specifically required by the administrator. The submittal shall be prepared, signed and sealed by an architect and/or professional engineer, licensed by the State of Florida. The applicant shall pay the required site plan review fees as established by resolution by the city commission. An application that meets all of these requirements will be considered a "sufficient" application. Additionally, prior to issuance of a building permit, the petitioner must execute and record a stormwater maintenance agreement, as required by stormwater provisions contained in these regulations. 
    In keeping with the requirements specified above, all site plans shall include the items determined to be required for the specific project by the administrator during the pre-application meeting. 
Section 4-03. - Pre-application meeting. 
    At any time in the development process, the applicant and/or city staff may formally request meetings to be called to plan out the approval process for a development, clear up any ambiguities during development, or answer any project development concerns. At a minimum, to make the approval process run as smoothly as possible for the applicant and city staff, a pre-application meeting shall be conducted for all developments which require a site plan, as outlined in section 4-01 above. The processes below may be requested: 
A.  Pre-application meeting. To ensure that the site plan or subdivision plat review process runs as efficiently as possible a pre-application conference is required to ensure that all requirements of a site plan or subdivision submittal are correct, complete and in conformance with the requirements of section 4-02. The applicant should bring with them to the meeting any plans, surveys or other maps, plans or documents which will help explain the project as sufficiently as possible. Insufficient applications will require completion in their entirety before the department of development services will accept them for review. 
B.  Change of use. The city may encourage or require a change of use (or "CUP") application with any proposal to change a residential use to commercial, or to change any commercial use from the current use to a different use. Once received, staff must complete CUP review in ten (10) days, and reply, in writing, indicating any issues which have been identified. Please reference section 4-10 for the CUP process and requirements. 
Section 4-04. - Sufficient application; development review committee; additional fees. 
A.  The purpose of the development review committee (DRC) is to review all site plans for the city. The DRC is comprised of city staff, which includes the administrator, city planner, fire marshal, city engineer, chief building official, representatives from the public works department to review the plans for stormwater, sewage, and other city utilities, along with any required outside agencies needed to review the site plan, based on jurisdictional requirements, as specified in section 4-02 above. For site plans on lots larger than three (3) acres, or which contain buildings larger than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet in size, the thresholds which then requires approvals from the planning board and city commission, this DRC review is advisory only. A sufficient site plan application and all application fees must be filed with the development services department before the DRC review can begin. Once submitted, Staff shall transmit the electronic and/or paper copies to the appropriate DRC members and outside agencies for their review and comment. The DRC reviews the site plan for compliance with the requirements of sections 4-01 and 4-02 above. The city planner shall also review the site plan for conformance with the city's Comprehensive Plan and Charter. Site plan applications requiring approvals from the planning board and city commission must make application a minimum of forty-five (45) days in advance of the planning board meeting where their application will be heard. 
B.  Deposits and fees for city costs. In situations where a site plan or subdivision application, a development or project, or a legal agreement is expected to generate additional costs for the city to process or review, such as but not necessarily limited to attorney fees, consultant fees, reproduction fees or delivery fees, the city shall have the right to require the applicant to provide a deposit for such city expenses into a city established escrow account, which will be drawn on monthly as required, and enter into a "review and processing escrow agreement" with the city. The need for and the amount of such a deposit shall be as reasonably determined by the administrator. Said escrow deposit shall be replenished as necessary to ensure full payment to the city. In cases of late payment, nonpayment or insufficient deposit amount, the city shall have the right to suspend processing application reviews, issue stop work orders, stop the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or otherwise suspend project processing activity. During such suspension, all normal resubmittal and application expiration deadlines shall continue to apply. 
C.  Report; changes by applicant. Within five (5) business days, from the submittal date of a sufficient application, the DRC members shall all meet for a site plan review, with the applicant present whenever possible, and share their comments and recommendations with all attendees. Some or all issues and/or recommendations may be worked out at the meeting between the applicant and DRC members, and those items still unresolved shall be placed in writing and distributed to all DRC members and the applicant within forty-eight (48) hours of the DRC site plan review meeting. The applicant shall have an opportunity to review the final, remaining unresolved comments and recommendations and make any changes on the site plan to conform to the recommendations. 
D.  The applicant may request in writing one (1) continuance of the time frame indicated above in paragraph A. A requested continuance may be no greater than sixty (60) days. 
E.  Site plans revised to meet the comments of the DRC site plan review must be submitted to the development services department within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the DRC site plan review meeting. Failure to submit revised site plans by this deadline shall result in an automatic withdrawal of the application. 
Section 4-05. - Planning board site plan review. 
A.  Planning board review. The planning board and city commission shall only be required to review site plans in excess of three (3) acres in size, or which contain buildings in excess of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. All site plans smaller than these thresholds shall only require a DRC site plan review and approvals by city staff and required outside agencies. Staff reports for planning board review will be prepared by the development services department, and will accompany the site plan being reviewed in the agenda packet. The site plan and Staff report shall then be provided to the planning board a minimum of five (5) business days prior to the meeting where the site plan will be reviewed for consistency with the city's LDC regulations and Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Conclusions and recommendations. Should the planning board find the site plan to be in compliance with the LDC regulations and Comprehensive Plan, they shall recommend that the city commission approve the site plan as sufficient, with any conditions placed on the site plan by the board. Should the planning board find any part of the site plan to be noncompliant with the LDC regulations and/or the Comprehensive Plan, those noncompliant parts shall be made compliant before taking the site plan to the city commission for review and final approval. The planning board shall not recommend the city commission deny a site plan that complies with the LDC regulations and Comprehensive Plan. The board's conclusions, conditions and recommendations shall be added to the staff report and the administrator shall ensure the revised staff report is submitted to the city commission in their agenda packets for their final review and action. 
Section 4-06. - City commission site plan review. 
A.  If the site plan is approved by the planning board the development services department shall submit the site plan, the staff report, and any conclusions, conditions or recommendations for approval, to the city commission for their review and action at their next regularly scheduled meeting, but in no case more than forty-five (45) days after planning board approval. The site plan shall be placed on a city commission consent agenda. Upon review of the site plan, the city commission shall: 
1.  Approve the site plan, with or without conditions; or 
2.  Deny the site plan, and identify findings and/or reasons for the denial; or 
3.  Return the application to the development services department and/or the planning board as recommended by the city commission, for further review and recommendation. 
B.  Following city commission approval, approval with conditions, or denial, the commission's action(s) shall be promptly implemented by the development services department. 
C.  The city commission's action shall be final. Failure of the city commission to act on a site plan application within forty-five (45) days of the planning board's recommended approval shall be considered as final approval of the site plan, and acceptance of the planning board's recommendation(s) and any associated conditions for approval. 
Section 4-07. - Building permit application; as-builts and performance bond. 
A.  Once the site plan has received final approval from either the DRC, or the city commission, as determined by the size of the development as defined in section 4-05.A. above, the applicant may submit their construction plans to the chief building official for building permit review and approval. 
B.  Building permit; pre-construction meeting and approval. The review of building and/or construction plans shall be done by the chief building official and/or his designee to ensure that all applicable provisions of this code and all applicable building, electrical, engineering, and other related provisions are complied with by the applicant. No building permit shall be issued by the city until the construction plans have been approved and accepted by the chief building official and/or his designee(s). Depending on the magnitude, complexity or special timing required for construction of a specific project, the chief building official and/or administrator may determine that a pre-construction meeting shall be required with the applicant and/or general contractor. If a pre-construction meeting is required, no work or limited work may commence on the site until the meeting has been held, as determined by the administrator or chief building official. After site plan and building permit approval, the development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved site plan and building permit. If determined to be required by the administrator, a development order may be negotiated between the city and applicant prior to the start of construction. Please also see section 4-30, building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
C.  As-built plans; performance bond. Prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the applicant must provide the development services department with two (2) paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format of the "as-built" plans which show any changes to the approved site plan. Staff shall use the as-built plans to inspect and verify the changes to the approved site plan. Any deficiencies must be identified to the applicant in writing. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the approved "as-built" site plan has been completed and accepted. A performance bond pursuant to paragraph E below, equal to one hundred twenty (120) percent of the cost of the uncompleted improvements may be accepted in lieu of completion of the site plan requirements, as determined by the administrator, city engineer or chief building official, and the circumstances involved. 
D.  Development schedule. The applicant must provide a development schedule which shall include the anticipated start of construction for the project and all phases, and the anticipated date of completion for the project and any phases. 
E.  Performance bond. A performance bond may be required by the administrator, the city engineer, or the chief building official. This performance bond is defined as a surety executed by an approved corporate surety company for the purpose of guaranteeing the installation of, and/or maintenance of, required site improvements. Bonding requirements may also be met by, but not limited to: escrow deposit; cashier's check; certified check; or irrevocable and unconditional letters of credit. A bond may also be referred to, or referenced as an improvement bond and/or a maintenance bond. 
Section 4-08. - Duration of site plan; extensions; development of site; work stoppages. 
A.  Time frame. Following issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall have twenty-four (24) months to commence construction on the site or the site plan and any associated waivers or variances will be deemed expired; and, resubmittal and approval of the site plan and any associated waivers or variances shall be required, before a new building permit can be submitted for review and approval. 
B.  Extension; application for. One (1) extension of one (1) calendar year may be granted by the city commission following recommendation by the planning board following review and recommendation by staff upon written request by the applicant. Consideration of an extension may occur only if an application for an extension is received prior to the twenty-four (24) month expiration date, and where conditions or codes have not changed. 
C.  Development of site under an approved site plan. If the certificate of occupancy (CO) on the site has not been issued within two (2) years from the date of issuance of the building permit, then the building permit shall be deemed to have expired, and the applicant must make application for a new site plan review and approval and a new building permit, to continue with construction. 
D.  Work stoppages; unforeseen events. Unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, may occur which lead to cessation of construction for periods greater than thirty (30) days. In these circumstances, the applicant must contact the administrator in writing, and explain the reasons for the work stoppage, and identify a work start date. If the applicant anticipates a work start date beyond ninety (90) days, then this delay must be approved in writing by the administrator, to avoid site plan and building permit expiration. 
Section 4-09. - Modifications to site during construction. 
A.  When a site plan on a single lot is approved, any subdivision or augmentation to the land in said site plan prior to or during construction and build-out must be resubmitted and undergo the site plan review and approval process again, prior to any further construction taking place on the site. Additionally, any changes to the landscaping, traffic flow and accesses, utility requirements and/or the stormwater management plan shall also require re-submittal and undergo the site plan review and approval process, through the procedures set forth in this article. 
B.  Revisions and/or modifications to approved site plans while under construction which comply with city regulations and which do not increase the gross square footage of a building or adversely impact compliance with the approved site plan, may be approved by the administrator or his designee(s). All revisions and/or modifications shall be shown on the "as-built" plans as required by section 4-07.C. above. 
Section 4-10. - Change of use (CUP). 
A.  Change of use (CUP). Whenever there is a change in the use of a property or structure when a new and different business moves into an existing location or an existing business is desirous of expanding their business on site, a CUP review may be required, as determined by the administrator. In the CUP review process, staff identifies what city reviews, permits, actions, code upgrades, and/or what new fees or costs might be incurred as a result of the change in use. Upon receipt of a CUP application, the development services department promptly forwards all information required and provided by the applicant to the development review committee (DRC) for review and comment. Within ten (10) business days after review, staff shall reply to the applicant in writing with a CUP decision, which identifies any code-required site improvements, permit reviews, and any required additional fees. 
B.  Any person may request a CUP review. To assist staff with their review, the applicant shall provide as much information about the new use, the facility, and its location as possible. Items most helpful in a CUP review include a copy of the site survey, the site plan and/or floor plan. Common issues which the staff examines includes: a) the previous use; b) the proposed type of business and hours of operation; c) the size and floor area of the business; d) the amount of existing on-site parking and handicap parking; and, e) all Florida and ADA site and structure accessibility standards which are currently being met.

Sections 4-25-4-29. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - BUILDING PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY 

Section 4-30. - Building permit; certificate of occupancy administration and enforcement. 
A.  Administration and enforcement. The chief building official (CBO) shall be designated as the administrative official to administer and enforce building permits, certificates of occupancy and other such certificates, as required by the Florida Building Code or other city codes. For these regulations the chief building official (CBO) may also mean the building inspector/plans examiner/building official, as the case may be, and vice-versa. The Florida Building Codes are the controlling authority for building permits issued in the City of Cocoa Beach. 
    If the CBO finds that any provisions of this article are being violated, he shall notify the person responsible for such violation, and if deemed necessary, have the code enforcement officer (CEO) provide the property owner with written notification of violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto; removal of illegal buildings or structures; discontinuance of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this article to insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions. 
    The CBO shall review and approve such plans and specifications, issue such permits and certificates, make such inspections, and maintain such records of his actions as are necessary to enforce the provisions of this article. All such records shall be public records. 
B.  Building permits required. No fence, building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to, or altered in any way which affects the structural load-bearing or supporting mechanisms or apparatuses of a building or structure, without a building permit therefore issued by the CBO. Starting construction without a valid building permit in hand, is a violation of this article. No building permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this article. If the applicant is unsure whether a building permit is required, there exists a complete list of items which require a building permit on the city website under the development services department, building and permitting division pages, or the applicant can simply call the building division and ask an inspector. 
    After a building permit has been issued, only the work depicted on the approved site plan and building permit may be performed, and no other or additional work is permitted without prior written authorization from the CBO and/or administrator, or as the case may require, the DRC, planning board and city commission, depending on the scope of additional work requested to be done. Any work done outside of or beyond the scope of work approved on the site plan and/or building permit shall be deemed a violation of these regulations. 
C.  Application for building permit. All applications for building permits shall be made in conformity with this article and other applicable city codes, including those applicable to the building and construction industry. All applications shall be accompanied by either a site plan, plans for construction and/or project descriptions which depict the actual work to be done, including dimensions and the shape of the lot; the exact sizes and locations of any existing buildings; and, the size, shape, and location of the building or alteration, including any accessory buildings or structures. The application shall include such other information as may be required by the CBO, including existing or proposed building and/or land uses; the number of families, housekeeping units or rental units the building is to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine conformance with and provide for the enforcement of this article. 
    One (1) copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant after CBO shall have marked such copy either as approved, approved with written comments, or disapproved and attested to same by his signature. This copy of the plans shall be available at the construction site at all times during construction. The second copy of the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained and recorded by the CBO in accordance with state retention requirements and mandated by statute. 
    No building permit shall be granted for the construction, addition or alteration of a place of assembly unless plans signed by a registered architect or registered engineer according to the laws of the State of Florida governing the practice of architecture accompany the permit application. 
D.  Certificates of occupancy (C of O). It shall be unlawful to use, occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building, premises, or both, or any part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) or a certificate of occupancy (C of O) has been issued by the CBO for the work completed. 
    No nonconforming structures or use shall be maintained, renewed, changed or extended until a C of O has been issued by the CBO, after receiving approval from the administrator. The C of O shall state where the nonconforming use differs from the provisions of this article, provided that, upon enactment or amendment of this article, owners or occupants of nonconforming uses or structures shall have three (3) months to apply for a C of O. 
    A temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) may be issued by the chief building official for the temporary occupancy of a building when all but the final inspection has been performed and upon request of the applicant, should the CBO deem the building to be safe to occupy, for the purposes of allowing the applicant or future tenant to receive temporary utility services for building maintenance and operations, for system and utility testing purposes, or for stocking of inventory and doing other types of preparatory work needed prior to opening for business. Such TCO may require such other conditions and/or safeguards as will protect the safety of occupants and the public, as determined by the CBO. 
    The CBO is also authorized to issue other certificates as specified in the adopted building code or as may be required by other City Codes or regulations. 
E.  Expiration of building permit. If the work described in any building permit has not started within six (6) months from the date of issuance, said permit shall expire; it shall be cancelled by the CBO; and written notice shall be provided to the affected persons. 
    If the work described in any building permit has not been started within one year of the date of issuance, said permit shall expire and be cancelled by the CBO, and written notice shall be provided to the affected persons, with notice that further work as described in the cancelled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new building permit has been obtained. This provision shall apply to building permits outstanding at time of adoption of these regulations. 
F.  Right of entry. For the purpose of enforcing this article, the CBO or his authorized representatives shall have the right to enter onto private property and into private buildings, while construction is in progress, at any reasonable time. Any person refusing or obstructing such entry shall be guilty of a violation of these regulations. 
Section 4-31. - Site improvement acceptance. 
    When deemed necessary to ensure compliance with other city codes or regulations, the CBO may require a statement under the seal of the professional engineer of record, licensed by the State of Florida, certifying that, based on their inspection, the site construction has been done in accordance with the approved site plan, building permit and all applicable city codes and regulations. The CBO may also require statements of acceptance from other city departments or outside agencies having jurisdiction. 
Section 4-32. - Appeals and interpretations. 
    Any appeal of a decision or interpretation made by the CBO or administrator and/or designees in administering or enforcing this chapter or the adopted building code, shall be processed in accordance with procedures for such appeals as set forth in the chapter I, article IX, as appropriate.

One (1) extension of one hundred eighty (180) days may be granted by the building official upon the applicant demonstrating that the work can be completed within that time frame, the delay was unavoidable, and denial of the extension would create an undue hardship. 
F.  Multiple businesses: Where a lot is occupied by multiple businesses (e.g., a shopping center), sign permits shall be issued in the name of the property owner or agent, rather than in the name of the individual businesses. The city shall enforce only the provisions of this chapter and not the provisions of any private restrictions or covenants. 
G.  No new or altered sign shall be approved for use until inspected by the city and found to be in compliance with this chapter and any applicable technical codes, such as: 
1.  The installation and erection of all signs and their structural, electrical and safety features shall be in accordance with the Florida Building Code, the National Electrical Code, and all City Codes. 
2.  All signs shall comply with provisions of the zoning district in which they are located. 
3.  Prior to final inspection of new ground signage, the applicant shall submit a special purpose or certification of location from a land surveyor licensed in Florida, to be kept as a permanent record by the city. 
H.  All signs are subject to periodic inspection by the city. All parts of all signs shall be maintained in a state of good and safe repair, remain in compliance with all building codes and, if painted, they shall be touched-up or repainted whenever the paint is peeled, blistered, or faded, as required. The area immediately surrounding ground signs shall be kept free of all untended vegetation and debris. The code enforcement officer shall inform the owner in writing when any requirements of this chapter are violated. 
Section 5-21. - Sign permit fees required. 
    Upon approval of the applicant's sign permit, the applicant agrees to pay any required building and electrical permit fees, and any sign permit fee(s) as approved by resolution by the city commission. These permit fees shall be applicable and include a plan review fee, a sign base fee, a re-inspection fee, and a double fee for signs placed without the required permits and/or fees being paid. 
Section 5-22. - Criteria for placement of signs. 
    The size, number, height and placement of signs is dependent upon the zoning district in which the sign(s) will be located. All signs shall comply with the standards specified in this chapter, and failure to comply shall be considered a violation of this chapter and/or result in the denial of a requested permit. 
A.  Determining area: For the purpose of determining the area of signs, the total area is that which is located within the exterior framework which contains the entire sign face, regardless of the shape of the sign. Three-dimensional signs shall be measured at the largest vertical cross section. 
B.  Combination of signs: Except where specifically allowed, the areas of more than one (1) sign may not be combined to allow a larger size, height or sign area, than that listed for a single sign in the zoning district. 
C.  Display of sign permit number: All signs requiring a permit shall prominently display the permit for the sign on the property where the sign is located. 
D.  Measurements: Measurements for setback and location of authorized signs shall be made in a straight line from that portion of the sign nearest the property boundary, to the property boundary. Except for the thickness of wall signs, no sign shall project into or over public property or right-of-way, whether affixed to a building or otherwise. The height of signs shall be measured from the developed grade level on the property, next to the nearest street paving or paved pedestrian sidewalk, to the highest point of the sign, including all decorative portions of the sign. The following measurements apply to the type of sign listed: 
1.  Ground or monument signs: 
a.  Ground or monument sign: The front setback shall be a minimum of five (5) feet, the side street setback shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet, setbacks from abutting properties shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet when the property frontage width is greater than one hundred (100) feet, or a minimum of five (5) feet when the property frontage is one hundred (100) feet or less. No ground or monument sign shall be located closer than fifteen (15) feet from any other ground or monument sign. 
b.  Ground or monument signs located next to an access driveway shall be located so that their placement does not constitute a public safety or sight visibility hazard as determined by the city engineer. 
2.  Marquee, canopy, projecting, shingle, and/or hanging signs: The bottom of all marquee, canopy, and/or hanging signs shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet above the ground surface directly beneath the sign. Signs attached to a marquee or canopy are considered wall signs and not projection signs, and for the purposes of these regulations they may not extend more than twelve (12) inches beyond the limits of the awning, marquee, or canopy. 
3.  Roof signs: Roof signs may only be permitted where it can be demonstrated by the applicant that it is not possible to adequately identify the commercial use on the commercial property by the use of any other type of approved signage in a commercial zoning district. Roof signs are not allowed in residential zoning districts. Roof signs are not allowed where a commercial property or business is already being served and identified by a pole, monument or wall sign. The maximum height of roof signs shall be eight (8) feet above the point where the roof and sign are connected, but in no case shall the top of any roof sign be higher than the top of the roof, except in the case of a special hardship, as determined by the board of adjustment, when a ground sign cannot be installed because the location of the principal structure prohibits such ground installation. If approved by the board of adjustment, a roof sign may be installed up to eight (8) feet beyond the highest point of the roof with the same sign area allowed for ground or monument signs. This provision does not preempt or provide variance to any other regulation regarding maximum height of structures or attachments to buildings that may be found in these LDC regulations, the Comp Plan or the City Charter. 
4.  Wall signs: Wall signs may not project more than twelve (12) inches from the wall and may not extend above the roof or facade line, nor shall they overhang a property line or public right-of-way. Wall signs attached to and extending below a marquee or canopy are considered hanging signs, and the bottom of these signs shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet above the ground surface directly beneath the sign. Wall signs on multi-story multi-tenant buildings and shopping centers shall not be located above the second story of such buildings, unless their location is approved in a uniform master sign plan. 
E.  Number of signs: A sign shall be considered to be a single display surface containing elements organized, related or composed to form a unitized message. Signs consisting of a group of detached letters or two (2) or more panels on the same plane and on the same supports, presented as a single display, shall be considered as one (1) sign and the area shall be as defined above. A double-faced sign in which the faces are parallel and opposite shall be considered a single sign and the area shall be computed using only one (1) sign face. Temporary signs shall not be counted in the allowed number of signs. 
F.  Pitched roofs: Buildings with pitched roofs may erect roof signs parallel to the street in place of allowed wall signs. The top of these signs may not exceed the roof peak height, except as allowed in subsection D.3. above. 
G.  Required signs: All residential and commercial buildings located within the city shall have street numbers, a minimum of four (4) inches in height, displayed in such a way as to be visible from the nearest street, in order to comply with the Brevard County E-911 addressing requirements. In shopping centers, these numbers can be displayed on ground signs. Residences can meet the requirement if street numbers are displayed on mailboxes visible from all directions of traffic flow. 
H.  Neon signs: The use of neon gas illuminated signage is allowed, in accordance with all other regulations of this chapter. 
Section 5-23. - Sign maintenance required. 
    All signs, including exempt signs, shall be maintained in a structurally sound condition, and in generally good repair. Permanent signs shall be maintained in accordance with the Florida Building Code, which requires that all signs be maintained to prevent rust and corrosion. If any part of the sign is painted, it shall be touched-up or completely repainted as required, as the condition of the sign dictates. Any sign damaged beyond repair as determined by the building official, shall either be repaired or removed at the property owner's expense within thirty (30) days of being noticed in writing by the city. Nonconforming signs damaged beyond repair can only be replaced with new signs in compliance with all current city codes, and a new sign permit shall be required. Signs not repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days shall constitute a public nuisance and be removed at the property owner's expense. 
Section 5-24. - Uniform master sign plan requirements. 
A.  Uniform master sign plan (UMSP) requirements: A property owner may elect to submit a uniform master sign plan (UMSP) with the administrator as an alternative, and in lieu of meeting the strict requirements of subsections A. through E. of section 5-05 above, if any of the following situations exist: 
1.  When a person owns two (2) or more contiguous lots, which may or may not be separated by streets or alleys. 
2.  When a person owns a single lot with more than one (1) principal building on said lot. 
3.  When a property contains a condominium project. 
4.  When competing businesses are located adjacent to or directly across from their competition and the two (2) businesses are located within different zoning districts. 
5.  When a property owner is desirous of implementing modifications and/or changes to their existing nonconforming signage. 
6.  When signs are located within the B-1 or the PS-1 zoning districts. 
B.  At a minimum, the UMSP application must contain the following: 
1.  An accurate site plan of the lot or lots, drawn to scale, which accurately shows the location of all buildings, structures, parking lots, driveways, pools, fences, landscaped areas and the accurate location of all existing and all future proposed signs, excluding incidental and temporary signs. 
2.  Computations of the maximum total combined sign area of all signs, the sign area for all individual signs, the height of all signs and the number of freestanding ground signs on the lot(s). 
3.  Photographs of all existing signage and drawings of all proposed signage, including colors, lettering style, symbols, construction methods and materials, and lighting, along with all sign area computations for all proposed new signs. 
C.  A UMSP can accommodate up to a twenty (20) percent increase in the maximum total combined sign area allowed for each included lot, in accordance with the following restrictions: 
1.  No ground sign area may be increased above the maximum allowable area specified in subsections A. through E. of section 5-05, above. 
2.  No more than two (2) total and additional monument signs may be added to the lot(s). Each of these two (2) additional signs must meet the criteria of the second monument sign, as specified in subsections A. through E. of section 5-05, above; and, 
3.  No more than two (2) total and additional wall signs may be added to the lot(s). Each of these two (2) additional signs must meet the criteria of the side or rear wall signs, as specified in subsections A. through E. of section 5-05, above. 
D.  Following submittal of a UMSP the administrator shall review the proposed plan and request and/or recommend modifications as needed, to meet the intent and purpose of these regulations. All UMSPs must be approved by resolution of the city commission following recommendation and/or conditions as provided by the administrator. 
E.  Additional requirements: The UMSP must be designed so that it establishes and follows a common signage theme and/or design, uses similar and compatible construction methods, colors, lettering, symbols, scale and size, and backgrounds. The applicant shall not be allowed to receive any sign permits until the UMSP has been approved by resolution of the city commission. If a UMSP has been approved, all subsequent sign permit requests must verify that the sign being requested is one (1) of the approved signs listed on the UMSP. 
Sections 5-25-5-27. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - SIGN REMOVAL; EXCEPTIONS; AND APPEALS 

Section 5-28. - Penalties for violation. 
    It shall be unlawful to violate any of the provisions of this chapter and any violation shall be punished in a manner provided by City Code of Ordinances chapter 31. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense. 
Section 5-29. - Interpretation. 
    This chapter shall be interpreted by the administrator. Section 5-20 shall be interpreted by the chief building official. Disputes and appeals shall be referred to the city manager and/or the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of chapter I, article IX. 
Section 5-30. - Removal of signs. 
A.  Removal of business signage is the responsibility of the property owner. When a business moves or closes, all signs, including their supports, may remain, provided the sign structure is in compliance with current codes, the printed advertisement is removed, and the sign is maintained in good condition. If any part of the sign face, frame or structure is removed and not replaced within thirty (30) days of being removed, the entire sign structure must be removed. Portable signs must be removed per section 5-04. 
B.  Any unauthorized or prohibited sign located on any city property, public rights-of-way, utility poles or trees will be removed by the city without notice to the owner of the sign. Such signs shall be stored by the city for five (5) days before being destroyed or discarded. If the owner of the sign is known, a notice of violation against City Code may be issued in accordance with City Code chapter 31. 
Section 5-31. - Exceptions and appeals. 
A.  The administrator may exempt legal nonconforming signs from the requirements of this chapter related to height, sign area, and projection from the building, if the sign owner can demonstrate that the nonconformity is within twenty (20) percent of each specific requirement. However, in no instance may a ground sign exceed eighteen (18) feet. A sign must be brought into compliance if it is substantially damaged beyond fifty (50) percent of its current replacement value. Signs with multiple nonconformities must cure all other sign nonconformities before an administrative waiver or board of adjustment variance can be requested for the single remaining nonconformity. 
B.  Rooftop sign exemption: The board of adjustment may approve an exemption from the provisions of this chapter pertaining to rooftop signs at a height greater than forty-five (45) feet based on a finding that: 
1.  It is a preexisting sign. 
2.  The board of adjustment deems it to be the optimum design for the specific site conditions. 
3.  The sign does not detract from surrounding businesses. 
4.  The sign area does not exceed that allowed for a roof sign within the zoning district where it exists. 
C.  Previously granted sign variances: Sign variances granted prior to the effective date of these LDC regulations, except those granted for the location of the sign, are repealed. Any remaining sign granted a variance prior to the effective date of these LDC regulations, that is not in compliance with this chapter, shall be treated under this chapter as a nonconforming sign, and section 5-15.D. above shall be enacted on said nonconforming signage. 
Sections 5-32-5-34. - Reserved. 
CHAPTER VI - LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) CONCURRENCY; VESTED RIGHTS AND NONCONFORMITIES 
ARTICLE I. - LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT 

Section 6-01. - General provisions/purpose, intent and applicability. 
    This article provides processes for measuring compliance with level of service (LOS) standards adopted in the Comprehensive Plan for the following public facilities: roads; potable water; sanitary sewer; solid waste; drainage; public schools; and, recreation and open space. No building permit shall be issued unless adequate public facilities are available as determined by the concurrency evaluation. 
    The concurrency evaluation (CE) is one factor in the development review process, and compliance with only this chapter does not guarantee approval of the project. Unless otherwise provided herein, this chapter shall apply to all new developments of structures or property. The provisions of this chapter shall assess only the net impacts created from the development of a lot. Please reference section 6-08 of this article which lists those projects exempt from the concurrency evaluation review process. 
Section 6-02. - Application for concurrency evaluation (CE) and review. 
A.  A nonbinding concurrency evaluation (CE) prior to application for zoning, special exception or variance, or a binding CE prior to application for site plan, subdivision and/or building permit approval may be requested by the applicant. If the CE is requested to be separate from a site plan, subdivision or building permit application, since concurrency is performed during those reviews, then the application, along with a fee as may be established by resolution of the city commission, shall contain the following information and any other information which the administrator deems necessary to perform the evaluation: 
1.  Name, address, email address and telephone number of the applicant. 
2.  Legal description, plat, or boundary survey and size of property in acres. 
3.  Type of CE requested (non-binding or binding). 
4.  Specific use with square footage and number of units and any required phasing. 
5.  Stormwater management plan. 
6.  Significant traffic impact study if required by the city engineer. 
7.  Completed Brevard County School Impact Analysis (SIA) for residential subdivisions or site plans. 
B.  Review generally. If a non-binding CE is requested separate from a site plan, subdivision or building permit, the administrator or his designee shall perform the CE and issue a finding of either non-deficiency or deficiency. If a binding CE is requested to be done, the evaluation shall occur at the same time as the review of the site plan, subdivision or building permit review. 
Section 6-03. - Concurrency evaluation (CE) finding of non-deficiency validity. 
A.  Site plan approval non-deficiency findings are valid for the life of the site plan. 
B.  Subdivision non-deficiency findings are valid until all required improvements have been installed and approved by the city. 
C.  Building permit non-deficiency findings are valid until the construction has been completed and approved by the city. This includes vested projects. 
Section 6-04. - Concurrency evaluation (CE) findings. 
A.  The administrator shall use the CE parameters provided in this article for the seven (7) public facilities to determine if a proposed project is found to be non-deficient or deficient. 
B.  A non-deficiency finding is made when a proposed project is found to be non-deficient for all seven (7) public facilities. 
C.  A deficiency finding is made if a proposed project is deficient for any of the seven (7) public facilities, and no building permit will be issued until a non-deficiency finding is made. 
Section 6-05. - Records of level of service (LOS). 
    The city shall maintain all written records of the LOS allocations permitted by all binding CEs for all public facilities provided to a development. 
Section 6-06. - Appeals. 
A.  Appeals from the decisions of the administrator shall be processed in conformance with chapter I, article IX "duties of officials: matters of appeal" of these regulations. 
B.  School board finding of "no capacity." Applicants wishing to appeal a finding by the school board must follow those procedures found in the city Comprehensive Plan, "public schools facilities element", or as set forth in the applicable school board and city interlocal agreement. 
Section 6-07. - Level of service (LOS) evaluation criteria. 
    The city shall use the following criteria to determine if the LOS is adequate to support the impacts on the public facilities by a proposed development. This system is designed to utilize the most recent and available data regarding all public facilities. 
A.  Transportation or road concurrency. 
1.  Capacity for transportation facilities shall be evaluated using the conceptual planning techniques described in the most current version of the level of service handbook, prepared by the Florida Department of Transportation. 
2.  The transportation facility shall have the capacity to serve a proposed development at the adopted LOS standards found in the "mobility element" of the Comprehensive Plan, which classifies our city and state streets and highways. 
3.  Projected impacts on the transportation facility shall be determined by using the trip generation standards set forth in the most current version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, "Trip Generation Manual," or by a study based on accepted traffic engineering principals. 
4.  The CE shall be measured at the points accessing the transportation facility link or segment. 
5.  To determine the capacity of the transportation facility, all projects funded for construction in the city's capital improvements program, and those funded by county, state or federal agencies shall be a part of the system. 
6.  If the proposed development accesses a state or county transportation facility, the city shall require written approval from the county or state that access will be approved upon submittal of an appropriate application. 
7.  The current LOS shall be based upon the most recent average and peak-hour traffic counts plus projected traffic from approved developments in the City of Cocoa Beach. 
8.  Developments participating in the proportionate fair share program, as stated in section 6-10 below, will be allowed to obtain concurrency approval. 
9.  The calculation of traffic generated by development shall be based on the parameters outlined in most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Handbook, and as approved by the city engineer. 
B.  Sanitary sewer concurrency. 
1.  The capacity for sanitary sewer shall be determined by subtracting the committed capacity and present flow from the approved design of the treatment facility. The water reclamation department shall determine whether the capacity is available for the project. 
2.  The impact on the sewage treatment plant shall be determined by using the LOS standard of one hundred (100) gallons per person per day (average daily) and one hundred thirty (130) gallons per person per day (peak daily). 
C.  Solid waste concurrency. The city has established the LOS standard for solid waste of eight (8) pounds per person per day, based on the total city residents (permanent and seasonal) and tourists. 
D.  Drainage and stormwater management concurrency. 
1.  The city shall determine whether a proposed project meets the adopted LOS standard of retention of the first one (1) inch of runoff for sites smaller than one hundred (100) acres and the first one-half (1/2) inch of runoff for sites of one hundred (100) acres or more; and detention capacity sufficient to ensure that post development runoff will not exceed predevelopment runoff for the ten (10) year twenty-four-hour storm event. 
2.  The city shall be provided written documentation that a proposed project meets all applicable stormwater provisions by the St. Johns River Water Management District prior to building permit approval. 
3.  All proposed projects shall conform to the city stormwater master plan. 
E.  Potable water concurrency. The city requires all applicants to obtain written approval from the City of Cocoa utilities department prior to building permit approval. The adopted LOS standard for potable water is one hundred twenty-nine and thirty-four hundredths (129.34) gallons per person per day. 
F.  Park and recreation concurrency. 
1.  The city shall determine whether a proposed residential project meets the adopted LOS standard of ten (10) acres of parks per one thousand (1,000) residents. The adequacy of parks and recreation needs shall be based upon the city as a whole, rather than individual neighborhood areas. 
2.  The impact of the proposed development shall be determined by multiplying the official University of Florida, Bureau of Economic and Business Research "household size multiplier" for the city by the proposed number of units in the project to determine the total population for the project. The current population of the city, plus the additional population from committed projects shall be added to the projected population of the proposed project in order to determine total projected population. 
G.  Reclaim water concurrency. All development shall connect to the reclaim water system where the system is located within any adjacent right-of-way of the lot or subdivision being developed. 
H.  Public school concurrency. As set forth in the school board and city interlocal agreement, all new residential site plans and subdivisions must be reviewed by the Brevard County School District through a completed school impact analysis (SIA). The school district reviews the SIA for adequate capacity, and must issue a capacity determination letter (CDL) regarding whether adequate school capacity exists. The city shall comply with the LOS standards outlined in the interlocal agreement which is one hundred (100) percent capacity for any and all schools, or combinations thereof, as defined in the Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 6-08. - Developments exempt from concurrency evaluation review. 
A.  The following types of developments are exempt from needing a concurrency evaluation (CE): 
1.  Remodeling or repair provided that no increase in square footage is made. 
2.  Residential accessory structures that do not increase the number of inhabitants. 
3.  Other developments which do not result in any increase in demand upon established LOS for public facilities, as determined by the administrator. 
4.  Individual single-family homes or duplexes built on existing lots as in-fill development. 
5.  Construction of projects with vested rights. 
B.  Public school concurrency. All commercial development and the following residential developments are exempt from public school CE review for public school concurrency: 
1.  Existing single family and duplex lots of record. 
2.  Any new residential development that was approved prior to the commencement date of the school concurrency program. 
3.  Any amendment to a previously-approved residential development that does not increase the total number of inhabitants. 
4.  Age restricted communities, or other residential developments with no permanent inhabitants under the age of eighteen (18). 
Section 6-09. - Administration. 
    This chapter shall be administered by the administrator. The administrator may develop such administrative rules, forms and/or applications as may be needed to implement this chapter, and shall be responsible for maintaining the cumulative records of the LOS allocations permitted. 
Section 6-10. - Proportionate fair-share program. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to mitigate the impacts of development on transportation facilities through cooperation between the public and private sectors. This section, known as the proportionate fair-share program, is required by F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
B.  Findings. 
1.  The city's proportionate fair-share program ("program") shall: 
a.  Provide a method for the impacts of development on transportation facilities to be mitigated through cooperation by the public and private sectors. 
b.  Allow applicants to proceed under certain conditions, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of a needed transportation facility. 
c.  Provide adequate public facilities for future growth and promote a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, while reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion. 
d.  Maximize the use of public funds for needed transportation facilities to serve future growth, and under certain circumstances, allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the CIE. 
e.  Be consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), and support the city's Comprehensive Plan. 
C.  Applicability. 
1.  The program must apply to all developments notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, including transportation facilities maintained by the county or state, pursuant to the requirements of subsection D. below. 
2.  The program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or those developments exempted from concurrency in the city's Comprehensive Plan, Land Development Code, and/or F.S. § 163.3180 regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts, if any. 
D.  General requirements. 
1.  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development complies with the Comprehensive Plan and LDC regulations. 
b.  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city's CIE will satisfy the requirements of the city's transportation LOS requirements. The provisions of subsections D.2. may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the city's CIE or an adopted long-term capital improvements program. 
2.  The city may allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency by contributing to an improvement that will satisfy the requirements of the city's transportation LOS requirements which is not contained in the five-year CIE or a long-term capital improvements program, where the following shall apply: 
a.  The city commission adopts an ordinance to commit to adding the improvement to the five-year CIE, or a long term capital improvements program, no later than the next annual update. To qualify for consideration, the proposed improvement must be found financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, which means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably expected to fully mitigate impacts on these facilities, in ten (10) years or less. 
b.  If the funds allocated for the five-year CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a required transportation improvement, the city may still enter into an agreement with the applicant, authorizing construction of that amount of proportionate development, if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
3.  Any project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet the design standards of the city for city streets, and those of the FDOT for state routes and highways. 
E.  Intergovernmental coordination. The city must coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the city. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
F.  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
2.  The city must not require an applicant to pay more than their proportionate fair-share. The fair market value for the impacted facilities must not differ, regardless of the method of mitigation. 
3.  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation must be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
"The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." Please see calculation method described below: 
Proportionate fair-share = [(Development trips) / (SV increase)] × Cost 
Where: Development trips = those trips from the stage/phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency. 
SV increase = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection D. 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and anticipated construction costs in the year they will be incurred. 
4.  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city must determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT work program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one (1) of the following methods: 
a.  An analysis by the city engineer of the costs involved in the project, compared to cost data from recent projects. In order to accommodate cost increases, project costs shall be adjusted by the rate of inflation for street construction costs; or 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted by urban or rural cross-section from locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined by the most current method utilized by the FDOT district. 
5.  If the city has accepted right-of-way (ROW) dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the ROW shall be valued at one hundred (100) percent of the most recent assessed market value by the city's selected property appraiser and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing, legal description, and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the ROW dedication is less than the city's estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant shall pay the difference. Prior to purchase, acquisition or donation of any real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
G.  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
1.  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that any portion of the fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local government's impact fee ordinance applicable to the project. Any impact fee credit must be approved in accordance with the procedures for such credit as established by the Brevard County Board of County Commissioners. 
2.  Except as may be required by subsection G.1. above, impact fee credits for the contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the agreement as they become due per any applicable transportation impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount pursuant to the requirements of the impact fee ordinance. 
3.  Major projects not included within the city's impact fee ordinance or created under subsections D.2.a. and b. which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the city's discretion for impact fee credits. 
4.  The proportionate obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the local impact fee ordinance. 
H.  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
1.  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant must receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a building permit within twelve (12) months or the timeframe provided in the agreement, then the agreement shall be nullified, and the applicant must reapply. 
2.  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the building permit or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the contribution shall be recalculated at the current rate of inflation at the time of payment. 
3.  All applicant improvements authorized under this article must be completed as established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. All required improvements shall be completed before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
4.  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to an agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the building permit or recording of the final plat. 
5.  Any requested change to a project subsequent to a building permit shall be subject to additional proportionate contributions should the change generate additional traffic that requires mitigation. 
6.  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the agreement at any time prior to executing the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs are nonrefundable. 
I.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
1.  Proportionate revenues must be placed in the project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city's CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the agreement. At the discretion of the city, revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the project from which the revenues were derived. Proportionate revenues may also be used as the required local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
2.  Should scheduled facility improvement be removed from the CIE, then revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor/sector to mitigate the impacts of development in accordance with subsection D.2.b. 
3.  Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, then the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions to apply proportionate fair-share and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking the applicant contributions for this purpose. 
J.  Application requirements. 
1.  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy concurrency through the program pursuant to the requirements of subsection D. 
2.  Prior to submitting an application for an agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the state highway system or Brevard County roadway network, then the FDOT and/or Brevard County will be notified and invited to participate. 
3.  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee established by the city commission by resolution and the following: 
a.  Name, address and phone number of the applicant. 
b.  Property location, including property identification numbers. 
c.  Legal description and survey of property. 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development. 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable. 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s). 
g.  Copy of concurrency application. 
4.  The administrator shall review the application and certify it is sufficient and complete within fifteen (15) business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within fifteen (15) business days of application submittal. If such deficiencies are not cured within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The city commission may, in its discretion, grant an extension not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days to cure such deficiencies, provided the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
5.  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to state transportation facilities requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit written evidence of an agreement with the FDOT for inclusion in the agreement. 
6.  When an application is deemed sufficient, the applicant shall be advised in writing and an agreement will be prepared by the applicant with direction from the city, and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including the FDOT, as required, no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the date of notice of sufficiency, and no sooner than fifteen (15) working days prior to the city commission meeting where the agreement will be considered. 
7.  The city shall notify the applicant of the date of the commission meeting where the agreement will be considered for approval. No agreement will be effective until approved by the city commission by adoption of a resolution following a duly noticed (advertised seven (7) calendar days prior to the hearing) public hearing.

ARTICLE II. - VESTED DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS 

Section 6-14. - Intent. 
    Since an approved vested rights special permit (VRSP) could have impact on the city's Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulations, this article shall not give the applicant any special rights or privileges not otherwise found to exist in a court of law or equity in the absence of this article. Should a VRSP be granted, and a building permit be issued, it shall only be done to the minimum extent necessary, to preserve and protect the legal rights of the applicant. The VRSP review process is a quasi-judicial proceeding. Further, this article and the permits and procedures set forth herein shall not be applicable to any impact fees adopted by the city. 
Section 6-15. - Vested rights special permit (VRSP.) 
A.  Application for a (VRSP). A VRSP application shall be submitted within one (1) calendar year from the effective date of adoption of any new provision(s) in either the Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Codes, which did not exist in previous versions. A VRSP may not be applied for if the provision(s) being challenged also existed in previous versions of these two (2) documents. (See application deadline in subsection G. below). Upon application and review, the city commission may grant, as a VRSP, an exception to the otherwise applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or any LDC regulations, except for any impact fees adopted by the city. Said VRSP shall specify the specific type, height, density, intensity or standard of development for a specific property. The VRSP may only be granted when the city commission finds the applicant has demonstrated that they have a pre-existing vested right to commence or complete construction on a specific development. The VRSP may be granted with or without conditions, depending upon the evidence presented. 
B.  Considerations for determination of vested rights. In determining whether a vested right exists, as deemed appropriate by any supporting evidence, the following factors shall be considered: 
1.  Was there an act or omission to act by the city which supports granting a vested right, the date of such act or omission, and the official title of the person responsible for the act or omission. 
2.  With reference to subsection B.1. above, whether the city official acted or omitted to act within the course and scope of their official position. 
3.  Did the applicant make a substantial change in position or have an investment-backed expectation, based upon an un-expired act or omission by the city including: 
a.  The nature of the applicant's change in position or investment-backed expectation. 
b.  Expenditure of money or obligation to expend funds. 
c.  The date and amount of funds spent or the date the funds were obligated. 
d.  The date of the acts committed which signify a change in position. 
4.  Good faith of the applicant in changing its position, or incurring extensive obligations and/or expenses based upon the city's actions or omissions to act. 
5.  Any physical improvements made on the property, with dates, such as grading, installation of utilities or public improvements, or any dedication of land to the city or other governmental entity, or payment of any fees, or design fees for improvements to be constructed on the site. 
6.  The acts completed by the applicant, with dates, for: applying and securing the building permit; commencing construction; and/or, completing a portion or a phase of a subdivision or building, and the percentage of work completed. 
7.  Whether applicant made contractual commitments to complete structures, deliver title thereto or occupancy thereof and the dates of and amounts of money involved in said commitment. 
8.  Whether the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution, with dates, which the applicant will be unable to meet, and whether it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet the new regulations, and be permitted to proceed with the previously permitted type, height, density, or intensity of development. 
9.  Whether enforcement of the currently effective Comprehensive Plan or any LDC regulation, claimed to defeat the applicant's right to develop a property, will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons, or leave the applicant completely unable, after thorough review of alternate solutions, to earn a reasonable return on their property investment. 
10.  Whether the applicant has a vested right to commence and complete only a portion of a proposed development on all or a portion of the applicant's property. 
11.  Whether the applicant owned an interest in the property proposed for development on the date of the change in the Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulations and that the specific type, height, density, or intensity of development proposed was lawful and permitted at that time. 
12.  Whether the applicant has continuously owned the property since the date of the change in the Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulations until the date of the public hearing before the city commission on the VRSP application. 
13.  Whether requiring the applicant's property be developed in accordance with the newly adopted Comprehensive Plan or LDC will deprive the applicant of a reasonable return on their investment or cause a substantial change in position, or otherwise unjustly deprive the applicant of their vested rights. In determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return, the following types of expenditures shall not be used in the calculation of the applicant's investment: 
a.  Expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the improvements proposed for the type, height, density, or intensity of development claimed by the applicant to be vested. 
b.  Expenditures for taxes, except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of a building permit which would not be contrary to the newly adopted Comprehensive Plan or relevant LDC regulations. 
c.  Expenditures allocated to the proposed development but which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as a necessary business expense (employee salaries, equipment rental, chattel mortgage payments) had the plan for the particular development not been formulated or a building permit not been issued, for the type, height, density, or intensity of development now claimed by the applicant to be vested. 
14.  Any other information relevant to discerning the applicant's claim to vested rights to develop their property that may be pertinent under Florida or federal law, including the existence of an imminent peril to the public health, safety, welfare, economic property, general order, or aesthetics which should preclude approval of a VRSP. 
C.  Vested rights. The right of the applicant to commence or complete construction of a type, height, density, or intensity of development, on their property, or a portion thereof, is vested, if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city commission by substantial, competent evidence that: 
1.  Any part of the currently effective Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulations have a material and adverse effect upon the applicant's vested right to develop the subject property. 
2.  By application of subsection B., the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made a substantial change in position or has an investment-backed expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence or complete a certain type, height, density, or intensity of development upon all or a portion of their property. 
3.  The fact that the property was or is in a particular zoning or land use district or classification under the currently effective, or any prior, Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulation, shall not, in and of itself, establish that an applicant's right to commence or complete construction of a certain type, height, density, or intensity of development has vested. If it is determined that there is imminent peril to the public health, safety, welfare, general order, economic prosperity, or aesthetics or that the public cost outweighs the vested right, the VRSP may be denied. 
D.  Application for a vested rights special permit (VRSP). 
1.  Any person may make application with the administrator for a VRSP to determine if the applicant's right to commence or complete construction of a specific type, height, density, or intensity on a property has been vested. Such application shall contain: 
a.  A complete recital of facts, including the nature, dates and amounts of expenditures or obligations, and any other facts or evidence which supports the claim to a vested development right. 
b.  A legal description and survey of the property where the applicant claims to have vested development rights. 
c.  The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and any representatives. 
d.  Legal evidence demonstrating the applicant has held title to the property from the date the Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulation change became effective, and a description of the extent and quality of ownership. 
e.  An affidavit under penalty of perjury verified and executed before a notary public as to the legitimacy of the application and all attachments. 
f.  Such other information or evidence relevant to the property or application as may be requested by the administrator. 
2.  Application fee. The fee shall be as established by resolution by the city commission. 
E.  Planning board review . A public hearing shall be held by the planning board (PB) on the application for a VRSP. City staff shall forward the PB findings, recommendations and evidentiary record to the city commission and applicant based on the following procedures: 
1.  Function . The PB is authorized to hear, receive and create an evidentiary record of a hearing held on applications for a VRSP. The PB will prepare a recommendation of approval or denial and forward the evidentiary record to the city commission on all applications for a VRSP based on the terms of the regulations or restrictions of the LDC, Florida Statute and such other authority as presented at the hearing. 
a.  After a public hearing is held, the PB will make a written report of its recommendation in accordance with these rules and procedures, and provide a copy of the report of decision by either electronic means or hard copy, to all parties of record, appropriate city staff and the city commission. 
b.  The PB will provide for a court reporter at a public hearing held on a VRSP, in order to create an evidentiary record for the city commission. At a minimum, a summary of testimonies will be provided in the report of decision itself or as a separate document in addition thereto. Transcripts will be provided only upon request. Individuals making the request must bear the costs of transcription. 
c.  The PB shall keep indexed records of all meetings, agendas, findings, determinations and reports of decision. Such records shall be public records. 
d.  Attendance at hearings. All persons will be heard. The PB shall request staff members with personal knowledge of relevant facts to attend hearings and produce relevant documents. 
e.  Meetings. Meetings for the purpose of holding quasi-judicial public hearings shall be scheduled and noticed a minimum of ten (10) days in advance in the newspaper. Interested parties are entitled to a fair opportunity to be heard in person and through counsel, to have an opportunity to rebut the case against their interests and to be heard fully before any decision is reached. Disclosure of ex-parte communications, all witnesses to be sworn and the allowance of fact-based public testimony are all required. The parties may present evidence, cross-examine witnesses and be informed of all of the facts. The PB will create a record showing due process, evidence of sufficient quality and quantity to fulfill the substantial competent evidence standard. 
2.  Considerations . 
a.  In reaching its recommendation of approval or denial and the creation of the evidentiary record, the PB must consider the following criteria, as well as any other issues that are pertinent and reasonable: 
1.  City staff recommendations, including the staff report and attachments; 
2.  Testimony from the applicant; 
3.  Testimony from the public; 
4.  The City of Cocoa Beach's Comprehensive Plan; 
5.  The City of Cocoa Beach's LDC and this chapter; 
6.  Any other applicable city ordinances or city codes; 
7.  Florida Statute and other offered authorities; 
8.  Judicially recognized standards of equitable estoppel if applicable; 
9.  Whether the VRSP is of a nature properly brought before the PB for an evidentiary hearing and recommendation to the city commission; and, 
10.  The plain and ordinary meaning of all applicable city ordinance or code provisions, unless the language is unclear or ambiguous then the intent of the ordinance or code provision applied or interpreted may be considered. 
3.  Findings . All decisions of the PB concerning a VRSP will be in the form of a recommendation to the city commission. Before preparing a recommendation to the city commission on a VRSP, the PB must find that: 
a.  The VRSP process has allowed landowners the opportunity and venue to exercise their claims as to vested rights or privileges. 
b.  The applicant has either proved or not proved entitlement to a VRSP by factual representations and/or by demonstrating compliance with this LDC, and any other code. 
c.  In reaching a recommendation, the PB may attach conditions necessary for the protection of the health, safety, comfort, convenience and welfare of the general public. The conditions must be rationally related to the vested rights determination and the potential impacts of the request on surrounding uses. 
4.  Authority. The PB serves as the quasi-judicial evidentiary review board in an advisory capacity to the city commission with respect to all VRSP applications. 
5.  Review of decisions . The PB issues a recommendation of approval or denial and prepares an evidentiary record for the city commission's review. 
F.  City commission review . 
1.  At the VRSP public hearing before the city commission, only a participant or his representative at the proceedings before the PB will be afforded the right to address the city commission and may address the commission only as to the correctness of findings of fact or conclusions of law contained in the record, or to allege the discovery of relevant new evidence which was not known by the speaker at the time of the hearing before the PB and not otherwise disclosed in the record. The city commission may question its staff, its attorneys and any participant who is present about matters contained in the written record and points of law or procedure. 
2.  The city commission will receive the evidentiary record from the PB and consider; the substantive recommendation of the PB; the evidence and testimony included with the PB's recommendation and testimony received during public hearing before the commission. 
3.  The city commission may approve the request, deny the request or remand the case for further proceedings before the PB. 
4.  In reaching its decision, the commission may, but is not required to, adopt the PB's recommendation, staff's recommendation, or the applicant's recommendation. 
5.  The commission may render its own decision based on competent substantial evidence presented in the evidentiary record or any relevant new evidence presented to them. 
6.  Unless otherwise provided by the commission, a decision to adopt the recommendation by the PB, applicant, or staff will include the written findings, conclusions, and conditions provided in the applicable recommendation. 
G.  Application deadline. A person shall have one (1) calendar year after the effective date of adoption of the Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Codes to file an application for a VRSP. Failure to make such application by the deadline shall waive any potential vested development right. 
    Although the one (1) year time period may have lapsed, in the opinion of the aggrieved person or legal entity, any person or legal entity who believes that its vested rights may be abrogated by any provision in the Comprehensive Plan or by a LDC regulation must, prior to seeking judicial relief, first file a complete application for a vested rights permit so that a determination can be made whether the one (1) year application deadline has actually passed and whether other provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or LDC regulations may preserve the applicant's vested rights.

Section 6-18. - Expiration of variances, special exceptions and waivers issued prior to March 3, 2016. 
A.  All variances, special exceptions, or waivers, approved by the city prior to March 3, 2016, which by the terms thereof required some action by the recipient in order to implement the land use or regulatory relief granted, shall expire six (6) months after the effective date of adoption of these Land Development Codes, unless the recipient obtains a valid building permit, based upon and incorporating the specific approval within the aforesaid six-month time period, and the recipient commences and diligently pursues work thereon without cessation of thirty (30) days or more. 
B.  Any person whose variance, special exception, permit or waiver will be expiring by the terms of this section may appeal within six (6) months of the effective date of adoption of these Land Development Codes, but in no event shall such appeal be filed later than six (6) months after March 1, 2016.

ARTICLE IV. - NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES 

Section 6-21. - Legal nonconforming lots, structures and uses. 
    Within the districts established by these regulations and/or amendments thereto, there exist lots, structures, and uses which were lawful before these regulations were adopted but which would be classified as nonconforming under these current LDC regulations. These lots, structures and uses are classified as legal nonconforming. 
    These legal nonconformities shall be permitted to continue until they are removed, but will be replaced with structures and uses which are in compliance with current LDC regulations. 
    Structures which are legal nonconforming may be maintained and upgraded. These structures may be expanded or extended only in such a manner that will not increase the nonconformity and will not cause any other nonconformity to occur. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these regulations shall require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building which was deemed by the administrator to be under construction prior to the adoption or amendment of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1623, 2(Exh. A), 6-7-2018) 
Section 6-22. - Rebuilding. 
    The City Charter allows rebuilding above current height and density limitations to legally nonconforming structures, and only as follows: 
A.  Density for damaged buildings . No owners of dwelling units destroyed or substantially damaged by explosion, fire, flood, wind, erosion, or other disaster shall be denied the right to either rebuild or to raze and rebuild to the same number of dwelling units in the same location. (See City Charter, section 6.01 below) 
City Charter - Sec. 6.01. - Residential density limits. No part of the City of Cocoa Beach shall be zoned to a residential density greater than ten (10) dwelling units per acre for permanent occupancy dwellings, or twenty-eight (28) units per acre for transient accommodations (motels, hotels). There shall be no fractional weighting of dwelling units. The city commission may grant a variance to individual parcels upon petition and proof that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this section would result in unnecessary hardship. To grant such a variance, the city commission must make findings of fact that the petitioner has met the legal standards for variance set forth in the City of Cocoa Beach Code of Ordinances, and the variance must be approved by a concurring vote of four (4) members of the city commission after due notice and public hearing. A request for variance will be considered after a written petition is submitted to the city commission indicating the grounds on which the variance is sought. After the petitioner has submitted a sufficient petition, the request must be scheduled for public hearing before the city commission as expeditiously as possible, but not earlier than thirty (30) days from the day of submission of a sufficient petition. Notice and hearing requirements for such variance shall be in accordance with the provisions for such variance as set forth in the City of Cocoa Beach Code of Ordinances. Transient accommodations shall not be converted to permanent occupancy at densities exceeding the limits of this section. Except as provided for in section 6.09 of the [City] Charter or as set forth below, structures if razed shall be replaced only by structures which, if residential, conform to density limits of this section. No owners of dwelling units destroyed or substantially damaged by explosion, fire, flood, wind, erosion, or other disaster shall be denied the right either to rebuild or to raze and rebuild to the same number of dwelling units in the same location. 
B.  Height for damaged buildings . No owners of structures destroyed or substantially damaged by explosion, fire, flood, wind, erosion, or other disaster shall be denied the right to either rebuild or to raze and rebuild to the same height in the same location. (See City Charter, section 6.04 below) 
City Charter - Sec. 6.04. - Building height limit. No structure, no part of any structure, and no attachment to any structure shall be erected to a height greater than forty-five (45) feet above crown of abutting road. Structures, if razed, shall be replaced only by structures which conform to the height limits of this section. No owners of structures destroyed or substantially damaged by explosion, fire, flood, wind, erosion, or other disaster shall be denied the right either to rebuild or to raze and rebuild to the same height in the same location. The city commission may grant a variance to individual parcels upon petition and proof that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this section would result in unnecessary hardship. To grant such a variance, the city commission must make findings of fact that the petitioner has met the legal standards for variance as set forth in the City of Cocoa Beach Code of Ordinances, and the variance must be approved by a concurring vote of four (4) members of the city commission after due notice and public hearing. A request for variance will be considered after a written petition is submitted to the city commission indicating the grounds on which the variance is sought. After the petitioner has submitted a sufficient petition, the request must be scheduled for public hearing before the city commission as expeditiously as possible, and not earlier than thirty (30) days from the day of submission of a sufficient petition. Notice and hearing requirements for such variance shall be in accordance with the provisions for variance set forth in the City of Cocoa Beach Code of Ordinances. 
C.  Non-casualty rebuilding . Residential and non-residential structures may be razed and rebuilt to their existing height and density as previously provided in subsections B. and C. above, to same extent as if they were lost to a casualty event. (See City Charter, section 6.09 below.) 
City Charter - Sec. 6.09. - Non casualty loss rebuild. Residential and non-residential structures may be razed and rebuilt to their existing height and density as previously provided to same extent as if they were lost to a casualty event, and as may be provided in the city Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 6-23. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    Where a lot area or frontage does not conform with these regulations, but was a lot of record on or before June 9, 1960, such lot may be used for the permitted uses, accessory uses and special exceptions granted for the zoning district where it exists, providing all other provisions of the district are met. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots under same ownership. 
    If any portion of two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots with continuous frontage under single ownership existed on or before June 9, 1960, which do not meet these regulations for lot width and area, these lots shall be considered to be an undivided parcel and no portion of said parcel shall be used, divided or sold, which does not meet the minimum lot width and area requirements of these regulations. 
Section 6-24. - Grounds for the discontinuation and/or removal of a nonconformity. 
A.  When a nonconforming lot, structure or use is changed, discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three-year period from the date of abandonment, the nonconformity shall not thereafter continue and it shall be permanently discontinued. Moving forward, said lot, structure or use shall be in conformance with these LDC regulations in the zoning district where it exists. 
B.  When a portion of a nonconforming structure is removed or demolished to an extent which exceeds more than fifty (50) percent of the current replacement cost of the entire structure, as determined by a cost estimate provided by a contractor licensed to do said work, and as approved by the administrator, said structure, if reconstructed, shall be done so in full conformance with current city and building codes. 
Section 6-25. - Nonconforming building repairs and maintenance. 
    A building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, or any nonconforming structure may receive normal repairs and maintenance during any calendar year to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the building, provided that the interior square and cubic footage of the building is not increased. 
    Nothing in these regulations shall prevent the strengthening or restoring of a building or part thereof which has been declared to be unsafe by a city building official or fire marshal. 
Section 6-26. - Unlawful or casual use not grounds for nonconforming status. 
    It is the intent of these regulations to not continue a nonconforming lot, structure or use. Casual, temporary or illegal use of a lot, structure or use shall not be sufficient to set a precedent or establish the existence of a nonconforming use or to create rights for the continuance of such use.

CHAPTER VII - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND FLOOD CONTROL  
ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
 
Section 7-1. - Stormwater management requirements. 
All development, as defined in section 1-20 of this Land Development Code, shall be in compliance with this chapter and with the provisions required by the City Code of Ordinances chapter 28. Any redevelopment or renovation project that requires the modification of an existing site, with respect to ground elevations and grading, shall conform to all drainage requirements of these regulations. 
A.  The discharge of stormwater, into the city stormwater management system or any waterway, that contains pollutants, such as, but not limited to, paints, oils, fertilizers, yard waste, garbage or discarded objects is prohibited. 
B.  All runoff shall be first diverted to retention facilities which shall have a minimum volume of: 
1.  One (1) inch times the square footage of the property for a site of less than one hundred (100) acres, or 
2.  This minimum volume shall be calculated at a level, at least one (1) foot above the highest wet water table. 
C.  All retention facilities shall incorporate designs which will provide for percolation, recovery and other pertinent factors, as required by the St. Johns River Water Management District. 
D.  All retention facilities shall incorporate designs in compliance with the Cocoa Beach Standard Construction Details. 
E.  In addition to meeting the retention requirements, the project shall have detention capacity sufficient to ensure that post development runoff will not exceed predevelopment runoff for a ten-year, twenty-four-hour storm event. Hydrograph analysis for this purpose shall be based on realistic and applicable methods for time of concentration of less than fifteen (15) minutes. 
F.  In all cases, outfall from retention/detention facilities must be connected by approved means to the city storm drainage system. Where the outfall cannot be connected to the city storm drainage system, stormwater management shall be designed according to the criteria established by the city engineer. In any event no overflow through the city curb and gutter or street system (overland) shall be permitted. 
G.  An exfiltration or porous pavement system may be designed in lieu of a retention/detention system. The design shall be based on the criteria set by the city engineer who will take into account the size and type of the project, soil and water table conditions, impact on the surrounding area, and other applicable conditions. 
H.  Final stormwater storage locations shall not impound water against roadway or building structural sections. 
I.  Side slopes for retention/detention areas shall have at least a ratio of three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical. 
J.  Floodways and floodplains, levels of flood flows or velocities, of adjacent streams, impoundments or other watercourses must not be altered so as to adversely impact the off-site storage or conveyance capacities of the water resources.

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
 
Section 7-10. - General. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the floodplain management chapter of the City of Cocoa Beach. 
B.  Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
C.  Intent. The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
D.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
E.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter. 
F.  Disclaimer of liability. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Commission of the City of Cocoa Beach or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1627, § 2(Att.), 3-7-2019)  
Section 7-11. - Applicability. 
A.  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
B.  Areas to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Cocoa Beach, as established in subsection C of this section. 
C.  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The flood insurance study for Brevard County, Florida and incorporated areas dated March 17, 2014, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the Development Services Department, 2 S. Orlando Ave., Cocoa Beach. 
D.  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 7-14 of this chapter the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the flood plain administrator indicates that ground elevations: 
1.  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this chapter and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
2.  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
E.  Other laws. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
F.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This chapter shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter. 
G.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(Ord. No. 1627, § 2(Att.), 3-7-2019)  
Section 7-27. - Other development. 
A.  General requirements for other development. All development, including manmade changes to improved or unimproved real estate for which specific provisions are not specified in this chapter or the Florida Building Code, shall: 
1.  Be located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
2.  Meet the limitations of section 7-23 of this chapter if located in a regulated floodway; 
3.  Be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design flood; 
4.  Be constructed of flood damage-resistant materials; and 
5.  Have mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems above the design flood elevation, except that minimum electric service required to address life safety and electric code requirements is permitted below the design flood elevation provided it conforms to the provisions of the electrical part of building code for wet locations. 
B.  Fences in regulated floodways. Fences in regulated floodways that have the potential to block the passage of floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences, shall meet the limitations of section 7-23 of this chapter.
