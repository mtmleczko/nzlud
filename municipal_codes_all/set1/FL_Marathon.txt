PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Marathon, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Kyle S. Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to the city staff, both past and present, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

If, at any time during the fiscal year, it appears probable to the city manager that the revenues available will be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, the city manager shall report same to the council without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial action taken, and recommendations as to any other steps that should be taken. The council shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and, for that purpose, the council may by resolution reduce one or more appropriations accordingly. 
(c)  Limitations; effective date . No appropriation for debt service may be reduced or transferred, and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount required by law to be appropriated, or by more than the unencumbered balance thereof.

Within 20 days after an initiative petition or a referendum petition is filed with the city clerk proposing an ordinance or other measure by initiative petition, the city clerk shall in coordination with the office of the Supervisor of Elections, examine all signatures on the petition to determine the number of electors of the municipality who signed the petition. If the city clerk determines that 10% or more of the total number of electors registered to vote in the last regular city election have signed the initiative petition, the city clerk shall, after ten (10) days, transmit a certified copy of the text of the proposed ordinance or measure to the city council together with a statement attesting to the number of such electors who signed the petition.

All bids shall be received in the City Manager's office on, or before, the date and time set forth in the notice. 
(c)  Bid opening procedure; awarding of bids. 
(1)  Sealed bids shall be opened by the City Manager or his appointed representative in the presence of two (2) witnesses; one (1) of which will be the City Clerk or the Clerk's appointed representative. The opening of the sealed bids shall be recorded by the City Clerk or the Clerk's representative at the date and time specified in the bid proposal. The names of the witnesses and of the City Manager or his appointed representative together with a copy of the bid proposal and the date and time of the opening of the bids shall be filed with the City Clerk. 
(2)  Whenever required by the bid proposal, all bid bonds, cash, insurance, checks or other security accompanying the bid shall be received and maintained for safekeeping by the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall be responsible for the return of the bid bonds, cash, insurance, checks or other security of unsuccessful bidders. 
(3)  Upon completion of the bid opening and reading, all bids received will be deposited with the City Manager or his designee for tabulation and/or recommendation to the City Council. 
(4)  Upon submission of the bid tabulation and recommendation to the City Manager or City Council, as the case may be, the City Manager or the City Council shall accept, reject or refer for additional review the bid tabulation and recommendation. 
(5)  The award of a bid will not have the same effect as the award of a contract. The award of a bid will signify the selection of a vendor with which the City will negotiate a contract. In the event that negotiations between the City and that vendor are unsuccessful, the City will thereafter negotiate with the next bidder on the recommended list created by the City Manager. 
(d)  Cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals. An invitation for bids, or request for proposals, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole, or in part, as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is in the best interests of the City. The reasons therefore shall be made part of the contract file. Each solicitation issued by the City shall state that the solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected, in whole or in part, in the best interests of the City. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all businesses solicited. The notice shall identify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation and, where appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any resolicitation or any future procurement of similar items. 
(e)  Correction or withdrawal of bids; cancellation of awards. In general, bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this chapter. However, correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted, where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified, or the bid may be withdrawn by written or telegraphic notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City, or fair competition, shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: 
(1)  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document, but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or 
(2)  The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the Purchasing Agent. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Council shall have the authority to waive any and all irregularities in any and all proposals.

Sec. 2-179. - Award. 
(a)  All contracts shall be awarded by the City Manager or City Council, as the case may be, as stated above, to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. In addition to price, there shall be considered the following: 
(1)  The capacity, ability and skill of the provider to perform the contract; 
(2)  Whether the provider can perform the contract within the time specified without delay or interference; 
(3)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the provider; 
(4)  Professional licensure required when service of a skilled nature as required by law to perform such service and/or skill; 
(5)  The quality of performance of previous contracts; 
(6)  The previous and existing compliance by the provider with laws and ordinances relating to the contract; 
(7)  The ability of the provider regarding future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
(8)  The City Manager may, by administrative order, establish a set of criteria of a numerical nature that may be utilized in awarding contracts hereunder. 
(b)  The contract shall be awarded by the City Manager or the City Council, as the case may be, with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. 
(c)  In the event the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid for a project exceeds available funds, and the City Council does not make available additional funds, the City Manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of bids, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price as long as the scope of work is not changed with the lowest, most responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. Final negotiation shall be in written form as approved by the City Manager. 
(d)  The City retains the right to reject all bids should negotiations fail. This negotiation may not be used to ascertain the lowest responsive and responsible bid. 
(e)  Until a formal contract is executed, the City reserves the right to reject all bids. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014)

    If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the City Manager or the Purchasing Agent. Grounds for determination of nonresponsibility may include, but are not limited to, the unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to nonresponsibility. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the nonresponsible bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be a public record. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014) 
Sec. 2-181. - One response. 
    If only one (1) responsive bid or proposal for commodity or contractual service is received in response to an invitation for bid/proposal, an award may be made to the single bidder/proposer, if the City Manager finds the price submitted is fair and reasonable and that other prospective bidders had reasonable opportunity to respond, or there is not adequate time for resolicitation. Further, the City Manager reserves the right, if it is in the best interests of the City, to negotiate with the sole bidder/proposer for the best terms, conditions and price. The City Manager shall document the reasons that such action is in the best interest of the City. Otherwise, the bid/proposal may be rejected and: 
(1)  New bids or offers may be solicited; 
(2)  The sole bid/proposal may be rejected; 
(3)  If the City Manager determines in writing that the need for the supply or service continues but that the price of the one (1) bid/proposal is unreasonable and there is not time for resolicitation or resolicitation would likely be futile, the procurement may then be conducted under Subsection 2-184(6), as appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014) 
Sec. 2-182. - Bidding documentation to remain property of City. 
    All bids and accompanying documentation received from bidders in response to the invitation to bid shall become the property of the City and will not be returned to the bidders. In the event of contract award, all documentation and work product produced as part of the contract shall become the exclusive property of the City. This section is applicable to request for proposal and request for letter of interest documents, which also become property of the City.

Sec. 2-183. - Waiver of competitive bidding procedures. 
    The City Council may authorize at a public meeting after majority vote the waiver of competitive bidding procedures upon the recommendation of the City Manager that it is in the City's best interest to do so, to obtain goods and services which cannot be acquired through the normal purchasing process due to insufficient time, the nature of the goods or services, or other factors. Purchases authorized by waiver process shall be acquired after conducting a good faith review of available sources and negotiation as to price, delivery and terms. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014)

As soon as practicable, a record of each emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the amount and type of the contract, a listing of the item(s) procured under the contract, and the identification number of the contract file. Emergency purchases are further discussed in Subsection (8) herein below. 
(5)  Under circumstances where time constraints do not permit the preparation of clearly drawn specifications or situations where, after competitive bidding, no bids meeting bid requirements are received, all compliant bids received are too high, or all bids are rejected for failure to meet bid requirements (i.e., bids are noncompliant). 
(6)  Supplies, equipment or services available from a sole source only may be exempted from the bidding requirements of this chapter by the City Manager upon the filing of a written request by a department head to the City Manager outlining the conditions and circumstances involved, after conducting a good faith review of available sources, finding that there is only one source for the required supply, brand, service, or construction item capable of fulfilling the needs of the City. The City Manager or purchasing agent shall conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to price, delivery, and terms.

As indicated in Subsection 2-177(d), the City Manager is hereby authorized to use his discretion to approve change orders with respect to the utility project in amounts not to exceed $35,000.00 to address emergencies of unforeseen problems that occur between the City Council meetings which would stop or significantly delay the progress of the project provided, however, that this change order shall receive after-the-fact approval at the next scheduled Council meeting. Otherwise, in the event of an emergency situation which requires the immediate purchase of goods or supplies, the following procedures will apply: 
1.  A state of emergency must be declared by either the President of the United States or the Governor of Florida or Monroe County.

Sec. 2-185. - Contract administration.

(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014) 
Sec. 2-186. - Purchase orders and check requests. 
(a)  Purchase orders. A purchase order is required for purchases of any equipment, materials or contractual services whose cost is in excess of $5,000.00. A purchase order represents both a request to acquire an item and the form on which to record the required authorizations. Purchase orders should be used whenever possible, as check requests are for purchases that have already been made. In those instances where a vendor will not accept a purchase order as a commitment of the City, a check request should be used. The originating department will be responsible for completely and accurately preparing the purchase order. This should include the following: 
(1)  Complete name and address of the vendor and vendor number, if known. 
(2)  Date prepared. 
(3)  A description of the item(s) purchased in sufficient detail for adequate identification. 
(4)  The account number(s) and amount(s) to be charged and the total amount of the purchase order. 
(5)  The signature of the appropriate department director. 
    After the purchase order has been properly prepared, it must be signed by the appropriate department head and by the City Manager. Purchase orders charged to more than one (1) department must have the signature of all department heads affected. 
    After the purchase order has been prepared, the originating department shall send the purchase order to the Finance Department for review and approval. When a purchase order is received in the Finance Department, it will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness and verification that there are sufficient funds remaining in the budget. After all information has been checked, the Finance Department will authorize the purchase order by issuing a purchase order number. 
    Once all required authorizations have been obtained, the Finance Department will retain the original to enter into the accounts payable system and return a copy to the originating department. All open purchase orders will be shown as "encumbrances" of the account number(s) charged. Once paid, the encumbrance will be deleted and shown as an expenditure/expense on the monthly expenditure reports. 
    A purchase order will then be given to the vendor or supplier. Once the items have been received and accepted by the City, the invoice shall be signed indicating receipt and, along with all the other relevant supporting documentation, should be attached to a copy of the purchase order and forwarded to the Finance Department. Another copy of the purchase order should be retained in the originating department's files for auditing purposes. The Finance Department will verify that all required supporting documentation is attached including evidence that the items have actually been received and accepted by the City, that the correct account number(s) and amount(s) have been charged, and the information contained on the invoice agrees with the purchase order. Any differences or discrepancies between the purchase order and invoice must be documented and reconciled before payment will be made. The Finance Department will then initial the purchase order and process payment to the vendor. 
(b)  Check requests. A check request form records required authorization for disbursement of City funds. Check request forms should be used for, but are not limited to, the purchase and/or payment of seminar and conference registrations, travel expenses, payments for contractual services under existing contracts (such as maintenance contracts), professional services under approved contracts, minor office or operating supplies or similar types of transactions. Routine items such as utility bills (water, electric, and phone) do not require a check request. These items should be coded with the appropriate account number, approved by an authorized signer, and then forwarded to the Finance Department. The originating department will be responsible for completely and accurately preparing the check request. This should include the following: 
(1)  Complete name and address of the vendor and the vendor number if known. 
(2)  Date prepared and date check is required. 
(3)  A description of the items purchased in sufficient detail for adequate identification. 
(4)  The account number(s) and amount(s) to be charged and total amount of the check request. 
(5)  If the check request is for a purchase of more than $5,000.00, evidence of three (3) quotes must be attached and the City Manager must approve. 
(6)  If the check request is for a purchase of less than $5,000.00, written justification must be included. 
(7)  If the check request is for a reimbursement, all required receipts must be attached. 
(8)  The authorized signature of the appropriate department director. 
(9)  If the vendor is a sole source, the check request must be approved if over $5,000.00, in addition to all other required approvals, by the City Manager. 
(10)  An invoice, along with packing slip, delivery receipt, or other appropriate documentation must be attached to the check request. Documentation must also include the initials or signature of the person verifying that the items have been received and accepted by the City if other documentation is not available and the account numbers to be charged. 
    After the department head has approved and signed the check request, it is then sent to the Finance Department for review and approval. Departments shall keep a copy of all check requests for review and fiscal/budgetary control purposes. 
    The Finance Department shall review the check request for accuracy and completeness, and is responsible for verifying that: 
(1)  All required documentation supporting the check request is attached. 
(2)  Supporting documentation that the items have been received and accepted by the City. 
(3)  The correct account number(s) and amount(s) have been charged. 
(4)  There are sufficient funds remaining in the line item(s) budget(s) to make the purchase. 
(5)  The check request has been authorized for payment as indicated in Section 2-178. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15, § 2, 10-14-2014; Ord. No. 2015-04 , § 2, 4-28-2015) 
Sec. 2-187. - Ethics in public contracting. 
    In addition to all ethical rules and guidelines set forth by the State of Florida, the Code of the City of Marathon, Monroe County Code, if any and as applicable to the City of Marathon, the City Manager may impose any one (1) or more of the following sanctions on a City employee for violations of ethical standards including, but not limited to, oral or written warnings or reprimands, suspension with or without pay for specified periods of time or termination of employment. For nonemployees, for violations of ethical standards, the City Council may terminate any contract with the City of Marathon.

Unless determined by a veterinarian to be diseased or in pain, an animal may not be destroyed during the first five (5) working days after impoundment. In addition, an animal may not be adopted out or released to anyone other than its owner during the first five (5) working days after impoundment.

If probable cause exists, the Department Manager or a sworn animal control officer shall commence prosecution of the offense pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 828.27(1)(f). 
(c)  Punishment. Upon conviction, any person violating this chapter shall be punished as provided by law. Each day during which the violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

(1)  Any valid permit, for which construction has commenced, must progress in a timely fashion. The only method by which timely valid progress of authorized work may be shown is through the Building Department's having performed and approved an inspection within 180 days measured from either of: 
a.  As to the initial inspection, the date work was required to begin; or 
b.  As to inspections subsequent to the initial inspection, from the date of the last approved inspection. 
Those inspections, as amended from time to time, may include, but shall not be limited to, any auger/auger cap, piling/piling cap, grade beam/slab, columns/tie beams, slab/wood floor, roof trusses/sheathing, final roofing, A/C ductwork, total rough plumbing, total rough electrical, framing, insulation/drywall, final mechanical, final plumbing, final electrical and final building. 
(2)  Any permit whose progress fails to meet the "required inspection within 180 days" requirement shall automatically expire, and any further activity shall require a new application, appropriate deposits and any other application review fees, and a valid allocation award in accordance with the Dwelling Unit Allocation Ordinance or other building permit allocation system adopted by the City in the future. 
(3)  Any expired permit that is reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter will be subject to the edition of the Florida Building Code that is in effect at the time the reinstated permit is issued, and all work in place and all work required to complete the structure must meet all applicable regulations in effect at the time the expired permit is reinstated. 
(d)  Commencement of work or development. 
(1)  As used in this chapter, commencement of work or development shall entail: 
a.  Receipt of a building permit and first inspection approval; or 
b.  The initiation of significant site improvements such that the improvements would only permit the development authorized by the building permit of the approved project, and any other pattern of development would require extensive changes to the installed improvement. 
(2)  Commencement of work or development shall not consist of: 
a.  The dividing of land into parcels; 
b.  Demolition of a structure; 
c.  Deposit of refuse, solid or liquid waste, or fill on the parcel, unless the building permit is exclusively and specifically for such; or 
d.  The clearing of land. 
(e)  Final exterior inspection. As used in this section, the term "final exterior inspection" means completion of all work related to the exterior footprint of the structure, including, but not limited to, all exterior finishes, enclosures, porches, patios, screened areas, walkways, driveways, landscaping, or stormwater management. In order to obtain an approved final exterior inspection, every aspect of permitted exterior work shall be completed and approved in accordance with the permit drawings. 
(f)  Variances to time limitations. 
(1)  The Building Official may grant a one-time, 90-day administrative extension of any time limitations set forth in this section, provided that the permit holder has not previously deferred acceptance of the allocation award of the building permit subject to the extension under section 107.04 C.1. of the Marathon Land Development Regulations. 
(2)  In addition, the City Manager, or designee, may grant a variance to the time limitations set forth herein upon a demonstration and finding that the enforcement of this section would constitute a severe and undue hardship upon the permit holder. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the enforcement of this section would constitute a severe and undue hardship. Severe and undue hardship may include, but is not limited to the following: 
a.  Death or incapacity of an owner or immediate family member of the owner; 
b.  Destruction of the permitted improvements, of no less than 50 percent of the value of the permitted improvements, by an act of God or hazard (e.g., fire, windstorm, flood); or 
c.  Work stoppage due to bankruptcy, or bona fide financial hardship as determined by the City Manager or his designee, of an owner or construction lender or due to an order issued by a government agency, when the order did not result from the owner or builder's violation of a law, code, regulations, or conditions set forth in the development order. 
The relief granted under this subsection shall be limited to a time extension not to exceed 90 days and shall be further limited to the minimum extension necessary to obviate the demonstrated hardship. 
Any variance request made under this subsection shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $250.00. 
(3)  If the City Manager, or designee, does not grant a variance, or if such a variance is granted, but the applicant seeks a further variance due to a severe and undue hardship, then the applicant may apply for a variance from City Council. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the enforcement of this section would constitute a severe and undue hardship. Severe and undue hardship may include, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  Death or incapacity of an owner or immediate family member of the owner; 
b.  Destruction of the permitted improvements, of no less than 50 percent of the value of the permitted improvements, by an act of God or hazard (e.g., fire, windstorm, flood); or 
c.  Work stoppage due to bankruptcy, or bona fide financial hardship as determined by the City Manager or his designee, of an owner or construction lender or due to an order issued by a government agency, when the order did not result from the owner or builder's violation of a law, code, regulations, or conditions set forth in the development order. 
    The relief granted under this subsection shall be limited to a time extension not to exceed 90 days and shall be further limited to the minimum extension necessary to obviate the demonstrated hardship. If City Council grants a variance, it may, in its sole discretion, require the permit holder to immediately pay a deposit to the City in the amount of ten (10) percent of the most recent total market value of the parcel, as determined by data from the Monroe County Property Appraiser. The variance shall not be effective until the deposit has been paid. The variance shall be held in a non-interest-bearing escrow account. If a certificate of occupancy is not issued by the date the variance expires, then the deposit shall be forfeited to the City. The discretionary deposit requirement shall not apply to any permits that are issued under the market rate owner-occupied allocation pool provided for in the City's Land Development Regulations. 
    Any variance request made under this subsection shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $250.00. If a variance issued under this subsection includes the requirement of a ten (10) percent deposit and such deposit is not paid within 15 days, then the variance shall become null and void.

Sec. 6-55. - Fees and permitting requirements for work done without a permit. 
(a)  When any construction work is undertaken by any person, firm or corporation for any structure, as that term is defined in Chapter 9.5 of the 1984 Code, without a building permit where a permit is required, then the person, firm or corporation shall pay according to a fee schedule adopted by resolution of the City Council. The payment of such a fee shall neither relieve the person, firm or corporation of fully complying with all other relevant City regulations, City ordinances or State statutes nor of any penalties prescribed therein. Unless otherwise exempt by ordinance, an after-the-fact building permit shall only be issued to a State or City certified or licensed contractor, or owner-builder. No after-the-fact permit shall be issued to an architect or engineer unless he is also a State or City certified or licensed contractor. 
(b)  Before any permit may be issued under this section, the person, firm or corporation seeking the permit shall, at his own expense, provide the City Manager or designee with the following: 
(1)  Drawings sealed by an engineer licensed to practice in the State of Florida which certify that all work already done is in compliance with the applicable building code. 
(2)  A certification from an engineer licensed in the State of Florida that all steel work is in compliance with the applicable building code and relevant State law and that such compliance has been verified through generally accepted engineering practice. Compliance with the engineer's certification requirements of this subsection shall neither relieve the person, firm or corporation of fully complying with all other relevant City regulations, City ordinances or State statutes, nor from any penalties prescribed therein. 
(c)  In lieu of the above, the person, firm or corporation may remove all unpermitted work and return the site to its original condition. A demolition permit shall be required for all commercial work (regardless of value) and for residential work when the fair market value of the unpermitted work is $1,000.00 or more. 
(d)  The City will not issue a building permit for construction work under Subsections (a) or (b) of this section, if land clearing in excess of that permittable was performed, until the requirements of Chapter 9.5 of the 1984 Code are met. 
(e)  In the event the construction work is unpermittable under the City Code, the site shall be restored to its original condition. If demolition is required, a demolition permit shall be obtained for all commercial work (regardless of value) and for residential work if the fair market value of the unpermitted work is $1,000.00 or more. If land clearing was performed, the site shall be restored pursuant to Chapter 9.5 of the 1984 Code. 
(f)  An appeal from any administrative decision made by the City Manager or designee in enforcing this section shall be pursuant to Section 9.5-521 of the 1984 Code. 
(Ord. No. 2003-25, § 1(art. 1, div. 2), 12-23-2003; Ord. No. 2010-03, § 2, 2-23-2010) 
Sec. 6-56. - Work concealed prior to inspection. 
    If any work is concealed before an inspection has been made and the work approved, the work must either be exposed, inspected and approved, or an architect's or engineer's certification that the concealed work is in conformance with the appropriate code shall be provided to the Building Official before any further work at the site may continue. 
(Ord. No. 2003-25, § 1(art. 1, div. 2), 12-23-2003) 
Sec. 6-57. - Inspections. 
    All inspections shall be made by City building inspectors unless the City Manager or designee issues an approval allowing for inspections to be conducted by professional architects or engineers. Special inspection approval must be obtained by executing and submitting to the Building Department an "Application for Special Inspections" and said approval must be obtained prior to the inspections being conducted. 
(Ord. No. 2003-25, § 1(art. 1, div. 2), 12-23-2003) 
Sec. 6-58. - Expiration of building permit. 
(a)  If work has commenced under a building permit and the permit becomes null and void or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, except as provided in Subsection (b) or (c), the contractor or owner builder who was issued the building permit shall be prohibited from obtaining any additional building permits. 
(b)  The prohibitions in this section shall not apply, and the Building Official shall issue a new permit to a contractor, if: 
(1)  The contractor and the property owner are involved in litigation concerning the work authorized by the expired permit; or 
(2)  The contractor has not received payment from the property owner for the work authorized by the expired permit; or 
(3)  The property that is subject to the expired permit is part of a probate proceeding, and the expiration of the subject permit is a result of such proceeding; or 
(4)  The property that is subject to the expired permit is part of a bankruptcy, foreclosure, or receivership proceeding, and the expiration of the subject permit is a result of such proceeding; or 
(5)  The expired permit is the subject of a stop work [order] issued as a result of actions by a party other than the contractor. 
    If a new building permit is not obtained within 180 days from the date the initial permit became null and void or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, the Building Official shall require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. If a new permit is issued, the Building Official shall require that the work in place and the work required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time of the issuance of the new permit. 
(c)  If the contractor or the "owner-builder" believes that there are extenuating circumstances that justify the issuance of a permit despite the existence of an expired permit, the contractor or "owner-builder" may appeal the denial of a building permit under this section to the City Council. The City Council shall have the sole discretion whether or not to waive the provisions of this section and authorize the Building Official to issue the building permit. 
(Code 1999, § 9.5-115; Ord. No. 2009-28, § 2, 1-12-10; Ord. No. 2016-10 , § 3, 12-13-2016) 
Sec. 6-59. - Revocation of building permit. 
    The Building Official shall revoke any building permit if a materially false statement is contained in the application or plans for which the permit was issued, and shall also revoke the permit if work is undertaken contrary to the conditions of the building permit unless the unauthorized work is promptly corrected or, where appropriate, an agreement to meet the conditions of Section 6-59 are met within ten (10) working days of receipt on notification of violation. 
(Code 1999, § 9.5-116) 
Sec. 6-60. - Environmental restoration standard and agreements. 
    In the event any land clearing occurs on a site which clearing is outside the scope of any permit issued or for which no permit was issued, the Building Official shall issue a stop work order which shall remain in effect until all of the following restoration conditions have been met: 
(1)  Restoration of the site to its previolation grade. 
(2)  Replacement of the trees, shrubs, and groundcovers on the unlawfully cleared site with native species as appropriate to the site unlawfully cleared. The trees shall be of a size and maturity commensurate to the unlawful clearing as determined by the City Biologist. The native species mix shall consist of the approximate percentages of the predominant tree, shrub and groundcover species on the site unlawfully cleared prior to the violation, but if any endangered or threatened tree, shrub or groundcover species were unlawfully cleared, then those species shall be replaced with plants of a size and maturity commensurate to and related to the unlawful clearing as determined by the City Biologist regardless of predominance. 
(3)  All replanted trees, shrubs, and groundcovers shall be located on site to the maximum extent possible. If all of the replacement plants cannot be physically replanted on site, the remainder shall be donated to the City to restore or manage public lands or, at the discretion of the City, to a willing government agency or a public or private conservation group to restore public lands. Alternatively, an amount of money equal to the rest of the replacement cost may be placed in an escrow account to be used by the City to restore or manage public lands or, at the discretion of the City by a willing government agency or a public or private conservation group for off-site replacement of the affected habitat. The City shall adopt administrative procedures for the management of the escrow account. 
(Code 1999, § 9.5-110) 
Sec. 6-61. - Working through a stop work order/red tag. 
    Any person or entity continuing to perform work subsequent to the issuance of a stop work order or red tag shall be fined the maximum amount allowed under State law and City Ordinance or resolution by the code compliance department.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-12, §§ 2, 3, adopted Aug. 26, 2014, repealed Art. III in its entirety and enacted a new Art. III to read as set out herein. Former Art. III, §§ 6-91-6-100, pertained to unsafe building abatement code and derived from Ord. No. 02-07-11, §§ 1-1, 1-3-1-11, adopted July 9, 2002; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 2, adopted Sept. 17, 2010. 

Sec. 6-91. - Unsafe buildings or systems. 
(a)  All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. All such unsafe buildings, structures or service systems are hereby declared illegal and shall be ordered by the Building Official to be abated by the owner, through repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with this Code. The extent of repairs shall be determined by the Building Official.

(1)  The structure or its electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system is unsafe; dangerous; unsanitary; does not provide adequate egress; constitutes a fire or windstorm hazard; is otherwise dangerous to human life; by reason of illegal or improper use, occupancy or maintenance, constitutes a hazard to safety or health; or has been substantially damaged by the elements, fire, explosion, or otherwise. 
(2)  The structure constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment. 
(3)  The structure is not completed in substantial conformity with the plans and specifications upon which the building permit for construction was issued and 120 days or more have lapsed since the expiration, revocation, or cancellation of the building permit. 
(4)  The structure has been determined to be unsafe for entry or a hazard to fire or law enforcement officials by evidence of a report stating so. 
(5)  The structure has been boarded with materials previously approved by the Building Official and the boarding has been breached without repair. 
(6)  The structure has been used to conduct criminal activity on more than two (2) occasions within a six-month period, and such criminal activity was facilitated by the existence of one (1) or more of the conditions enumerated in this section. 
(7)  The structure is occupied and its storm shutters have not been removed from all of the means of escape required by the Florida Fire Prevention Code after a hurricane watch or warning has expired. 
(8)  The structure is a swimming pool or spa that contains stagnant water or does not conform to Section 424.2.17 of the Florida Building Code. 
(9)  There is an accumulation of debris or other combustible material in the structure that creates a hazard of combustion or the condition of the structure creates a hazard with respect to the means of egress and fire protection. 
(c)  A structure shall be presumed to be unsafe if: 
(1)  There is falling-away, hanging, or loose siding, blocks, bricks, or other building material; 
(2)  The structure or its structural parts are deteriorated; 
(3)  The structure is partially destroyed; 
(4)  There is an unusual sagging or leaning out of plumb or square of the structure and such effect is caused by deterioration or over-stressing; 
(5)  The electrical, plumbing, or mechanical installations or systems create a hazardous condition contrary to the standards of the Florida Building Code and the National Electric Code; 
(6)  An unsanitary condition exists by reason of inadequate or malfunctioning sanitary facilities or waste disposal systems; 
(7)  The structure is occupied and there is no potable water service or electrical service; 
(8)  The construction of the structure or the construction or installation of systems or components within the structure has been commenced or completed without a permit or where the permit has expired prior to appropriate inspections and completion and the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion; 
(9)  The structure is vacant and abandoned and is not covered at the doors or windows or is covered with materials not previously approved by the Building Official; 
(10)  By reason of illegal or improper use, the occupancy or maintenance does not comply with the Florida Building Code or the Florida Fire Prevention Code; or 
(11)  The structure or part thereof meets any of the physical criteria of an unsafe structure set forth above and has not been repaired and brought into compliance with the applicable codes following the expiration of a reasonable notice period. 
(d)  When the building official determines a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof is unsafe, as set forth in this Code he/she shall provide the owner, agent or person in control of such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system written notice of violation stating the defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner within a stated time either to complete specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof. At the option of the local government, the processes and procedures for code enforcement under Fla. Stat. ch. 162 may be utilized to abate violation under this section. If this statutory method of enforcement is invoked, the Code Compliance Board established in Chapter 10 of the City of Marathon's Code of Ordinances will initiate enforcement proceedings, and notice shall be in accordance with the provisions of the statute. 
(e)  If necessary, the notice shall also require the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems or portion thereof to be vacated and/or disconnected, and not reoccupied and/or reconnected until the specified repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the building official. The building official shall post at each entrance to the building a placard stating: 
THIS BUILDING IS UNSAFE AND ITS USE OR OCCUPANCY HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING OFFICIAL. 
    This placard shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation or its officers, agents, or other servants, to remove the posting without written permission of the Building Official, or for any person to enter the building, or use the building or system(s) except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing same. 
(1)  All administrative costs and costs of corrective action incurred by the City in enforcing this chapter shall be promptly paid by the owner or interested party or they shall become an assessment and lien on the property where the unsafe structure is located. The City may record an affidavit setting forth its costs and may foreclose on any unpaid liens. The City may sell as salvage or require the demolition contractor to dispose of the contents of the structure demolished. The City's assessment lien for the costs of repair shall have equal dignity with a lien for taxes. 
(f)  In case the owner, agent, or person in control cannot be found within the stated time limit, or, if such owner, agent, or person in control shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with notice to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish, and remove said building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof, the Building Official shall notify the Code Compliance Board and request a hearing. In the case of the violation posing a serious threat, and after having ascertained the cost, the Building Official may take action to cause such building, structure, electrical, gas; mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof, to be demolished, secured, repaired, or required to remain vacant or unused. Taking such action does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the Building Official to continue with maintaining such building, structure, or system; or create liability for any damage to the property. 
(g)  The decision of the Building Official shall be final in cases of emergency, which, in the opinion of the Building Official, involve imminent danger to human life or health, or the property of others. He/she shall promptly cause such building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or portion thereof to be made safe or cause its removal. For this purpose he/she may at once enter such structure or land on which it stands, or abutting land or structures, with such assistance and at such cost as he may deem necessary. He/she may order the vacating of adjacent structures and may require the protection of the public by appropriate fence or such other means as maybe necessary, and for this purpose may close a public or private way. The costs incurred in the performance of this emergency work shall be paid by the City, and upon recording in the public records of Monroe County an affidavit of the Building Official or Fire Official the amount so expended, these costs shall become an assessment and lien against the property as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 3, 8-26-2014) 
Sec. 6-92. - Enforcement proceedings; hearings. 
    The City may enforce this chapter by any other lawful means and these procedures are supplemental to all others and shall not be deemed prerequisites to filing a suit for the enforcement of any section of the Code. One (1) of these means is through code enforcement. A property owner must have exhausted the administrative remedies prior to filing any action in court. 
    Violation proceedings and hearings for unsafe structures and equipment will be conducted before the Code Compliance Board or Special Magistrate in accordance with the provisions set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 162. The owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court is required to make disclosures as outlined in Fla. Stat. ch. 162 before a transfer of property, and failure to make the required disclosures creates a presumption of fraud. 
(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 3, 8-26-2014) 
Sec. 6-93. - Administrative fines; costs to repair; liens. 
    All costs associated with taking a case before the Enforcement Board shall be recovered where the jurisdiction prevails. Whenever one (1) of the orders of the Enforcement Board or the Special Magistrate has not been complied with by the time set for compliance, for each day thereafter during which each violation continues past the date set for compliance, the Enforcement Board or the Special Magistrate may impose a fine, Section 10-6, "Fines and related terms construed." All costs incurred as a result of actions taken per Section 6-91.3 are charged to the violator. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair, and the costs of prosecuting the case may be recorded in the public records and shall thereafter constitute a lien against the land where the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 3, 8-26-2014) 
Sec. 6-94. - Appeal. 
    An order of the Code Compliance Board containing findings of fact and conclusions of law that a violation of the City Code has occurred shall be a final administrative order of the Code Enforcement Board as provided in Fla. Stat. § 162.1. Any appeal taken from this order must be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order as provided in Fla. Stat. § 162.11. An order imposing a fine, entered for failure to comply with an order of the Code Enforcement Board, shall only be considered a final administrative order of the Code Compliance Board for the purposes of an appeal to determine whether the violator complied with the order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law. Failure to file an appeal within the prescribed 30-day period shall render the order of the Code Compliance Board conclusive, binding and final.

The watercraft may be moored at either an existing on-site docking facility or stored on a trailer in an approved parking space. Vehicles, watercraft, and trailers may be parked on the right-of-way within the limits of the vacation rental unit property lines if it is the common practice of those on the street where the vacation rental is located, and the placement of the vehicle, watercraft, or trailers would not impede the normal and safe flow of traffic on the street.

(11)  There shall be a written lease between a vacation rental dwelling owner and the tenant and it shall contain the tenant's agreements to the following:

Sec. 10-2. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City, by authorizing the establishment of Code Compliance procedures to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective and inexpensive method of enforcing any code provision, ordinance, approval, development permit or order, or resolution issued pursuant to any ordinance or provision of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 02-07-09, § 2(6.3-2), 7-9-2002) 
Sec. 10-3. - Applicability. 
    Pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 162.03, the City may establish, by resolution, a code compliance system that shall provide for a Code Compliance Board or Special Master. 
(Ord. No. 02-07-09, § 2(6.3-3), 7-9-2002) 
Sec. 10-4. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter and Fla. Stat. ch. 162, pt. I (Fla. Stat. § 162.01 et seq.) and pt. II (Fla. Stat. § 162.21 et seq.), the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein.

    Code Compliance Officer means any authorized agent or employee of the City whose duty it is to ensure compliance with the Code. 
    Continuing violation means a violation which remains uncorrected beyond the time period for correction contained in either the notice of violation or the Final Order of the Code Compliance Board, whichever is applicable. Each day such violation continues shall be declared to constitute a continuing and separate violation and no additional notice shall be required.

    Notice of violation means a violation notice issued to a violator. A notice of violation may include a citation issued pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 162, pt. II (Fla. Stat. § 162.21 et seq.). 
    Repeat violation means a violation of a provision of this Code by a person who has been previously found by the Code Compliance Board or any other quasi-judicial or judicial process, to have violated or who has admitted violating the same provision within five years prior to the violation, notwithstanding that the violations occur at different locations.

(Ord. No. 02-07-09, § 2(6.3-4), 7-9-2002; Ord. No. 2017-03 , § 2, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 10-5. - Establishment of Special Magistrate System. 
(a)  There is hereby created pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 162.03(2), an alternate code enforcement system. This alternate code enforcement system shall have the same status as a code enforcement board. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the City from enforcing any ordinance or code through a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  There is hereby created a code enforcement system which utilizes Special Magistrates, each of whom is to be appointed by the City Council. Special Magistrates shall have the authority to conduct hearings to determine whether a violation of any code or an ordinance of the City of Marathon within the Special Magistrate jurisdiction has occurred and upon finding that a violation has occurred, impose fines, costs, and liens against the violators. 
(c)  All Special Magistrates shall be attorneys for at least five (5) years prior to appointment, who are in good standing with the Florida Bar. The Special Magistrates must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of municipal law and the general procedures for enforcement of municipal codes, and must demonstrate a temperament suitable for the exercise of the quasi-judicial powers vested in each Special Magistrate. 
(d)  The City Council shall appoint as many Special Magistrates as are deemed necessary. All Special Magistrates shall be appointed for a term of one (1) to four (4) years and may be reappointed by the City Council. Despite the term for which they were appointed, all Special Magistrates serve at the pleasure of City Council and may be removed from office by majority vote. If any Special Magistrate fails to attend two (2) of three (3) successive hearings without good cause, the position shall be considered vacated, and the City Council shall promptly fill the remainder of the unexpired term.

(f)  If any Special Magistrate called on to sit in a particular case shall find that his/her private or personal interests are involved in the matter coming before him/her, the Special Magistrate shall disqualify himself/herself from all participation in the case, and an alternate Special Magistrate shall hear the case. The City Manager is authorized to provide an attorney otherwise qualified to sit as a Special Magistrate for an individual case where all Special Magistrates disqualify themselves. 
(g)  The City Attorney, when requested by the City Manager, may represent the City and present cases before the Special Magistrate. In no case shall the City Attorney act as counsel for the Special Magistrate, thereby eliminating possibilities of a conflict of interest. 
(h)  Should the Special Magistrate be unable to issue a decision immediately following any hearing because of questions of law or other matters of such nature that a decision cannot immediately be made, the Special Magistrate may withhold issuing his or her decision for a period not exceeding 30 days. 
(Ord. No. 2017-03 , § 3, 7-11-2017) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-03 , § 3, adopted July 11, 2017, renumbered the former § 10-5 as § 10-10, and added a new § 10-5 as set out herein. The history remains with the renumbered provision. 
Sec. 10-6. - Fines and related terms construed. 
(a)  For each day of a continued violation, an additional fine in the same amount as that prescribed for in the first day of violation shall be added without the need for additional notice. 
(b)  If the violator is found to have violated the Code, the violator shall be held liable for the reasonable costs of prosecution as set forth by resolution of the City Council (the "administration fee") upon such finding. Should the violator fail to correct the violation within the time period granted by the Special Magistrate an additional administration fee shall be imposed at the hearing for noncompliance. 
(c)  For the first repeat violation, the amount of the fine shall be at least double the amount of fine prescribed for the original violation, but shall not exceed $500.00. The amount of the fine due for each subsequent repeat violation shall be $500.00. A repeat violation, which remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction in the notice shall be treated as a continuing violation. 
(d)  Fines for a continuing violation shall accrue from the date of correction given in the notice until the violation is corrected. Upon notification by the Code Compliance Officer that correction of the violation was not made within the period ordered, or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, the Special Magistrate may enter an Order imposing a fine for each day a continuing or repeat violation continues. 
(e)  If the Special Magistrate finds that a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the Special Magistrate shall notify the City Manager, who may order all repairs in order to bring the property into compliance. The City may assess the violator with the cost of the repairs. 
(f)  Fines assessed pursuant to this chapter are due and payable to the City on the last day of the period allowed for the filing of an appeal from the Special Magistrate's decision, or, if a proper appeal is made, when the appeal has been finally decided adversely to the named violator. Fines shall continue to accrue during the pendency of an unsuccessful appeal. 
(g)  The City may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of fines or costs of repairs authorized herein. 
(h)  A fine imposed pursuant to this chapter shall continue until a compliance inspection is requested by the violator and the Code Compliance Officer finds that all violations were corrected. 
(i)  A certified copy of a notice of assessment of cost of repairs may be recorded in the public records and thereafter constitutes a lien on the property on which the repairs were performed. Upon petition to the Circuit court, such notice of assessment may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the Sheriffs of this State, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the date of filing of any such notice of assessment, which remains unpaid, the City may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. Alternatively, the City may sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. Such liens shall be superior and paramount to the interest in such parcel or property of any owner, lessee, tenant, mortgagee or other person except the lien of State, County and City taxes, and providing for the exemption of a super priority bank foreclosure, and shall be on parity with the lien of such State, County and City taxes. 
(j)  Upon payment of the fine or notice of assessment by the violator or the successor, assign or heir of the violator, the City Clerk is authorized to execute and record in the public records of Monroe County the appropriate release of lien document. 
(k)  No lien provided under this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine or notice of assessment has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on a lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party may recover interest and all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, incurred in the action. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(l)  A certified copy of an order imposing an assessment of cost of repairs recorded in the public records shall constitute notice of the violation and any fine or costs imposed therein to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property. The findings therein shall be binding upon the violator, and if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, mortgagees, judgment creditors, successors in interest or assigns. 
(m)  If an order is recorded in the public records and it is complied with by the date specified, the Special Magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance which shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing shall not be required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(n)  The City may charge the violator for all costs incurred in recording and satisfaction of an order imposing fines, and a notice of lien or assessment. 
(o)  The Special Magistrate shall have the power to order the reduction of fines as provided herein. 
(1)  A lien arising from a fine or notice of assessment runs in favor of the City. Upon payment in full of all outstanding fines and administrative fees, the City Manager, or designee, may record a satisfaction of lien. The City shall charge the violator, or other party requesting a satisfaction of the lien, for all costs incurred in recording the satisfaction. 
(2)  The violator, or the violator's successors or assigns, may file a request for a reduction of the fine before the Special Magistrate only after a compliance inspection is completed during which a Code Compliance Officer finds that all violations were corrected. Upon receipt of a written request for reduction of fine, and the filing of an affidavit of partial compliance by the Code Compliance Officer which sets forth that all outstanding violations of the Order of the Special Magistrate have been corrected, except for payment of any outstanding fines, the Manager or designee, shall set the matter for hearing as provided for in Fla. Stat. § 162.07. If the City has initiated further enforcement action to obtain compliance with the Order of the Special Magistrate, including but not limited to an action for injunctive relief, foreclosure, or money judgment, the violator may not file a request for reduction of fine and no hearing shall be set. If the violator has already filed a request for reduction of fine, and a hearing has already been set, the hearing will not take place. 
(3)  At the hearing, the fact-finding determination of the Special Magistrate shall be limited to evidence establishing: 
a.  Good cause for a reduction of fine; 
b.  The amount of the reduction; and 
c.  Any equitable considerations raised by the violator or relating to good cause or the amount of the reduction. 
Said hearing shall not be an opportunity to appeal any finding of fact or conclusions of law set forth in any prior Order of the Special Magistrate or any administrative determination of the City. 
(4)  The Special Magistrate may reduce a fine once a violator has otherwise complied with an Order of the Special Magistrate based on a showing of good cause, but, except as provided in Subsection 10-6(o)(12), the fine shall not be reduced below the costs incurred by the City in its prosecution of violations, including but not limited to, any attorney fees and staff time. In no event shall any administrative fees previously ordered by the Special Magistrate be waived or reduced. 
(5)  In determining good cause, and the amount of the reduction, if any, the Special Magistrate shall consider: 
a.  The gravity of the violation. 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation. 
c.  Any previous or other outstanding violations committed by the violator or pertaining to the property to which the lien attaches, unless an order finding a violation is under appeal at the time of the determination. 
d.  Whether the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature. 
e.  Whether the violator's failure to timely comply with an Order of the Special Magistrate is due to an inability to comply based on factors beyond the control of the violator. 
(6)  Upon a finding of good cause, the Special Magistrate has the sole discretion to grant or deny the request for a reduction of fine according to the following guidelines, provided the reduction is not less than the costs incurred by the City: 
a.  If compliance occurs within three (3) months of the date for compliance set forth in the Order of the Special Magistrate, a maximum reduction of 95 percent of the total fine (the original fine plus the continuing fine amounts); 
b.  If compliance occurs more than three (3) months but less than 18 months from the compliance date, a maximum reduction of 75 percent of the total fine amount; 
c.  If compliance occurs from 18 months to 36 months of the compliance date, a maximum reduction of 50 percent of the total fine amount; and 
d.  If compliance occurs 36 months or more after the compliance date, a maximum reduction of 25 percent of the total fine amount. 
(7)  The Special Magistrate has the authority where there is a demonstrated showing of financial hardship, or other good cause, to reduce fines below the fine reduction guidelines. A violator alleging financial hardship or other good cause, has the burden of presenting evidence of inability to pay the fines or that good cause exists. 
(8)  If a fine is reduced, the Order of the Special Magistrate shall provide that, if the violator fails to pay the reduced fine by the date ordered, then the original amount of the fine shall be automatically reinstated. 
(9)  A certified copy of the order reducing the fine shall not be recorded in the public records and the order shall so provide. 
(10)  Upon receipt of timely payment in full of the amount of the reduced fine and the recording costs, the City Manager, or designee, shall record a copy of the order reducing the fine and a satisfaction of lien. 
(11)  A reduction of fine may only be granted once as to any violation of an Order of the Special Magistrate. 
(12)  An order on a request for reduction of fine shall be considered a recommendation to the City Council. The violator, or successors or assigns, may file with the City Manager a written request for reconsideration by the City Council within 30 days of the date the Order of the Special Magistrate is entered. Such request must be accompanied by a non-refundable $500.00 application fee to cover the costs of staff time necessary to administer and process the request. If such a request is timely filed the City Manager shall place the order on the agenda for the next available Council meeting. If no such request is timely filed, the order shall become final. Any deadline in the Order of the Special Magistrate for payment of the reduced fine shall not be tolled by the filing of a request for reconsideration, however the City Council may extend the deadline. Any order of the City Council on a request for reconsideration may be governed by the provisions of this section relating to reductions of fines. The City Council may, for good cause shown, reduce the fine below the fine reduction guidelines. The City Council may also, for good cause shown, reduce the application fee or allow it to be used as a set off against the original or reduced fine. The City Manager, or designee, shall remand the matter to the Special Magistrate for entry of an order consistent with the determination of the City Council and providing a deadline for payment of the reduced fine. A hearing shall not be required to issue such order. 
(13)  Upon written request of a violator, the Special Magistrate may, for good cause shown, including but not limited to good faith efforts by the violator to bring the violation into compliance, suspend the accrual of additional fines subsequent to the entry of an order of violation or order imposing fine. 
(p)  Notwithstanding the above subsections, at the discretion of the Manager, a Stipulation may be entered into to avoid the necessity of a hearing/trial. A Stipulation shall include an admission of guilt or responsibility upon the part of the Respondent, time to correct, and a penalty and/or an agreed upon penalty in the case of non-compliance.

Sec. 10-10. - Amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 162. 
    The provisions of Fla. Stat. § 162.07, as adopted by this chapter, are hereby amended to read as follows: 
(1)  A hearing date shall not be postponed or continued unless a request for continuance, showing good cause for such continuance, is received in writing by the Special Magistrate at least six (6) days prior to the hearing. When considering a request for a continuance, the Special Magistrate may consider whether the party requesting the continuance is working towards compliance with the Code, the timeliness of the request for continuance, whether the party requesting the continuance acted diligently in doing so, the unavailability of a necessary witness or other evidence without inexcusable neglect on the part of the party wishing to call said witness or present said evidence, and any other exigent circumstances including a medical emergency, an act of God or other unforeseen event. Inexcusable neglect on the part of the party requesting it shall not constitute good cause for a continuance. If a request for continuance is received less than six (6) days prior to the hearing, the continuance may only be granted upon a finding of a medical emergency, an act of God or other unforeseen event. If a continuance is granted, the City Manager or designee shall notify the Code Compliance Officer and the violator of the date and time of the rescheduled hearing. 
(2)  The Special Magistrate shall not postpone a hearing because the named violator, prior to the scheduled hearing date, files with the duly authorized City board of appropriate jurisdiction, if any, an administrative appeal concerning the interpretation or application of the Code provisions upon which the alleged violation was based. Rather the hearing shall take place as provided in this chapter and an order shall be issued subject to a determination in favor of the violator by said duly authorized Board. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the fine assessed by the Special Magistrate will be retroactively imposed. However, once an issue has been determined by the Special Magistrate in a specific case, that issue may not be further reviewed by a City board in that specific case unless an appeal was filed with such board prior to the Code Compliance hearing.

    The Sheriff's office shall send, by certified mail return receipt requested, to the burglar or robbery alarm user, an invoice for each false burglar or robbery alarm for which a service charge is due. The alarm user shall be responsible for paying the service charge to the Sheriff's office within 30 days of his receipt of the invoice. The employment by the alarm user of an alarm installation, monitoring or maintenance firm or a security firm shall not relieve the alarm user of the responsibility for the payment of false alarm service charges. All past due service charges may be collected in the name of Monroe County by either counsel to the Sheriff's office or the County Attorney's office through any available lawful means. All false burglar or robbery alarm service charges collected shall be turned over to the Clerk of the Circuit court for deposit in the fine and forfeiture fund.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 15-1. - Fire safety codes adopted. 
    The provisions of the Florida Fire Prevention Code are adopted by reference.

State Law reference- Florida Fire Prevention Code, Fla. Stat. § 633.0215; minimum fire safety standards, Fla. Stat. § 633.025. 
Sec. 15-2. - Fire alarms. 
(a)  Purpose of regulation. The purpose of this section is to place responsibility on alarm users to prevent, by use of appropriate mechanical, electrical, or other means, false fire alarms. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm user means the person or other entity that owns, possesses, controls, occupies, or manages any premises as defined in this section. 
    False fire alarm means a signal from a fire alarm system that elicits a response by the fire department when no actual or threatened fire-related emergency exists. This definition includes signals activated by negligence, accident, mechanical failure, and electrical failure; signals activated intentionally in nonemergency situations; and signals for which the actual cause of activation is unknown. It is a rebuttable presumption that a fire alarm is false if personnel responding from the fire department do not discover any evidence of fire or other emergency after following normal fire department operating procedures in investigating the incident. An alarm is not false if the alarm user proves that: 
(1)  An individual activated the alarm based upon a reasonable belief that a fire-related emergency existed; 
(2)  The alarm system was activated by lightning or an electrical surge that caused physical damage to the system, as evidenced by the testimony of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an on-site inspection and personally observed the damage to the system; or 
(3)  The alarm was activated by vandals. 
    Fire alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal the occurrence of fire-related emergency requiring urgent attention and to which fire department personnel may reasonably be expected to respond, but does not include such alarms installed in residential buildings of four (4) units or less. 
    Premises means the building or structure or portion of a building or structure upon which is installed or maintained a fire alarm system. 
(c)  Fire alarms: posting requirements. A fire alarm user shall conspicuously post at the main entrance to the alarm user's premises a notice stating: 
(1)  The name of an individual or alarm company able and authorized to enter the premises and deactivate the alarm. 
(2)  Emergency telephone numbers by which those individuals can be reached at all times. 
(3)  The name and address of the alarm user. The information must be kept current, and failure to update this information within 48 hours of any change constitutes a violation of this section. 
(4)  A standard fire alarm tag, complying with division of state Fire Marshal uniform fire safety rules and standards. 
(d)  False fire alarms prohibited. No fire alarm user shall cause, allow, or permit its fire alarm system to give three (3) or more false fire alarms in any calendar year. 
(e)  Inspection requirements. After the second and each additional false fire alarm in one (1) calendar year, the alarm user must within 30 days file a written certificate with the Fire Marshal's office from a licensed fire alarm system contractor stating that the fire alarm system has been inspected since the last false fire alarm and is functioning properly. 
(f)  Penalties. Each violation of this section shall be punished as follows: 
(1)  For a first violation of Subsection (c) of this section, a written warning to be issued. 
(2)  For a second and each additional violation of Subsection (c) of this section, by a fine of $250.00. 
(3)  For the third false fire alarm in one (1) calendar year, by a fine of $250.00. 
(4)  For the fourth and each additional false fire alarm in one (1) calendar year, by a fine of $250.00. 
(5)  For a first violation of Subsection (e) of this section, a written warning to be issued. 
(6)  For a second and each additional violation of Subsection (e) of this section, by a fine of $250.00. 
(g)  Enforcement. The provisions of this section shall be enforced by the Fire Chief or designee office.

Stat. § 316.003. When making this determination, the Fire Chief or authorized designee shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The number of people who frequent the property; 
(2)  The accessibility of the property by authorized emergency vehicles; and 
(3)  The frequency of calls for emergency services at the property. 
(b)  The Fire Chief or authorized designee, upon determining that there are areas within a shopping center, shopping mall, parking lot or parking garage, which should be kept free of parked vehicles in order to facilitate building access by authorized emergency vehicles, shall discuss the matter with the owner or lessee of the property, and if there is no objection, shall permit the owner or lessee of the property to erect emergency vehicles zone signs in accordance with Subsection (d) of this section.

An application for a fireworks display must be received by the Fire Chief or designee at least 30 days in advance of the date of display under written procedures and on a form approved by the city commission. Any indemnification and hold-harmless agreement on behalf of the City Council should be approved by the City Council. 
(2)  The Fire Chief or designee shall determine that the applicant has purchased a liability insurance policy of not less than $500,000.00 per person or $1,000,000.00 per incident for all claims, that the City is named as a coinsured, that the City will be held harmless from any liabilities relative to the display of fireworks under the permit, and that the City will be afforded a defense to any action. 
(3)  Further, the Fire Chief or designee shall require that the fireworks display will be supervised by a person trained in pyrotechnics.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 18-1. - Price gouging. 
(a)  Compliance with County or Municipal regulations. Unless otherwise provided, nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a person from compliance with applicable County or Municipal regulations. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set measures in place necessary to the protection of life and property, threatened because of natural, technological, or other disasters and emergencies. This section is not intended to preempt or to restrict the application of other more restrictive ordinances already in effect. Neither is this section intended to preempt or to preclude the application or enforcement of local emergency management measures already in effect, or which will be effective upon a declaration of emergency. This section is not intended and may not be construed as imposing price controls upon lawful business activities, but rather prohibits the unfair and deceptive trade practice of price gouging during a locally declared emergency. 
(c)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Average retail price means the average price at which similar merchandise was being sold during the 30 days immediately preceding the declaration of a local emergency. 
    Consumer goods means any article, product, merchandise, or commodity of any kind or class which is customarily produced or distributed for sale at retail for consumption by individuals or use by individuals, including but not limited to, food, water, ice, clothing, lumber, hardware, chain saws, generators, home improvement materials, and fuel products.

    Local Emergency means any one declared in Monroe County pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 252.38. 
    Unconscionable means and is to be used in the sense that it is prima facie evidence that a price is unconscionable if: 
(1)  The amount charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the commodity that is the subject of the offer or transaction and the average price at which that commodity was offered for rent or sale in the usual course of business during the 30 days immediately prior to a declaration of a local state of emergency, and the increase in the amount charged is not attributable to additional costs incurred in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity or national or international market trends; however, a mere price increase approved or authorized by a government agency, law, statute, or regulation is not unconscionable and is not a violation of this section's prohibitions; or 
(2)  The amount charged grossly exceeds the average price at which the same or similar commodity was readily obtainable in the trade area during the 30 days immediately prior to a local declaration of a state of emergency, and the increase in the amount charged is not attributable to additional costs incurred in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity or national or international market trends; however, a mere price increase approved or authorized by a government agency, law, statute, or regulation is not unconscionable and is not a violation of this section's prohibitions. 
(d)  Prohibitions against price gouging. 
(1)  Upon declaration of local emergency, and throughout the duration of such emergency, it is an unlawful method of competition and an unfair and deceptive trade act or practice for a person or his or her agency or employee doing business in the City to charge an unconscionable price for any consumer goods. 
(2)  This subsection does not prevent the seller of consumer goods from charging an amount in excess of the average retail price, if such higher price is in the direct result of, and limited to, any increased cost for the consumer goods from the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler to the seller. In such instances, only the actual cost increase per item from the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler may be added to the average retail price. 
(3)  This subsection does not interfere with the authority of government to acquire and to distribute consumer goods, supplies, materials, and facilities, with or without compensation. 
(4)  A price increase approved or authorized by a government agency, law, statute, or regulation is not a violation of this section's prohibitions.

Subdivision II. - Permits 

Sec. 18-99. - Required. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to acquire, possess, purchase, handle, dispose of, store or use an explosive on any site without first obtaining a permit issued under and pursuant to the provisions of this division. The requirements of this division shall not relieve any person from compliance with the provisions of Fla. Stat. Ch. 552 and all rules and regulations promulgated by the State Fire Marshal. 
(b)  A user shall obtain a user permit to purchase explosives, to store explosives and have blasting done at an approved site. 
(c)  A blaster shall obtain a blaster permit to use explosives and blasting agents at an approved site. 
(d)  A blasting design shall be submitted by the blaster whenever blasting is proposed within a scaled distance of 150 from public buildings, dwellings, schools, community or institutional buildings. The blast design shall be reviewed and approved by the Building Official when application is made for a permit. The applicant shall provide written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all residents or owners of buildings or structures in a form acceptable to the Building Official within a scaled distance of 150 from the proposed blast site at least 60 days prior to the blasting date, accompanied by a copy of the blasting schedule stating dates and approximate times of proposed blasting. The 60 days' notice allows sufficient time for recipients of such notice to be informed that a preblasting inspection of their building will be conducted by the blasting permit applicant unless refused, time for the applicant's inspectors access to the affected building to be scheduled with the owner/occupant present when necessary, and time for the permittee to provide the results of such inspection to the Building Official and structure owners. All structures within a scaled distance of 150 from the blast site shall be inspected unless the resident, owner or occupant refuses the inspection. Preblasting inspections within the scaled distance of 150 shall be prepared and certified at the applicant's expense by a seismologist or other person prequalified by the Building Official to perform such inspections. Preblasting inspections beyond the scaled distance of 150 limit are an option of the owner of existing buildings or structures, and expense for same shall be borne by such owner. Scaled distance shall be determined using the following formula: 
Scaled Distance = d/w1/2 
Where d = the distance in feet to the closest structure not owned by the applicant. 
Where w = the charge weight of explosives per delay (the maximum pounds per delay). 
Examples utilizing this required formula on a per-charge basis with 8 milliseconds required minimum delay between charges: 
Charge weight in pounds Minimum required 
preblast inspection 
radius in feet 1 150 5 335 25 750 50 1,061 75 1,299 100 1,500  
Structures expected to receive a particle velocity in excess of twenty one-hundredths (0.20) inch per second shall be inspected, unless refused. A written listing of structures to be inspected shall be sent to the Building Official for review and approval prior to implementation of the inspection program. A copy of the preblast inspection report in its entirety shall be forwarded to the Building Official. The results of the preblasting inspection program shall be reviewed by the Building Official and the seismologist of record prior to implementation of the blasting activity. During the course of blasting operations, seismic and, where required, atmospheric overpressure or airblast records shall be mailed to the Building Official on a monthly basis unless circumstances warrant more frequent reporting. 
(e)  A blaster shall utilize for monitoring purposes a seismograph and/or a standard sound level meter, where required by the Building Official, of a type or types acceptable to the Building Official, which is/are adequate to accurately record the inches per second of particle velocity and/or, where required, the decibel level (dB or dBC) of atmospheric overpressure or airblast resulting from blasting operations. 
(f)  Permits required by Subsection (a) of this section shall not be issued for: 
(1)  Liquid nitroglycerin. 
(2)  Nitrocellulose in a dry and uncompressed condition in a quantity greater than ten (10) pounds net weight in one (1) package. 
(3)  Fulminate of mercury in a dry condition and fulminate of all other metals in any condition except as a component of manufactured articles not hereinafter forbidden. 
(4)  Explosive compositions that ignite spontaneously or undergo marked decomposition, rendering the products or their use more hazardous, when subjected for 48 consecutive hours or less to a temperature of 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius). 
(5)  New explosives until approved by the United States Department of Transportation, except that permits may be issued to educational, governmental or industrial laboratories for instructional or research purposes.

Sec. 18-149. - Application. 
(a)  An application for a permit to hold a public assembly must be filed with the City Manager or designee at least nine (9) days before the day on which the public assembly is to be held. There shall be a fee associated with the application, which shall be established by resolution of the City Council. The City Manager is authorized to waive said fee in the instance that the applicant represents a legally accepted not-for-profit organization. However, if the public assembly is to be held within nine (9) days after a specific and unanticipated event or announcement of public importance and in response to it, the application may be filed within 24 hours after the event or announcement and at least 36 hours before the public assembly is to be held. The City Manager or designee may also receive and act on an application even though the application was not filed in time if necessary to preserve the First Amendment rights of an applicant. 
(b)  The application for a permit to hold a public assembly must be in writing and signed by an individual authorized to act for the person sponsoring the public assembly. The application must state: 
(1)  The date and hours the public assembly is to be held;

(3)  The designated place where the assembly is to be held; 
(4)  The date on which the public assembly is to be held and the anticipated daily hours of operation; 
(5)  That the requested use by the applicant of the designated place has been granted by the person or government having the authority to grant the use of that place (in the case of City-owned property, the grant of the permit is permission to use the place); 
(6)  The estimated number of persons expected to participate in or attend the public assembly; 
(7)  The general nature of the public assembly and the arrangements made to protect the public health and safety during the conduct of the public assembly, including arrangements with respect to traffic direction and control, crowd control and sanitation facilities; 
(8)  Any additional information the applicant wishes to furnish. 
(c)  Upon the receipt of an application for a permit to hold a public assembly, the City Manager or designee must note the time of filing on the application. 
(d)  At the request of the City Manager or designee, the individual authorized to represent the applicant, the County Sheriff or his designee, the Fire Marshal and a representative of the County Health Department must meet with the City Manager or designee to negotiate mutually satisfactory conditions under which the public assembly may be held in order to avoid substantial harm to the public health or safety, to minimize or avoid substantial harm to or impairment of the normal use of a public place, or to avoid substantial harm to the environment. 
(e)  The City Manager or designee must either: 
(1)  Issue the public assembly permit on the terms requested; 
(2)  Issue the permit subject to conditions; or 
(3)  Deny the permit. 
The City Manager or designee must give the applicant immediate notice in writing of his action on the application. The City Manager or designee is deemed to have granted the permit on the terms requested if, in the case of a permit applied for at least nine (9) days before the date of the public assembly, the City Manager or designee fails to issue a permit or a written denial four (4) days before the scheduled date of the public assembly, or if, in the case of a permit applied for eight (8) days or less before the date of the public assembly, the City Manager or designee fails to issue a permit or a denial 24 hours before the scheduled date of the public assembly.

Sec. 18-150. - Basis for grant of a permit. 
    If there is not a reasonable likelihood that the public assembly will substantially harm the public health or safety or the environment or substantially impair the normal use of a public place, then the City Manager or designee must grant the permit on the terms requested. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-19) 
Sec. 18-151. - Criteria for imposing conditions on the permit. 
    If there is a reasonable likelihood that a public assembly will substantially harm the public health or safety or environment or substantially harm, or impair the normal use of, a public place, then the City Manager or designee may grant the permit only upon conditions reasonably necessary to avoid substantial harm to the public health or safety or environment and to minimize the effect of, or avoid, the substantial impairment of the normal use of a public place. These conditions may include designating a different time and place; restricting the daily hours and duration of the public assembly; requiring the installation of temporary sanitation facilities; requiring the provision of emergency medical or fire services; requiring the applicant to establish crowd and traffic control procedures; requiring the presence of law enforcement officers; requiring restoration of the public assembly location to its preassembly condition; and requiring the applicant to designate individuals in charge to facilitate dealing with any emergencies that may arise. If there is an admission charge or if goods or services are sold or donations solicited in exchange for goods or services, then the City Manager or designee may require the person holding the public assembly to reimburse the City for the cost of any additional law enforcement officers, emergency medical personnel, and firefighters; to restore the public assembly location to its preassembly condition, and to furnish a bond, in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, to ensure reimbursement and restoration. In determining whether to grant a permit only upon compliance with conditions, the City Manager or designee must consider whether: 
(1)  A permit has been granted to others to hold a public assembly at the same time in the same or nearby location; 
(2)  Public sanitation facilities are adequate; 
(3)  Noise, litter, the pollution of water or air, or damage to the environment, will be caused by the public assembly; 
(4)  Traffic generated by the public assembly will affect normal traffic movement; 
(5)  The time and place are suitable in view of the number of persons expected to attend; 
(6)  Food, water, and emergency medical and fire services are accessible to the public assembly; 
(7)  Temporary structures such as tents or stages are anticipated; 
(8)  There is sufficient time to permit law enforcement, fire and emergency medical officers to make the necessary arrangements to avoid substantial harm to the public health and safety; 
(9)  The public assembly will substantially impair the provision of fire and police protection and medical and other essential services; 
(10)  The public assembly will unreasonably interfere with the quiet enjoyment of a residential community; 
(11)  There is an alternate available location that will reasonably serve the objectives of the public assembly if the requested location will likely result in substantial harm to the public health or safety or environment or will cause substantial harm to, or impairment of the normal use of a public place; 
(12)  There is a special relationship between the subject of the public assembly and the location that makes it reasonable to impose extraordinary burdens on the individuals residing or present in nearby areas; and 
(13)  The imposition of conditions will materially interfere with the reasonable and lawful objectives of the public assembly. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-20) 
Sec. 18-152. - Denial of a permit. 
    If there is a reasonable likelihood that a public assembly will substantially harm the public health or safety or the environment and the harm cannot be sufficiently mitigated or avoided by the imposition of conditions, then the City Manager or designee must deny the permit application and immediately inform the applicant in writing stating the reasons for denial. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-21) 
Sec. 18-153. - Noise permit; alcoholic beverage permit. 
    If the public assembly will require a noise permit or variance under Chap. 13, Art. 3, Monroe County Code, Noise Control, then the applicant must obtain a noise permit or variance under the procedures set forth in that article. A public assembly permit does not authorize, waive, or exempt a violation of Chap. 13, Art. 3, Monroe County Code. A public assembly permit also does not constitute an authorization or permit for the sale of alcoholic beverages. If the applicant wishes to sell alcoholic beverages at the public assembly, he must obtain a permit for such sales through the applicable provisions of the Monroe County Code. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-22) 
Sec. 18-154. - Modification of permit terms; revocation of a permit. 
(a)  If there is a material change in the circumstances of the public assembly after a permit is granted, the applicant must immediately inform the City Manager or designee of the change. 
(b)  By agreement with the applicant, the City Manager or designee may at any time amend the terms of the permit to impose additional or different conditions. On the basis of material change in the circumstances, as either reported by the applicant or determined by the City Manager or designee after investigation, that present a reasonable likelihood that the public assembly will substantially harm the public health or safety or the environment, or will substantially impair the normal use of a public place not covered by the permit, the City Manager or designee may impose additional or different conditions to the extent authorized by Section 18-151. If the applicant and the City Manager or designee cannot agree on the additional or modified conditions, the City Manager or designee may unilaterally amend the permit but such amendment is not effective until a written notice of the permit amendment is furnished to the applicant. 
(c)  If the change in circumstances, as reported to or determined by the City Manager or designee, is such that there is a reasonable likelihood that the public assembly will substantially harm the public health or safety or the environment and that the harm cannot be avoided by the imposition of additional or different conditions as authorized by Section 18-151, then the City Manager or designee must revoke the permit and immediately inform the applicant in writing of the revocation and the reasons for it. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-23) 
Sec. 18-155. - City Manager or designee's decision is final administrative action. 
    All decisions made by the City Manager or designee regarding the issuance, issuance with conditions, denial, modification, or revocation of a public assembly permit, constitute the final administrative action of the City. Prompt judicial review is as provided by State law. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-24) 
Sec. 18-156. - Conduct under a permit not a violation of other ordinances. 
    Except as provided in Section 18-153, all actions and conduct at a public assembly permitted by the terms of a permit are deemed not to violate any City ordinance or regulation, including the City land development regulations and comprehensive plan. 
(Code 1999, § 10.5-25) 
Sec. 18-157. - Violations. 
    Persons who knowingly cause, authorize, or permit a public assembly without a permit or knowingly cause, authorize or permit a public assembly to take place not in conformity with an issued permit, are in violation of this Division.

Sec. 22-19. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bulky wastes means items whose large size or weight precludes or complicates their handling by normal collection processing or disposal methods. 
    Cigar means a tightly rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco leaf, rolled in a series of types and sizes, that is ignited so that its smoke may be drawn into the mouth. 
    Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities in Brazil, Cameroon, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canary Islands (Spain), Italy and the eastern United States. The origins of cigar smoking are still unknown. In Guatemala, a ceramic pot dating back to the tenth century features a Mayan smoking tobacco leaves tied together with a string. Sikar , the term for smoking used by the Maya, may have inspired the name cigar. 
    Cigarette means a small cylinder of finely cut tobacco leaves rolled in thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one (1) end and allowed to smolder; its smoke is inhaled from the other end, which is held in or to the mouth; in some cases, a cigarette holder may be used, as well. Most modern manufactured cigarettes are filtered and also include reconstituted tobacco and other additives. 
    The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but can apply to similar devices containing other substances, such as cloves or cannabis. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is normally white, though other colors and flavors are also available. Cigars are typically composed entirely of whole-leaf tobacco. 
    Collector means a person authorized by the Board of County Commissioners to collect and transport solid waste within the City. 
    Commercial means and includes all nonresidential and industrial establishments, but not limited to and without regard to whether they are profit or nonprofit organizations or retail and/or wholesale establishments, motels, hotels, stores, schools, churches, hospitals, office buildings, restaurants, service stations, garages, laundries, cleaning establishments, public or private institutions of all types, and all other business required to pay business license taxes.

(a)  In the event of the release of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant, the City Manager is authorized to act by undertaking temporary emergency response measures to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with the release. The measures may include, but are not limited to, security fencing, source control, release containment, neutralization or other treatment methods, contaminated runoff control, and similar activities which mitigate the immediate threats to human health and the environment. All temporary emergency measures undertaken by the City Manager shall, when possible, be consistent with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, 42 USC § 9601 et seq.), the National Contingency Plan (42 USC § 9605), and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (42 USC § 11001 et seq.). 
(b)  The city manager shall, within 24 hours of undertaking the temporary emergency response measures, contact the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to provide the Federal government with an opportunity to determine if a Federal response is necessary. 
(c)  No later than the date of the completion of the temporary emergency response measures to the release of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants, the city manager shall seek reimbursement of the cost to the City of those measures from all potentially responsible parties and their insurance companies to the full extent allowed by Federal and State law. In addition, the city manager shall actively seek out any grants or reimbursement which may be available from the State to cover the costs of the City's temporary emergency response. 
(Code 1999, § 8-112) 
Sec. 22-52. - Same-Authority to seek reimbursement for costs incurred from hazardous release. 
(a)  If after 60 days from the date of completion of the City's temporary emergency response to the release of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants, it reasonably appears to the City Manager that any potentially responsible parties or their insurance companies are unwilling or unable to pay the cost of the City's response and that reimbursement or a grant from the State is unlikely, the City Manager is authorized to file an application with the EPA pursuant to 42 USC § 9623 and 40 CFR 310 for reimbursement of those costs allowed under the statute and rule. The application shall be filed not later than one (1) year after the date of the completion of the City's emergency response. 
(b)  If subsequent to the City's receipt of reimbursement from the EPA, the City obtains a recovery for the temporary emergency response costs from a potentially responsible party, an insurance company, the State, or other source, the City Manager is authorized to direct the Clerk to refund the amount of the EPA reimbursement to that agency. 
(c)  If the City receives EPA reimbursement for the temporary emergency response, the City Manager and Clerk are directed to retain all City records pertaining to that reimbursement for a period of ten (10) years from the date of the receipt of the reimbursement. Upon the expiration of the ten (10) years, the records shall not be disposed of until the EPA is contacted pursuant to 40 CFR 310.70. 
(d)  40 CFR 310.50 only allows for one application for reimbursement regardless of the number of local governments which incurred costs in the temporary emergency response release of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants. Therefore, if the City and another local government (e.g. the City of Key West) join in a temporary emergency response, the City Manager is authorized to represent the City in any negotiation with the other local government(s) with regard to which entity shall file the EPA application and the equitable division of any reimbursement received from the EPA. The City Commission shall, however, approve any agreement reached by the City Manager before such shall become binding on the City.

The failure of the owner to receive such supplemental notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a service assessment imposed by the City Council pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the Tax Collector, or the Property Appraiser if so directed by the Tax Collector, or if an alternative method is used to collect the service assessments, such other official as the City Council by resolution shall designate.

Sec. 24-33. - Lien of service assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all service assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, County, District, or Municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a service assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Council of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a service assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property as provided by law. The lien for a service assessment collected under the alternative method of collection provided in Section 24-64 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Council of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. 
(Ord. No. 02-07-13, § 2.09, 7-30-2002) 
Sec. 24-34. - Revisions to service assessment. 
    If any service assessment made under the provisions of this chapter is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the City Council is satisfied that any such service assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the City Council has omitted to include any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the City Council may take all necessary steps to impose a new service assessment against any property benefited by the service costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this chapter and in case such second service assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the City Council may obtain and impose other service assessments until a valid service assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 02-07-13, § 2.10, 7-30-2002) 
Sec. 24-35. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any service assessment under the provisions of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any service assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such service assessment was duly levied, that the service assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such service assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this chapter; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it is clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to a service assessment imposed pursuant to this chapter must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. 02-07-13, § 2.11, 7-30-2002) 
Sec. 24-36. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the Property Appraiser, Tax Collector, City Manager or designee, City Council, their deputies, employees, or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a service assessment imposed by the City Council under the provision of this chapter. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any service assessment should have been imposed under this chapter against a lot or parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of a service, facility, or program, but such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the City Council may, upon provision of appropriate notice as set forth in this article, impose the applicable service assessment for the fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable service assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such total service assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the expiration of 90 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The service assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, County, District, or Municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in Article III hereof. 
(c)  The City Manager or designee shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed appeal petition from the owner of any property subject to a service assessment, to correct any error in applying the service assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Although the appeals process for the original assessments was terminated in November of 2012, properties with a change of use are still able to process an appeal. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the service assessment imposed under the provisions of this chapter. All appeals from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the City Manager or designee and not the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector. No appeal, however, shall be submitted or considered by the City after 360 days of the City's official notice of new or modified assessment. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the Tax Collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the Tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the City Manager or designee.

Sec. 24-37. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim service assessment may be imposed against all property for which a building permit is issued after adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim service assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim service assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim service assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's service assessment. No building permit shall be issued until full payment of the interim service assessment is received by the City. Issuance of the building permit without the payment in full of the interim service assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim service assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the building permit may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in Section 24-63 or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim service assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the building permit was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all State, County, District or Municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the building permit. 
(b)  In the event a building permit expires prior to completion of the building for which it was issued, and the applicant paid the interim service assessment at the time the building permit was issued, the applicant may within 90 days of the expiration of the building permit apply for a refund of the interim service assessment. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the interim service assessment shall waive any right to a refund. 
(c)  The application for refund shall be filed with the City and contain the following: 
(1)  The name and address of the applicant; 
(2)  The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property which was the subject of the building permit; 
(3)  The date the service assessment was paid; 
(4)  A copy of the receipt of payment for the service assessment; and 
(5)  The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration. 
(d)  After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the building has not been completed, the City shall refund the interim service assessment paid for such building. 
(e)  A building permit which is subsequently issued for a building on the same property which was the subject of a refund shall pay the interim service assessment as required by this section.

(1)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act;

The City shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its service assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the City will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent service assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result of such delinquent service assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a service assessment imposed against government property may be collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such government property. The City Council may contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the City.

(3)  A permit will not be required when a public or private utility will perform work in the City right-of-way that will not cause damage to any City-owned or permitted feature within the right-of-way, provided, however, that the City Manager or designee is duly noticed in writing by the public or private utility that such work will be in progress and when completion is anticipated.

It shall be the responsibility of the City Manager or designee to provide notice to the affected permittees at the earliest possible time prior thereto of any such conflicts, whether actual, possible or planned. Where the owner requests additional time up to a maximum of 180 days, this may be granted by the office of the City Manager or designee upon receipt of a letter stating adequate grounds to support the owner's position that additional time is necessary to complete the relocation. If the extension of time requested by the owner is denied by the City Manager or designee or an extension in excess of 180 days is desired by the owner, the owner may appeal to the City Council by written request; and the time for relocation shall be stayed while the appeal is pending. Where the City has requested a relocation, permits will be required to approve the new sites of the utility facility, but permit fees shall be waived.

Sec. 26-40. - Time limits. 
(a)  Within seven (7) days after receipt of an application for a permit under this Article, the City Manager or designee shall review the application and shall request submittal of any additional information the City Manager or designee is permitted by law to require. If the applicant believes any request for additional information is not authorized by law or rule, the applicant may file an appeal to the City Council pursuant to Section 26-39. Within 15 days after receipt of such additional information, the director shall review it and may request only that information needed to clarify such additional information or to answer new questions raised by or directly related to such additional information. If the applicant believes the request of the City Manager or designee for such additional information is not authorized by law or rule, the City Manager or designee, at the applicant's request, shall proceed to process the permit application. Permits shall be approved or denied within 30 days after receipt of the original application, the last item of timely requested additional material, or the applicant's written request to begin processing the permit application. If the application is not approved or denied in writing within 30 days, it shall be deemed approved. Applications for permits may be denied solely on the basis of actual and irreconcilable conflict of the proposed work with City technical specifications or land development regulations. Any denial of an application must state the specific basis upon which the denial is based. The permit shall be considered valid for six (6) months beginning on the date of issuance unless the commencement date shall be beyond such time. If work does not commence by the end of this period, the permit shall be considered void and reapplication will be necessary. Work must be completed by the completion date indicated on the application unless the permit is extended upon request to the City Manager or designee with an explanation of the basis for such request. 
(b)  A request may be made to the City Manager or designee with the filing of an application for expedited review and processing; and provided that all information required as described in Subsection (a) of this section is submitted with said application, the director shall make a reasonable effort to review and process the same within five (5) days after receipt.

Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the City's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable law, including City ordinances, codes or regulations, including this Article. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the City shall file a single registration with the City that shall include the following information:

(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the City that the registrant will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in the public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way.

The registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the City may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The City may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits or may impose lesser requirements. 
(c)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide a proposal for construction of the communications facility that sets forth at least the following: 
(1)  An engineering plan signed and sealed by a Florida registered professional engineer, or prepared by a person who is exempt from such registration requirements as provided in Fla. Stat. § 471.003 identifying the location of the proposed facility, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and equipment that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods and/or techniques); 
(3)  A traffic maintenance plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way;

(7)  Such additional information requested by the City that the City finds reasonably necessary to review the permit application. 
(d)  The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or to accommodate City plans for public improvements or projects that the City determines are in the public interest. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and so as not to cause interference with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The registrant shall endeavor to install all communications facilities underground. The City may require the use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the collocation of facilities in existing conduit. In making such requests, the City shall take into consideration several factors including convenience to the public and other users of rights-of-way and the feasibility of such requests. The registrant shall be liable for the displacement, damage or destruction of any property, irrigation system or landscaping as a result of the placement or maintenance of its facility within the public rights-of-way.

The registrant shall warrant its restoration for a period of 12 months after completion of such restoration. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 calendar days after completion of construction, or such other time as may be reasonably required by the City, the City may after written notice to the registrant, perform such restoration using City employees, agents or contractors, and charge all costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with Fla. Stat. § 337.402 and require reimbursement within 30 days after the submission of the bill by the City to the registrant. 
(h)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the City of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of Fla. Stat. §§ 337.403 and 337.404. 
(i)  A permit from the City constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this Article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 556.

(Ord. No. 01-03-03, § 8, 3-13-2001) 
Sec. 26-78. - Termination of registration. 
(a)  The involuntary termination of a previously effective registration may only be accomplished by an action of the City Council. The City may declare the registration terminated and revoke and cancel all privileges granted under that registration if:

The obligations of the registrant hereunder shall survive the termination of a registration. In the event of a declaration of termination of registration, this provision does not permit the City to cause the removal of any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid certification or license with the governing Federal or State agency, where required, and is properly registered with the City, for such certificated service, where required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may, in its sole discretion, require increased or decreased levels of insurance, by way of individual license agreements, for any other object placed in the City's rights-of-way.

ARTICLE IV. - DEBRIS REMOVAL FROM PRIVATE STREETS, ROADS, ROADWAYS AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 

Sec. 26-91. - Intent and purpose. 
    After declaration of a state of emergency by either the President of the United States, the Governor of Florida or Monroe County, the primary mission of the City will be to protect lives and property, restore governmental services and clear public streets. Depending on the magnitude of the disaster and after accomplishment of the primary mission, resources may be available to the City that may not be available to a private property owner. The intent and purpose of this Article is to establish a process by which the City may evaluate and, if necessary, remove debris from along privately owned streets, roads, roadways, and other private property in the event of an immediate threat to life, public health and safety after a significant disaster. While the City recognizes that, as a general proposition, the removal of debris from private property is the responsibility of the property owner, there are occasions when, because of the magnitude of the disaster and the threat posed to life, health, and safety, there may be a compelling need to remove debris from private streets, roads, and roadways and other private property as described in this Section. 
(Ord. No. 2008-14, § 2, 7-8-2008) 
Sec. 26-92. - Definitions.

    Access properties means access to the properties depicted on the map entitled "maintained roads map", as it may be amended from time to time, maintained by and in the custody of the City Public Works Department, and incorporated herein as if fully set forth verbatim. Access shall be provided if: (1) the City is undertaking to clear and push debris; and (2) it is reasonably possible with respect to the equipment used to provide access under the circumstances. The maintained roads map represents the best efforts of the City to set forth a complete listing; however, due to the nature of the roadway system and the historical problems relating to documentation and memorialization of roadways and rights-of-way, the listing may not be all inclusive. 
    Canal means an artificial waterway constructed to allow the passage of boats, or other waterways inland. 
    Debris shall include, but is not limited to, displaced, broken, or discarded building and construction materials, garbage, vegetative matter and spoiled or ruined household goods or materials. 
    Private property means all property that is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity. 
    Private streets, roads and roadway shall include the rights-of-way as well as the improved surface that provides access to residential and commercial areas as identified as "private roadways" in the maintained roads map.

Sec. 26-93. - Private roadways. 
    The City shall remove debris from private roadways when such debris is determined to pose an immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community. The City Manager shall determine whether there is an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare sufficient to warrant removal of said debris in accordance with any one of the following standards: 
(1)  There is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential and commercial property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent City removal. 
(2)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause disease, illness, or sickness which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing and working in the area if it is allowed to remain. 
(3)  The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of City-wide utility services including, but not limited to, power, water, sewer, and telephone. 
(4)  The debris is determined by the City Building Official to be dangerous or hazardous. 
(5)  The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard. 
(6)  The debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or aquifer of the City. 
(7)  The debris has a substantial negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings and/or property. 
(8)  The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding areas of the City and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal. 
(9)  The debris poses a significant likelihood of, if left over time, producing mold which would be injurious to public health. 
(10)  The presence of the debris significantly adversely impacts the City's recovery efforts. 
(11)  The debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff, so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall. 
(12)  The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the City. 
(13)  The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed immediately. 
(14)  Commercial or other specific areas will be cleared if, in the opinion of the City Manager, the clearance will aid the City's recovery operations or aid the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the City.

(1)  The debris in the canals contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of impairing the waterways of the City. 
(2)  The debris in the canals, including submerged or partially submerged vessels and other debris, is rendering the canals impassible or extremely dangerous to vessels, preventing movement down the canals by first responders as well as citizens in the area.

Causes or events within the franchisee's control, and thus not falling within this section, shall include, without limitation, the franchisee's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance by any of the franchisee's directors, officers, employees, contractors, or agents.

(2)  Before imposing a fine pursuant to this Subsection (b) of this section, the City shall give the franchisee written notice of the violation and its intention to assess such damages, which notice shall contain a specific description of the alleged violation. Whenever practicable, the franchisee shall have 30 calendar days after notice to cure the violation and the City shall make good faith reasonable efforts to assist the franchisee in resolving the violation. If the violation is not cured within that 30-day period, the City may collect all fines owed, beginning with the first day of the violation, either by removing such amount from the security fund or through any other means allowed by law. 
(3)  In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity or provided in this division or in any franchise agreement, the City may apply any one (1) or a combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this chapter, or its franchise agreement:

(5)  Subject to applicable law, failure of the City to enforce any requirements of a franchise agreement or this division shall not constitute a waiver of the City's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
(6)  In any proceeding wherein there exists an issue with respect to a franchisee's performance of its obligations pursuant to this division, the franchisee has, throughout any such proceedings and appeals thereof, the burden of proving that said franchisee is in compliance with the terms of the division. The Council may find a franchisee that does not demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of this division in default and apply any one (1) or a combination of the remedies otherwise authorized by this division.

(a)  A franchise authorizes use of City streets for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, ducts, conductors, amplifiers, vaults, and other facilities as necessary and pertinent to operate a cable system to serve subscribers within the City, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install cables, wires, lines, underground conduit, or any other equipment or facilities upon private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible casements pursuant to Section 621 of the Communications Act, 47 USC 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners. 
(b)  A franchise is nonexclusive, and will not expressly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the City, or affect the City's right to authorize use of City streets to other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate. 
(c)  All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the streets, and the City reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the streets. Such designation may include, but not be limited to, consideration of the availability of space in the rights-of-way. 
(d)  A franchise shall be a privilege which is in the public trust. No transfer of a franchise shall occur without the prior consent of the City and unless application is made by the franchisee, and City approval obtained, pursuant to Section 30-66 and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  A franchise granted to an applicant pursuant to this article to construct, operate, and maintain a cable system within the City shall be deemed to constitute both a right and an obligation on the part of the franchisee to provide the services and facilities of a cable system as required by the provisions of this article and the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement shall incorporate by reference all of the provisions of the franchisee's application for the franchise that are finally negotiated and agreed upon by the City and the franchisee and all written representations and/or material made or provided by the franchisee in its application, public hearing, or in any correspondence between the City and the franchisee or the franchisee and any other person. All provisions of the franchisee's application and all written representations and/or material made or provided by the franchisee in its application, public hearing, or in any correspondence by the City and the franchisee or the franchisee and any other person shall be deemed to be material and made for the purpose of inducing the City to grant the franchise in the form accepted. 
(f)  Subject to applicable laws, in the event that a franchisee, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiary elects to offer to subscribers video programming services through any means or method not included within the definition of a cable system, including but not limited to an "open video system," the franchisee shall remain subject to all terms and conditions of the cable television franchise granted pursuant to this division. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 09, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-59. - Franchisee subject to other laws, police power. 
(a)  A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the City. 
(b)  Subject to applicable law, except as may be specifically provided in this division or under the terms of a franchise agreement and subject to the Communications Act, the failure of the City, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under this chapter or a franchise agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 10, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-60. - Interpretation of franchise terms; conflict. 
(a)  The provisions of this article shall be applied to franchisees in addition to the terms of any franchise agreement, they shall apply to a franchise agreement as if fully set forth in the franchise agreement, and the express terms of this article will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement unless such franchise agreement expresses an intent to amend or modify a requirement of this article. 
(b)  Except as to matters governed by Federal law or regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 11, 9-26-2000)

If the City elects to issue a request for proposals upon receipt of an unsolicited application, the applicant may submit an amended application in response to the request for proposals, or may inform the City that its unsolicited application should be considered in response to the request for proposals, or may withdraw its unsolicited application.

The filing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(d) of the Communications Act, 47 USC 542(g)(2)(d), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed in a franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 12, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-62. - Grant of franchise. 
(a)  The City may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. 
(b)  The City may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction, upgrades, or rebuilds of the cable system within a reasonably prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition may cause the franchise to become null and void or may require the franchisee to pay liquidated damages to the City as specified in the franchise agreement. 
(c)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the City may consider, among other things, the following factors: the applicant's technical, financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the adequacy of the proposed construction arrangements, facilities, equipment, and services based on the public convenience, safety, and welfare; the applicant's experience in constructing and operating cable systems and providing cable service in other communities, if any; the ability of City streets to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption to users of City streets and any resultant inconvenience to the public; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated needs and serve the public interest. Evaluation by the City shall not be based on the content of the programming the applicant proposes to provide. 
(d)  The City shall hold a public hearing to consider any application. The applicant shall be notified of the hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application, the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the City or staff, and any other information relevant to the application, the City shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny a franchise application and shall decide the terms and conditions of any franchise granted. Upon the grant of a franchise, the franchisee's application shall become an integral part of said franchise, and the franchisee shall be bound by the representations therein made. 
(e)  The Council shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 13, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-63. - Insurance; indemnity. 
(a)  A franchisee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the franchise agreement specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire term of the franchise including any renewals thereof, the following liability insurance coverage insuring the franchisee and naming the City as an additional insured: worker's compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all requirements of State law and general comprehensive liability insurance with respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the cable system, and the conduct of the franchisee's business in the City, in the minimum amounts of: 
(1)  One million dollars for property damage in any one (1) accident; 
(2)  One million dollars for personal bodily injury to any one (1) person; and 
(3)  One million dollars for personal bodily injury in any one (1) accident. 
(b)  All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the State; and shall be with sureties with a minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition. The City may request coverage and amounts in excess of the above minimums where demonstrated to reflect changing liability exposure and limits or where required by law. 
(c)  A franchisee shall keep on file with the City certificates of insurance, which certificates shall indicate evidence of payment of the required premiums and shall indicate that the City, its officers, boards, Council, Council Members, agents, and employees are listed as additional insureds. In the event of a potential claim such that the City claims insurance coverage, the franchisee shall immediately respond to all reasonable requests by the City for information with respect to the scope of the insurance coverage. 
(d)  All insurance policies shall name the City as an additional insured and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless 30 days prior written notice thereof has been given to the City. A franchisee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of proof that the franchisee has obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the City which complies with this division. 
(e)  A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City, its officials, boards, Council, Council Members, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief, and costs and expenses arising out of the construction, maintenance, and operation of its cable system, and the conduct of franchisee's business in the City, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this division or a franchise agreement, provided, however, that the franchisee's obligation hereunder shall not extend to any claims caused by the misconduct or sole negligence of the City, its officials, boards, Council, Council Members, agents, or employees. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the City's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceedings; and claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or providers of programs to be delivered by the cable system, claims arising out of Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 558, and claims against the franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm, or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm, or corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee may select counsel to represent the City. The City agrees to notify the franchisee, in writing, within ten (10) days of the City receiving notice of any issue it determines may require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the City from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 14, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-64. - Security fund. 
(a)  A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to the franchise becoming effective, the franchisee shall post with the City a security fund. Such fund may be in the form of a cash deposit, letter of credit, or corporate guarantee as agreed to in the franchise agreement. The security fund will be used to ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this article, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system. The amount of the security fund shall be the amount that the City determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that is necessary to protect the public, to provide adequate incentive to the franchisee to comply with this article and the franchise agreement, and to enable the City to enforce effectively compliance therewith. The franchise agreement shall provide for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund. Neither the posting of the cash deposit or filing of an indemnity bond or any form of surety bond with the City, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the City thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(b)  The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund or an indemnity bond are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this article or authorized by other law or the franchise agreement, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund or indemnity bond will affect any other right the City may have. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 15, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-65. - Renewal of franchise. 
    Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546. To the extent such additional requirements are consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, the following requirements shall apply: 
(1)  Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546, should that process be invoked, the City shall notify the franchisee, by certified or registered mail, that it may file a renewal application including a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which shall be no earlier than 60 calendar days following the date of the notice. 
a.  The application shall comply with the requirements of Section 30-61 and provide the specific information requested in the notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the date specified in the City's notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this subsection, the franchisee will be deemed not to be seeking renewal of its franchise. 
b.  Upon receipt of the renewal application, the City shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The City, following prior public notice, may hold one (1) or more public hearings on the renewal application. 
(2)  The Council shall consider the renewal application at a public hearing at which the Council will either: 
a.  Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the City and the franchisee; or 
b.  Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. 
(3)  If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the City will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(a)-(d) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546(c)(1)(a)-(d). Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with Subsection (b) of section 546 shall be based on one (1) or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in Section 546(c)(1)(a)-(d), pursuant to the record of proceedings under Section 546(c). The City shall not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under Section 546(c)(1)(a) or on events considered under Section 546(c)(1)(b) unless the City has provided the franchisee with notice and opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the City has waived its right to object, or the franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the City fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(4)  Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546(a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Cable Act, 47 USC 546(h). The City may hold one (1) or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the Council shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. 
(5)  If the Council grants a renewal application, the City and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 30-61(e) and (f), before such renewal becomes effective. 
(6)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied, the City may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system or effect a transfer to another person upon approval of the Council. The City may not acquire ownership of the system or approve a transfer to another person while an appeal of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to 47 USC 546(e). 
(7)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied and no appeal to a court is pending, and the City does not purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system to another person, the City may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the City may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 16, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-66. - Transfer of franchise. 
(a)  No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the City which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(b)  All applications for a transfer of a franchise shall meet the requirements of Section 30-61 and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. Except in the case of a pro forma transfer, the application shall provide, at a minimum, the information required in Subsections 30-61(e)(1)-(5), (13), and (14) with respect to the proposed transferee. The information required in Subsections 30-61(e)(6)-(12) shall also be provided whenever the proposed transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas. 
(c)  An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall be considered granted on the 61st calendar day following the filing of such application with the City unless, prior to that date, the City notifies the franchisee to the contrary. An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall clearly identify the application as such, describe the proposed transaction, and explain why the applicant believes the transfer is pro forma. Unless otherwise requested by the City within ten (10) business days of the filing of an application for a pro forma transfer, the applicant shall be required only to provide the information required in Subsections 30-61(e)(1), (3) with respect to the proposed transferee. 
(d)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the Council shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in substantial compliance with the material terms of its franchise agreement and this article and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest. 
(e)  No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this article and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations of the previous franchisee under this article and the franchise agreement. 
(f)  Approval by the City of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this article or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(Ord. No. 00-09-09, § 17, 9-26-2000) 
Sec. 30-67. - Revocation or termination of franchise. 
(a)  A franchise may be revoked by the Council for a franchisee's failure to construct, operate, or maintain the cable system as required by this article or the franchise agreement, or for any other material violation of this article or material breach of the franchise agreement. To invoke the provisions of this subsection, the City shall give the franchisee written notice, by certified mail at the last known address, that the franchisee is in material violation of this article or in material breach of the franchise agreement and describing the nature of the alleged violation or breach with specificity. If within 30 calendar days following receipt of such written notice from the City to the franchisee the franchisee has not cured such violation or breach, or has not commenced corrective action and such corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the City may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to revoke the franchise, stating its reasons. 
(b)  Prior to revoking a franchise under Subsection (a) of this section, the Council shall hold a public hearing, upon 30 calendar days notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard.

A franchisee shall provide access channels dedicated to the exclusive use of the City and such other support for educational, and/or governmental use as required in a franchise agreement. At any time the initial channel provided to the City by a franchisee is programmed during at least eight (8) hours per day with locally produced nonduplicative programming (i.e., bulletin boards shall not be considered programming for purposes of this section) Monday through Friday for six (6) consecutive weeks, the franchisee shall, without charge, at the request of the City, provide the City with a second access channel.

The City shall not allow the programming on the initially provided channels to fall below the specified level when additional channels have been activated. In the event the programming on the initially provided access channels falls below the amount specified above, then the City agrees that the franchisee shall have the right to deactivate the subsequently provided channel. 
(3)  The City may require in a franchise agreement that the franchisee provide live cablecasting of Council meetings in their entirety to all of the franchisee's subscribers located within the City. The cablecasting of such meetings shall be replayed at times as specified in the franchise agreement. 
(4)  A cable system shall provide leased access channels as required by Federal law. 
(5)  The franchisee shall provide to every local government building, public school (K-12), private school (K-12), and public library, upon written request, at least one (1) cable outlet, which includes basic cable service and expanded basic cable service or its equivalent, within its franchise area at no cost to the City or school involved.

For illustrative purposes only, if there are three (3) franchised cable operators in the City and the cost to interconnect and provide PEG Access programming equals $1,200.00 per month, then each cable operator is responsible for $400.00 per month. If the franchisees, at the date upon which the City may require interconnection, are unable to agree on such interconnection arrangements, then the franchisees shall submit to mediation. The City at its discretion shall have the right to appoint a mediator and retain such other consultants as may be reasonably required including, but not limited to, attorneys, accountants, and engineers. All costs incurred by the City in this regard shall be paid by the franchisees equally.

All other franchisees shall share in the cost of producing and delivering the live cablecasting to all subscribers on an equal basis. In the event that the City elects to change the location from which the live cablecastings provided prior to the fifth anniversary of the effective date hereof, the City hereby agrees to reimburse franchisees for the incremental cost of the construction of the plant required to provide the live cablecasting from the initial location, at 20 percent of the total cost of construction of the plant for each year of the five-year period during which the location has changed from the initial location. 
(f)  The franchisee shall provide, at the franchisee's cost, trained personnel and all necessary equipment and cabling to provide to the City production of character generation and cablecasting thereof.

(1)  In an amount up to a maximum of either five percent (5%) of the franchisee's gross revenues derived directly or indirectly from the operation of its cable system within the City to provide cable services during the term of its franchise; or 
(2)  In the event the Cable Act or other applicable law is amended to permit the City to assess a franchise fee of a greater amount than that specified in Subsection (a)(1) of this section, the franchisee agrees to pay to the City the new amount after a public hearing in which the public and franchisee are given an opportunity to comment on the impact of the higher fee. 
(b)  A franchisee shall pay the franchise fee due to the City on a quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the City not later than 30 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter.

The statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or the franchisee's chief financial or other duly authorized officer. The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
(d)  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the City of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable. 
(e)  The franchise fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any other tax, fee, or assessment. 
(f)  The City may, from time to time, but not more frequently than annually, upon reasonable notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and may recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise, subject to the applicable statute of limitations.

The City may issue such rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a cable system installed in, on, or over the streets, as may be consistent with this article and the franchise agreement. 
(g)  All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance, and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment, or fixtures where they will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer, or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents of the City of their use of any street or any other public right-of-way. 
(h)  A franchisee shall, at all times: 
(1)  Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures, and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the City's Florida Building Code and any other applicable standards, and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of the City. 
(2)  Keep and maintain in a safe, suitable, and substantial condition, and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment, and connections in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways or places of the City, wherever situated or located. 
(i)  On streets where both electrical and telephone utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located underground at the franchisee's expense. If funds are available to any person using the public right-of-way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall reimburse the franchisee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement are reimbursed. Between a street and a subscriber's residence, a franchisee's drop must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. The City shall encourage, to the extent feasible, that the public utility and the franchisee cooperate in opening up trenches and making such trenches available to all parties with the understanding that the costs of opening and refilling of such trenches would be shared equally by all users of such trenches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the franchisee shall install underground extensions of lines in new residential subdivisions over five (5) units or new multiple occupancy buildings where all other utilities will also be installed underground. Such installation shall be provided in accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable law, including, but not limited to, any requirements applicable to the applicant for such services, such as the provision of necessary rights-of-way or easements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the franchisee shall not be required to construct, maintain or operate underground any ground-mounted appurtenances, except and unless such requirements are permitted by law. The franchisee shall grant to the City, free of charge, the joint use of any and all poles owned by the franchisee so long as such use by the City does not interfere with the operation of the cable system. 
(j)  In the event the use of any part of a cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street without complying with the requirements of this article or a franchise agreement, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled, or expired, the franchisee, within 30 days after written notice by the City, shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the City may require. 
(k)  The City may extend the time for the removal of the franchisee's equipment and facilities for a period not to exceed 180 days, and thereafter such equipment and facilities may be deemed abandoned. In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee shall restore the area to as good a condition as prior to such removal or abandonment.

If the installation was to have been provided free of charge or if the appointment was for service or repair, the subscriber shall receive a credit on his bill of not less than $20.00. 
(h)  Disconnection. 
(1)  Voluntary disconnection. 
a.  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
b.  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests from the franchisee's cable system. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. So long as the subscriber returns equipment within three (3) business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any franchisee for such voluntary disconnection, or for any cable services delivered after the date of disconnect request. 
c.  A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect the franchisee's equipment and return it to the business office. 
d.  Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after equipment including all converters but excluding wiring from a customer's premises have been recovered by the franchisee. The refund process shall take a maximum of 30 days from the date disconnection was completed to the date the customer receives the refund. 
(2)  Involuntary disconnection. If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until 35 days after the due date of the monthly subscriber fee or other charge, and ten (10) days' advance written notice of intent to disconnect to the subscriber in question. If the subscriber pays within 35 days of the due date and after notice of disconnection has been given, the franchisee shall not disconnect. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall reinstate service. 
(3)  Other disconnection. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the franchisee from removing its property from a subscriber's premises upon the termination of service consistent with FCC rules and regulations and any other applicable law. At the subscriber's request, a franchisee shall remove its cable from the subscriber's premises within 30 calendar days of the subscriber's request. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable or internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise, provided, however, that such agreement must be consistent with applicable law and FCC rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a franchisee shall comply with all FCC rules as now or hereafter may be amended with respect to subscribers' rights and interests including, but not limited to, right to purchase and determination of ownership of cable wiring and equipment. 
(i)  Intentional service interruptions. The franchisee shall intentionally interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.

(k)  Employee badges. The franchisee shall cause all its field employees to wear a picture identification badge indicating their employment by the franchisee. This badge shall be clearly visible to the public. 
(l)  Complaint procedures. A franchisee shall develop written procedures for the investigation and resolution of all subscriber or City resident complaints, including, but not limited to, those regarding the quality of service and equipment malfunction, which procedures shall be subject to the review and approval by the City Manager or designee. A subscriber or City resident who has not been satisfied by following the franchisee's procedures may file a written complaint with the City, who will investigate the matter and, in consultation with the franchisee as appropriate, attempt to resolve the matter. A franchisee's good faith or lack thereof in attempting to resolve subscriber and resident complaints in a fair and equitable manner will be considered in connection with the franchisee's renewal application. The franchisee shall maintain a complete list of all complaints not resolved within seven (7) days of receipt and the measures taken to resolve them. This list shall be compiled in a form to be approved by the City. It shall be compiled on a monthly basis. The list for each calendar month shall be supplied to the City upon the City's request no later than the 15th day of the next month. The franchisee shall also maintain a list of all complaints received for a period of 24 months, which list will be available to the City upon the City's request. 
(m)  Inspection of equipment. The franchisee shall permit the City designee to inspect and test the system's technical equipment and facilities upon reasonable notice not to be less than 48 hours. 
(n)  Communications with customers, bills, and refunds. The franchisee shall abide by the following requirements governing communications with customers, bills, and refunds: 
(1)  Each franchisee shall provide to subscribers written information in each of the following areas at the time of installation, at least once annually, and at any future time upon request by the subscriber: 
a.  How to use the cable service; 
b.  Installation and service maintenance policies; 
c.  The products and services offered; 
d.  Prices and service options; 
e.  Channel positions of programming carried on the system; 
f.  The franchisee's procedures for the receipt and resolution of customer complaints, the franchisee's address and telephone number to which complaints may be reported, and the hours of operation; 
g.  The telephone number and address of the City's office and, as required by City ordinance, the City's office designated to handle cable complaints and inquiries shall be printed on the back of the bill; 
h.  The availability of a "lock-out" device; 
i.  The franchisee's information, collection, and disclosure policies for the protection of a subscriber's privacy. 
(2)  The franchisee's bills will be clear, concise, and understandable. All charges shall be separately itemized on the bill. 
(3)  Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than the earlier of 30 days or the customer's next billing cycle following the resolution of a refund request, or the return of the equipment supplied by the franchisee if service is terminated. 
(4)  Credits for service will be issued no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(5)  If the change is within the control of the franchisee, a franchisee shall provide subscribers and the Council with at least 30 days' advance written notice of any changes in rates, charges, channel lineup, or initiations or discontinuations or changes of service or services offered over the cable system. A franchisee shall provide notice of such changes not within its control to subscribers and the City as soon thereafter as practical. 
(o)  Service credits for outages. Upon request, a franchisee shall provide each individual subscriber a prorated 24-hour credit to the subscriber's account for any period of eight (8) hours or more within a 24-hour period during which a subscriber experienced an outage of service or substantial impairment of service, whether due to a system malfunction or other cause within the control of the franchisee. 
(p)  Billing . 
(1)  The franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(2)  The franchisee's billing statement must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
(3)  The franchisee's billing statement must show a specific due date not earlier than ten (10) days after the date of the beginning of the service period. Any balance not received within ten (10) days after the due date may be assessed an administrative charge as a late fee. Any administrative charge imposed as a "late fee" must be reasonable and must be limited to a fair approximation of the actual cost of handling and collecting the customer bill. Franchisees shall use late fees for cost recovery only and not as a tool of profit for the collection of additional revenues, or as a penalty or deterrent. For any late fee charged to subscribers in excess of $5.00 per billing period, the franchisee shall bear the burden of proving that such late fee is reasonable. 
a.  Any administrative charge applied to unpaid bills shall be subject to regulation by the City consistent with applicable law. 
b.  Subscribers shall not be charged an administrative fee or a late fee, or be otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors, to bill timely or correctly the subscriber or to credit properly the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(4)  The franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit payment in person at the franchisee's office and must inform the subscriber of the address of that office. 
(q)  Alteration of service. A franchisee may not substantially alter the service being provided to a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier, or otherwise) without the express permission of such subscriber, unless it complies with this subsection. 
(1)  Any time a franchisee intends to alter the service being provided to a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier, or otherwise) in such a way that the subscriber will no longer be able to obtain the same package of services in the same manner and at the same cost, the franchisee must provide the subscriber with 30 days' written notice of such alteration. The notice shall explain the substance and the full effect of the alteration and provide the subscriber the right, within the 30-day period following notice, to opt to receive any combination of services offered by the franchisee. 
(2)  Except as provided herein, or under applicable Federal or State law, no charge may be made for any service or product which the subscriber has not affirmatively indicated, in a manner separate and apart from payment of the regular monthly bill, that he or she wishes to receive. 
(r)  Certification of compliance. The franchisee shall certify in writing to the City on January 1 and July 1 of each year based upon internal due diligence by the franchisee that to the best of the franchisee's knowledge that it is in substantial compliance with the standards of this section. If the City believes the franchisee is not in compliance with any provision, the City may require the franchisee to submit such documentation as may be required to demonstrate the franchisee's compliance with such provision. This documentation shall be submitted within 45 days of the franchisee's receipt of the City request unless extended by the City. 
(s)  Administration. The City Manager or designee, shall have the responsibility for the administration of this article and any franchise granted hereunder. Such responsibility shall include the resolution of all complaints against a franchisee regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and related matters, including the authority to order credits, refunds or fines. The City Manager or designee may settle or compromise any controversy arising from operations of the franchisee, either on behalf of the City, the franchisee, or any subscriber, in accordance with the terms of this article and the franchise agreement. 
(1)  Notice of decision . Any decision made by the City shall be provided to the franchisee in writing and delivered pursuant to Section 30-3. The franchisee shall have 30 days from receipt of such written decision to respond in writing to such decision. 
(2)  Authority to require service. In cases where requests for service have been ignored or where the service provided is unsatisfactory for any reason, the City Manager or designee shall have the power to require the franchisee to provide service if in the opinion of the City Manager or designee, such request for service is reasonable. 
(3)  Appeal of City Manager or designee's decision. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager or designee, including the franchisee, may appeal the matter to the Council for hearing and determination. The Council may accept, reject, or modify the decision of the City Manager or designee. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise, whether instituted by the City Manager or designee or by the Council, shall be contrary to the provisions of this article or any franchise agreement issued pursuant to this article, and neither the City Manager or designee nor the Council, in the adjustment, settlement, or compromise of any controversy, shall have the right or authority to add to, modify, or delete any provision of this article or of the franchise agreement, or to interfere with any rights of subscribers or any franchisee under applicable Federal or State law or private contract. 
(t)  Enforcement. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking action to protect the health, safety or welfare of the public or to prevent eminent danger of damage to property. Enforcement of the standards shall be governed by the following: 
(1)  In addition to the powers delegated in Subsection (s) of this section, the City Manager or designee shall have the authority to order credits from a franchisee to individual cable subscribers (or refunds to former subscribers) who have submitted a written complaint to the City, to deny a subscriber's complaint, and/or to assess fines against a franchisee for any violation of this article or any franchise issued pursuant to this article, which fines will be paid to the City. Provided, however, that any person aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager or designee, including the franchisee or subscriber, may appeal to the Council for hearing and determination.

(4)  Prior to ordering a credit and/or assessing a fine, the City Manager or designee shall mail the franchisee written notice by certified or registered mail of the violation and his intention to assess such damages, which notice shall contain a specific description of the alleged violation. Following receipt of such notice, the franchisee shall cure or commence to cure such violation. Final cure of a violation shall toll the accrual of assessed fines and credits. The franchisee shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the written notice to file a written response to the City Manager's or designee's notice. The City and the franchisee shall make good faith reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in question. The franchisee's written response shall be signed by management level personnel of the franchisee.

The City Manager or designee may, after consideration of the response of the franchisee, waive or reduce any proposed credit or fine. In the case of a violation of this article or any franchise issued pursuant to this article, the City Manager or designee may not assess any fine if the franchisee has reasonably resolved the complaint or cured the violation within a reasonable timeframe not to exceed 15 days. Such time period may be extended for good cause shown. 
(6)  Subsequent to the notice of proposed refund and/or fine to the franchisee and consideration of the franchisee's response, if any, the City Manager or designee may issue an assessment of refund or fine. The refund and/or fine shall be paid within 30 days of written notice to the franchisee. The City may enforce payment of the refund or fine in any court having jurisdiction.

In the event a law enforcement officer needs a tow truck for a towable violation, and once the towing service has been requested by the officer at the violation site and the operator has advised the officer that he is en route to the request, should the owner or driver of the motor vehicle in violation return to the vehicle site before the wrecker operator has arrived at the motor vehicle, or before the wrecker operator has departed with the vehicle, and upon the officer's authorization to release the vehicle to the owner or driver then the owner or driver of the vehicle shall pay a charge of not more than one-half (1/2) of the maximum rate for the class of towing service called for 
(2)  The provisions of this Subsection (d) only apply to the rates charged for towing and storage service called for at the request of a law enforcement officer.

(3)  Every wrecker operator shall conspicuously display at his place of business the maximum charges which he may impose for the towing and storage services covered by this subsection. 
(e)  Storage facilities . 
(1)  Wrecker operators shall provide storage facilities, which shall be maintained at the wrecker operator's place of business. These facilities must be fenced and locked for the protection of vehicles and property. 
(2)  The wrecker operator shall provide storage for all impounded/towed vehicles in an outside storage area unless the impounding law enforcement officer gives specific written instructions for inside storage. If required for investigative purposes, the wrecker operator shall move the vehicle to a designated area for processing prior to storage. In such instance, the law enforcement agency will not authorize release of the vehicle until all outstanding charges by the wrecker operator, as authorized by this section, have been satisfied. 
(3)  The wrecker operator shall not change the type of storage facility (inside or outside) afforded a vehicle without written permission from the district captain or other officer in charge. The wrecker operator shall not change the storage facility location without first obtaining written permission from the district captain or other officer in charge. 
(4)  The storage facility must be owned or leased solely by the wrecker operator and vehicles stored by the wrecker operator must be separately fenced and locked. 
(5)  The registered owner of a vehicle or the owner's representatives or owner's insurance adjusters, upon proper identification, shall be permitted to inspect or photograph stored vehicles during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

(7)  Permanent inside storage facilities must be available for 24-hour storage when weather or other conditions require inside storage for the protection of the vehicle or personal property. A lean-to, tent or shed does not meet the requirements of this section. Inside storage must be within a weather-tight building. 
(8)  A minimum of 25 storage spaces with three (3) inside storage spaces must be available. Wrecker operators who have been on a rotation system for the Florida Highway Patrol or the Monroe County Sheriff's Department for six (6) months prior to the effective date of this rule may continue on the list without regard to the minimum storage spaces required herein, so long as all other applicable provisions of these rules are met. Service bays or repair bays do not qualify as inside storage, nor does any area that is utilized for any activity other than serving as a permanent inside storage area, when vehicles are actually stored inside at the request of a law enforcement agency or the owner of a vehicle. 
(9)  Wrecker operators shall comply with hold orders placed by the law enforcement agency, including any instructions for inside or outside storage. Vehicles involved in a fatality and sealed by the traffic homicide investigator shall remain intact until the seals are removed by the investigator. No property of any kind shall be released to anyone without authority of the homicide investigator. If no fatality occurred, then the wrecker operator may release the vehicle and the property upon valid proof of ownership once the hold is released. 
(10)  A copy of an inventory prepared by the law enforcement agency, of all personal property found in a wrecked, disabled or abandoned vehicle shall be provided to the wrecker operator. The wrecker operator shall permit the removal of such property by the vehicle owner or his agent from a stored vehicle during normal business hours without charge. The agent's authority shall be evidenced by a writing acknowledged by the owner before a notary public or other person empowered by law to administer oaths. A signed receipt for each article removed by the owner or his agency shall be obtained. The term "personal property" shall be defined as any item not affixed to the vehicle that was in the vehicle at the time of the tow. In the case of vehicles stored where no "hold order" has been placed, the wrecker operator will directly release any vehicle upon presentation of proper proof of identification and ownership. If these conditions cannot be met due to unusual or extraordinary circumstances, the vehicle will be released only upon authorization obtained from the law enforcement agency. 
(11)  Wrecker operators handling the initial tow shall exercise reasonable care and control of parts and contents located in vehicles while under their protection or while in storage. 
(12)  During the hours from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, wrecker operators will provide adequate staffing at the storage facility so that personal property may be removed from the vehicle or the vehicle itself may be released without undue delay. 
(13)  Should it become necessary that personal property be removed from a vehicle or a vehicle be released when the storage facility is not staffed, the wrecker operator will be required to do so and will be allowed to charge a reasonable fee.

(k)  Fees. 
(1)  No wrecker operator may charge any fee for the towing of a vehicle in excess of the fees established by resolution of the Marathon City Council for wrecker services.

(j)  Inflow and Infiltration Ordinance 2016-02 further regulates influent characteristics, including grease, and states penalties for any non-compliance. 
(k)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any materials which exert or cause: 
(1)  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, such as but not limited to fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues, or of dissolved solids, such as but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. 
(2)  Excessive discoloration, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(3)  Unusual or excessive BOD or chemical oxygen demand exceeding 500 mg/l, or in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works. 
(4)  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined under 40 CFR 403.5(b). 
(5)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(l)  Actions of City Manager for potentially harmful wastes. 
(1)  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which, in the judgment of the City Manager, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City Manager may: 
a.  Reject the wastes; 
b.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
c.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
d.  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, i.e.: 
1.  The wastewater discharge from certain facilities, even when passed through properly sized and maintained grease interceptors, may contain elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand "BOD". A surcharge may be applied to the customer's wastewater services bill for wastewater discharges with a BOD in excess of 500 parts per million. The surcharge will be applied at a rate to be adopted from time to time in a rate resolution by the City Council. 
(2)  If the City Manager permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Manager and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. 
a.  The Utility Director shall notify the City Manager in writing of conditions present to which actions in this section are applicable. 
(m)  Measurements, testing and analyses of wastes. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the City's point of connection provided or upon suitable samples taken at the owner's list station or buffer tank. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of the premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs and salinities are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(n)  Special agreements between City and industrial users. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment agreed upon by the industrial concern and the City.

(a)  If a customer has been assessed a System Development Charge based on a certain number of EDUs, and, subsequent to such assessment, the customer changes the use of the property so as to permanently reduce the potable water usage, the customer may apply to the City for a formal recognition of the number of excess EDUs resulting from this change and approval of the transfer of those EDUs to another specific property located in the City. The Utility Director shall establish the form of application, the applicable criteria and any fees or cost recovery associated therewith. 
(b)  EDUs can only be transferred to a property located in a service area in the City if that service area has sufficient capacity to handle the wastewater flow that corresponds to the EDUs, as determined in writing by the Utility Director in his sole discretion. 
(c)  If EDUs are transferred off a property to another specific property in the City and the customer transferring the property had not prepaid the assessment amount in full, the City will recalculate the annual assessment payments for both the transferring property and the recipient property. Such recalculated amounts will be reflected in the assessment resolution for the following fiscal year. If the owner of the recipient property wishes to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the assessment in full, said owner may do so at the then prevailing prepayment rate as determined by the City. 
(d)  If EDUs are transferred off a property to another specific property in the City and the customer transferring the property had prepaid the assessment amount in full, there will be no recalculation of the annual assessment payments and there will be no refunds from the City. 
(e)  If EDUs are transferred off a property, any subsequent change in the use of said property that will permanently increase its potable water usage must be approved by the City and will result in a recalculation of the assessment payments for the property. 
(f)  The transfer of the EDUs must be reflected in a document to be recorded in the chain of title of both the transferring property and the recipient property. 
(g)  Nothing in this section creates any obligation of the City to buy or otherwise acquire EDUs from any property, or otherwise assume the obligation to pay assessments on behalf of any property.

ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER SYSTEM 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
[2]
Footnotes: 

Sec. 34-68. - Purpose, intent, and findings. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Marathon by establishing a stormwater utility responsible for the financing, construction, operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities; for stormwater system planning; for coordinated review of development plans for compliance with stormwater regulations; and ensuring the protection and enhancement of the City's nearshore waters. Further, the City finds more specifically that: 
(1)  The City is located in the middle of the Florida Keys archipelago, which contains environmental and natural resources of such Statewide importance the Florida Legislature declared it to be an area of critical state concern under Fla. Stat. ch. 380; and 
(2)  As a result of its inclusion within the Florida Keys Area of Critical State Concern, the City is statutorily obligated to limit the adverse impacts of development on the quality of its nearshore waters and to protect and improve water quality by providing for the construction, operation, maintenance, and replacement of stormwater management facilities; and 
(3)  The Federal and State government ordered the City to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") requirements or face financial penalties, the suspension of Federal and State grant funding, and a possible building moratoria; and 
(4)  Stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into the City's nearshore waters, thereby degrading water quality; and 
(5)  The increase in nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen, accelerates eutrophication of the City's nearshore waters, thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna; and 
(6)  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation; and 
(7)  The alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion; and 
(8)  Siltation of the City's nearshore waters resulting from increased erosion interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna; and 
(9)  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff, and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge; and 
(10)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff from developed and undeveloped property may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur thereby endangering property and human life; and 
(11)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff from developed and undeveloped property may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity; and 
(12)  Substantial economic losses will result from such adverse impacts upon the City's nearshore waters ecosystem; and 
(13)  Sound stormwater management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the City's nearshore waters; and 
(14)  The City maintains a system of stormwater management facilities including, but not limited to, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, swales, infiltration facilities, and other components that need regular maintenance and improvements; and 
(15)  All real property in the City benefits from this stormwater system. 
(b)  This article is intended to comply with Federal and State law and regulations regarding water quality and has the following objectives: 
(1)  To establish a stormwater utility and management program within the City responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of City stormwater devices and facilities; for stormwater system planning; for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management regulations; and for nearshore water quality management; and 
(2)  To adopt stormwater service assessments sufficient to plan, construct, operate, and maintain stormwater management facilities throughout the City; and 
(3)  To protect, restore, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the City's nearshore waters; and 
(4)  To prevent individuals, business organizations, companies, and governments from causing harm to the community, by activities which adversely affect water resources; and 
(5)  To encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems; and 
(6)  To encourage the protection of natural systems, and the use of such natural systems in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning; and 
(7)  To minimize the transport of pollutants to the City's nearshore waters; and 
(8)  To minimize erosion and sedimentation; and 
(9)  To prevent damage to wetlands; and 
(10)  To reduce damage from flooding, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial; and 
(11)  To protect, restore, and maintain the City's nearshore habitat of flora and fauna; and 
(12)  To ensure the attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of a stormwater management program for all activities, which have an adverse impact upon the City's nearshore waters.

Sec. 34-98. - Assessment role and schedule of rates. 
(a)  Pursuant to the home rule power of Article VIII, Section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, Chapter 166, Florida Statutes and Chapter 24 of the Marathon Code, the City Manager is directed to prepare a list of all parcels within the City and assign a classification of residential, nonresidential, undeveloped, or exempt to each parcel, which list shall constitute the annual stormwater utility assessment roll. Such roll shall contain a summary description of each parcel in the City setting forth the name and address of the owner of each such parcel; the assessment classification applicable to each parcel of real property as specified in the rate resolution; and the amount of the annual stormwater utility fee or assessment applicable to each such parcel. 
(b)  The City Manager shall be responsible for determining the impervious area based on data supplied by the Monroe County Property Appraiser, or by the property owner, tenant or developer if such information is unavailable from the Property Appraiser. The City Manager may require additional information as necessary to determine the impervious area of a parcel. The annual stormwater assessment amount shall be updated by the City Manager based on any additions or deletions to the impervious area of a parcel. 
(c)  On or before the 15th day of September of the first year the stormwater service assessment is imposed the City Council shall, at any regular or special meeting, review the stormwater utility assessment roll prepared by the City Manager for its conformity with the rate resolution provided for in Section 34-97; and make such changes or additions as necessary to conform such roll with the rate resolution.

All requests shall be reviewed based on the amount of impervious area on the parcel, or additional/enhanced stormwater facilities. No credit shall be given for the installation of facilities required by City or County development codes or Federal or State water quality regulations and stormwater rules. The following procedures shall apply to all adjustment requests of the stormwater service assessment: 
(1)  Any property owner may submit an adjustment request to the City Manager. A condition precedent to the submission of an adjustment request is the payment of all unpaid stormwater service assessments. 
(2)  Adjustment requests shall be in writing and set forth, in detail, the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
(3)  Adjustments resulting from such request shall be retroactive for assessment refunds, but refunds shall not exceed one (1) year of imposed assessments. 
(4)  The property owner requesting the adjustment may be required by the City, at property owner's own cost, to provide supplemental information to the City Manager including, but not limited to, facts, professional opinions or engineering studies to substantiate the adjustment request. 
(5)  Adjustments to the stormwater service assessment will be made upon the granting of the adjustment request in writing by the City Manager. Denials of adjustment requests shall be made in writing by the City Manager. 
(6)  Should an adjustment be granted to a lesser number of ERUs and the property owner later increases the number of lots or parcels to be developed, assessments that would have otherwise been imposed in fiscal year 2014-2015 (or such fiscal year in which the original adjustment is made), and each year thereafter, shall be due from the property owner as a condition of increasing the number of ERUs. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the written denial of the adjustment request, the owner who initially requested the adjustment may, within 30 days of receipt of such denial, appeal to the City Council for review of the denial. 
(1)  The City Council shall complete its review within 60 days of receipt of said request for appeal. The City Council's determination on the appeal shall be in writing and set forth in detail the reason for its decision.

(d)  No act of omission or commission on the part of the Monroe County Property Appraiser, Monroe County Tax Collector, the City Council, or City Manager shall operate to defeat the required payment of the annual stormwater utility assessment imposed by the City Council under the provisions of this article. Provided, however, any acts of omissions or commission may be corrected at any time by the officer or party responsible, and when so corrected they shall be construed to be valid ab initio and shall in no way affect any process by law for the enforcement of the annual stormwater service assessments imposed under the provisions of this article. 
(e)  The City Council shall have the authority, at any time, upon its own initiative or in response to an adjustment request from any affected owner of real property, to correct any error of omission or commission in the adoption of any annual stormwater service assessment roll, or in the implementation of this article, and make necessary adjustments thereto, subject to the one (1) year refund limitation in Subsection (a)(3) herein. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20, § 2, 12-16-2014) 
Sec. 34-101. - Capital contributions. 
    Procedures and standards developed by the City Manager shall define appropriate means by which to optimize development capital contributions in the implementation of basic specific stormwater systems. These basic specific capital contributions shall take the form of "service assessment-in-lieu-of" or "availability charges." Each situation will be analyzed by the City Manager, and a specific written decision will be developed. The application is defined as follows: 
(1)  "Service assessment-in-lieu-of" is applied to a site-specific negotiated procedure, wherein a development's stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) is assessed its share of the capital needs of the facilities required to serve the development in question. This capital contribution would be used to implement City-owned stormwater facilities. The process does not apply wherein the stormwater facilities are privately held. Each application is evaluated against the City's stormwater master plan for the watershed involved or, while the master plan is incomplete, the cumulative impacts from the development. 
(2)  "Availability charge" is administered on a site-specific basis identical to the service assessment-in-lieu-of procedure noted above; the only difference is that the capital investment advanced by the City in implementing a stormwater facility is not recovered through an availability charge. The capital charge is determined on a pro rata share of the capacity used by the new applicant or by the cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20, § 2, 12-16-2014) 
Sec. 34-102. - Stormwater utility enterprise fund. 
    There shall be established a stormwater utility enterprise fund for the deposit of all service assessment and charges collected by the stormwater service assessment. These funds shall be for the exclusive use of the City's stormwater utility including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Stormwater management services, such as studies, design, permit review, plan preparation and development review. 
(2)  Operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the stormwater collection, storage, treatment and conveyance infrastructure. 
(3)  Project costs related to constructing major or minor structural improvements to the stormwater system infrastructure as provided in the Citywide stormwater management plan. 
(4)  Administrative costs associated with the management of the stormwater service assessment. A maximum of ten (10) percent of the annual stormwater utility fund may be transferred to the general fund annually for administrative costs. 
(5)  Debt service financing of stormwater-related capital improvements defined in the Citywide stormwater management plan. 
(6)  Funding of studies including water quantity and quality monitoring, aerial photography, and geotechnical work associated with the planning of the stormwater system infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20, § 2, 12-16-2014)

Chapter 100 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL 

Section 100.00. - Title. 
    The rules and regulations hereby adopted shall be known and cited as the "the City of Marathon Land Development Regulations or "the LDRs". 
Section 100.01. - Authority. 
    The City of Marathon Land Development Regulations are adopted by City ordinance, pursuant to the requirements and authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 163, Part II (the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act), the general powers confirmed in Fla. Stat. ch. 166 (Home Rules Powers Act) and the Constitution of the State of Florida. 
Section 100.02. - Purpose and intent. 
    The City has developed these land development regulations to implement the Comprehensive Plan and to protect the character, environment and viability through: 
A.  Protection of the small town family feel of the community; 
B.  Continued utilization of the established mixed-use pattern of the community; 
C.  Protection of the heritage of the commercial fishing industry; 
D.  Acknowledgement and protection of a character that is unique to the Keys; 
E.  Protection of existing and increased affordable housing opportunities; 
F.  Implementation of effective surface water management strategies; 
G.  Systematic removal of failing and inadequate on-site wastewater disposal systems; 
H.  Implementation and installation of a central wastewater facility; 
I.  Protection and enhancement of sensitive upland, wetland and submerged land habitat; 
J.  Protection for the existing uses, densities and intensities; 
K.  Providing new investment and reinvestment opportunities; 
L.  Ensuring new development and redevelopment protects the environment; 
M.  Ensuring new and redevelopment compliments and enhances community character; and 
N.  Implementation of thoughtful controlled growth. 
    The LDRs set forth regulations, requirements and procedures governing the use and development of land for the purpose of protecting the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City and to enhance the appearance, function and livability of the City, to the end of improving the overall quality of life within the community. 
    As required by Fla. Stat. 163.3202, the LDRs contain specific and detailed provisions which regulate the subdivision of land, the use of land and water, areas subject to flooding, environmentally sensitive lands, signage, and stormwater management. The LDRs also require that all development be reviewed for its impact on public facilities and services to ensure that adopted levels-of-service are maintained. 
Section 100.03. - Applicability. 
    Except as specifically provided in this Article, the provisions of these LDRs shall apply to all development in the City. 
Section 100.04. - Generally. 
    Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in the LDRs, all applicable standards and requirements of the LDRs shall apply to all structures and uses within the City, including, but not limited to the construction, moving, placement, erection, or alteration of any building or structure; the use or occupancy of any building or land; the disturbance of any water; and the development and division of land. 
    All provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in the LDRs shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the City Council may be fully carried out. 
A.  Exceptions: 
1.  Previously Issued Development Permits: The provisions of these land development regulations and any amendments thereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective development permit prior to the date of these adopted regulations (which shall be February 13, 2007) and if: 
(a)  The development activity authorized by the permit has commenced prior to the effective date of these regulations or any amendment thereto or have/has commenced after the effective date of these regulations but within six (6) months of issuance of the building permit or development order. 
(b)  If the development permit expires, any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of these regulations or amendment thereto. 
2.  Previously Approved Development Orders: Unexpired development orders issued prior to the adoption of these LDRs or an amendment thereto, where development activity proceeds according to the time limits in the regulations under which the development was originally approved, must meet only the requirements of the regulations in effect when the development order was approved. If the development order expires or is otherwise invalidated, any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of these regulations or amendment thereto. 
3.  Zoning in Progress, Applicability, Temporary Hold on Permits and Licenses. 
(a)  Purpose. The zoning in progress doctrine ("zoning in progress") generally allows the City to apply, on a retroactive basis, if necessary, changes to zoning regulations or to the zoning district status of property, to previously approved but not yet constructed or currently in process development applications. Additionally, the zoning in progress allows a temporary hold on permits and licenses if there is a change in zoning, which is already in progress, that would affect the permit or license. 
(b)  Initial adoption of Land Development Regulations. Zoning in progress shall be applied to the initial adoption of this section in the following manner: 
i.  Zoning in progress shall not be applied to the extent that vested rights are established. 
ii.  Except with respect to impact fees or other exactions, i.e., affordable housing requirements, that may be imposed and for which building permits have not yet issued, zoning in progress shall not be applied to complete and pending applications for development permits which have been filed with the City before the adoption of the Ordinances. 
iii.  Zoning in progress shall apply to applications for development approvals, which were filed with City after the cut-off date established in [Subsection] (b) above. Upon the adoption of any impact fees or exactions, all applicants will be responsible for the remittance and/ or provision or construction of same to the City, irrespective of time of filing of the application, up to and including to the time of issuance of a building permit. 
iv.  Zoning in progress shall not apply to the grant of any moratorium waiver specifically granted by the City Council. 
(c)  Future amendments to Land Development Regulations. When an amendment to the Land Development Regulations or in the application of any particular zoning district classification to land is being considered, the City may impose a temporary hold on any development applications pending before the City with respect to the area or the zoning regulatory text which is the subject of the amendment. The hold shall commence upon the date that notice of zoning in progress is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and shall continue in effect for a period from the date of notice until the subject change, with or without amendments, shall have been approved or disapproved by the City Council or for a period of three (3) months, whichever is sooner, unless such development application would be in conformity with the more restrictive of the existing zoning district status or the zoning district regulations as compared to the proposed zoning district status or zoning district regulations. An affected person may appeal the City staff's application of this provision to the City Council for review by the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Manager. 
(Ord. No. 2014-21 , § 2, 1-13-2015) 
Section 100.05. - Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. 
    The LDRs incorporate the requirements and regulations to implement the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, and to ensure that all land development activities within the City are consistent with and further the objectives, policies, land uses, densities and intensities in the City's Comprehensive Plan (the "Plan"). 
    It is recognized, however, that situations may arise in the daily administration and enforcement of the LDRs whereby strict interpretation and enforcement of the Code may be contrary to the goals, objectives and policies of the Plan. Such situations may arise due to changes in land development priorities or economics, new issues which were not anticipated at the time the LDRs were drafted and adopted, or the inability to meet competing goals through a single action. In these situations, the goals and policies of the Plan shall take precedence, and the LDRs shall be interpreted and administered consistent with the overall goals, objectives and policies of the Plan as interpreted by the City Council, until such time that the LDRs and/or Plan can be amended to resolve any conflict. 
Section 100.06. - Interpretation and Administration. 
    In the interpretation and administration of the LDRs, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Generally: In the interpretation and application of the LDRs all provisions shall be liberally construed in favor of the objectives and purposes of the City and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State Statutes. 
B.  Responsibility: In the event that any question arises concerning the application of regulations, performance standards, definitions, development criteria, or any other provision of the LDRs, the Director shall be responsible for interpretation and shall look to the Plan for guidance. Responsibility for interpretation by the Director shall be limited to standards, regulations and requirements of the LDRs, but shall not be construed to include interpretation of any technical codes adopted by reference in the LDRs, and shall not be construed as overriding the responsibilities given to any commission, board or official named in other sections or Articles of the LDRs. 
C.  Delegation of Authority: Unless otherwise specified in the LDRs, the identification of certain officials, including the City Manager, Planning Director, City Attorney or any other Department Director or City Official to perform a task or carry out a specific responsibility, shall also include the designee of such official. Unless otherwise specified in the LDR, the term "Director" shall mean the Planning Director and the term "Department" shall mean the Planning Department. 
D.  Computation of Time: This is the time within which an act is to be done and shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the last day shall be the following first full workday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed shall be less than seven (7) days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. A half-holiday shall be considered as any other day and not as a holiday. 
E.  Gender: Words importing the masculine gender shall be construed to include the feminine and neuter. 
F.  Number: Words in the singular shall include the plural and words in the plural shall include the singular. 
G.  Shall, May: The word "shall" is mandatory; "may" is permissive.

Section 100.08. - Conflicting Language or Provisions. 
    Wherever any requirement of the LDRs conflicts with the requirements of any other regulation or ordinance, the most restrictive requirement, or that imposing the higher standards shall govern, unless otherwise specifically provided. 
Section 100.09. - Other Regulatory Authority. 
    The issuance of a permit or approval by a federal or state agency, water management district, or other governing body shall not obligate City of Marathon to grant approval, and shall not be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the LDRs. 
    Where applicable, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 380, the Department of Community Affairs has appeal authority over actions taken by the City. 
Section 100.10. - Deed Restrictions. 
    The enforcement and interpretation of the LDRs shall not be affected by deed restrictions, covenants or easements, other than those made as a condition of approval of a development application under the LDRs or any predecessor ordinance. 
Section 100.11. - Severability. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City Council that if any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Ordinance but they shall remain in effect.

2.  The resultant two (2) lots shall: 
a.  Meet the minimum requirements of the City Comprehensive Plan and the LDRs. 
b.  Each be memorialized with a survey showing at a minimum, the parent parcel and the resultant individual parcel each survey of which shall be recorded in the public record. 
c.  Each be memorialized with a document recorded in the public record, which shall include the following disclosure statement: 
"The parcel of land described in this instrument is located in the City of Marathon. The use of the parcel of land is subject to and restricted by the goals, policies and objectives of the Plan and land development regulations adopted as a part of, and in conjunction with and as a means of implementing the Plan. The Land Development Regulations provide that no building permit shall be issued for any development of any kind unless the proposed development complies with each and every requirement of the regulations, including minimum area requirements for residential development. You are hereby notified that under the City Land Development Regulations, the division of land into parcels of land which are not approved as platted lots under these regulations confer no right to develop a parcel of land for any purpose. You are further notified that the platting of land confers no rights to a building permit allocation under the Building Permit Allocations System (BPAS). The platting of land is not recognition of the right to a BPAS allocation which is predicated on availability and the Florida Keys hurricane evacuation model clearance time" 
3.  Any further division of a legal lot of record shall be deemed a subdivision and shall comply with this article and these regulations. 
4.  Reconfigured lots must be unified through a Unity of Title or a declaration of restrictions and covenants in a form approved by the City Attorney. 
F.  Subdivision of Duplex Lots. 
1.  A parcel containing a duplex structure may be subdivided into two (2) parcels subdividing said duplex structure pursuant to Policy 1-3.1.2 of the City's Comprehensive Plan and requirements of the LDRs provided that: 
a.  Each of the parcels thus divided is memorialized with a survey showing at a minimum, the parent parcel and the resultant individual parcel each survey of which shall be recorded in the public record; and 
b.  A Joint Maintenance Agreement, as approved by the City Attorney, of the duplex structure shall be recorded in the Public Records of Monroe County by the individual lot owners. 
G.  Reconfiguration of Lots. From one (1) to three (3) adjacent parcels may be reconfigured; provided, however, that the sale, exchange or reconfiguration of lots to or between adjoining property owners of the re-subdivided lots meet all of the following: 
1.  Does not create additional lots or the potential for additional density or intensity; 
2.  Does not alter rights-of-way or other areas dedicated for public use; 
3.  The new lots and any residual land meets the requirements of the City's Plan and LDRs; 
4.  Reconfigured lots must be unified through a Unity of Title or a declaration of restrictions and covenants in a form approved by the City Attorney. 
5.  Reconfiguration does not convey any additional right to clear native vegetation beyond those limits established in the LDRs or as may have been established by conservation easement. 
(Ord. No. 2017-02 , § 3, 2-28-2017) 
Section 102.47. - Minor and Major Subdivision. 
A.  Application Requirements. The submittal requirements and review procedure for all minor and major subdivision development plans shall be in accordance with Chapter 102 and shall provide the following minimal information: 
    The preliminary subdivision plan for both a minor or major subdivision (and plat) shall be submitted on black or blue line prints drawn at an acceptable scale such as 50 feet to the inch on sheets no larger than 34 by 44 inches. The principle difference between a Minor and Major Subdivision lies in whether the subdivision proposes the approval of new streets which may ultimately be dedicated to the City of Marathon (or remain as private streets). The plan drawing shall include the following: 
1.  All materials required under Section 102.01 "Application Forms", except as modified by specific requirements below. 
2.  A boundary survey of the lands to be subdivided and platted. However, a new boundary survey for a re-plat is required only when the re-plat affects any boundary of the previously platted property or when improvements which may affect the boundary of the previously platted property have been made on the lands to be re-platted. The boundary survey must be performed and prepared under the responsible direction and supervision of a professional surveyor and mapper preceding the initial submittal of the plat to the City. This subsection does not restrict a legal entity from employing one (1) professional surveyor and mapper to perform and prepare the boundary survey and another professional surveyor and mapper to prepare the plat. 
a.  Every plat offered for recording pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be prepared by a professional surveyor and mapper. The plat must be signed and sealed by that professional surveyor and mapper, who must state on the plat that the plat was prepared under his or her direction and supervision and that the plat complies with all of the survey requirements of this part. Every plat must also contain the printed name and registration number of the professional surveyor and mapper directly below the statement required by this section, along with the printed name, address, and certificate of authorization number of the legal entity, if any. A professional surveyor and mapper practicing independently of a legal entity must include his or her address. 
3.  A title opinion of an attorney at law licensed in Florida or a certification by an abstractor or a title company showing that record title to the land as described and shown in the proposed subdivision and subsequent plat or re-plat is in the name of the person, persons, corporation, or executing the dedication. The title opinion or certification shall also show all mortgages not satisfied or released of record nor otherwise terminated by law. 
4.  The title under which the subdivision is to be recorded, the names of the developer, the engineer, the surveyor, architect and land planner, the tax parcel number(s) and Section, Township, and Range. 
a.  Every subdivision shall be given a name by which it shall be legally known. For the purpose of this section, that name is the "primary name." The primary name shall not be the same or in any way so similar to any name appearing on any recorded plat in the same county as to confuse the records or to mislead the public as to the identity of the subdivision, except when the subdivision is further divided as an additional unit or section by the same developer or the developer's successors in title. In that case, the additional unit, section, or phase shall be given the primary name followed by the unit, section, or phase number. Words such as "the," "re-plat," or "a" may not be used as the first word of the primary name. Every subdivision's name shall have legible lettering of the same size and type, including the words "section," "unit," or "phase." If the word "re-plat" is not part of the primary name, then it may be of a different size and type. The primary name of the subdivision shall be shown in the dedication and shall coincide exactly with the subdivision name. 
b.  Any change in a plat, except as provided in Section 177.141, shall be labeled a "re-plat," and a re-plat must conform with this part. After the effective date of this act, the terms "amended plat," "revised plat," "corrected plat," and "re-subdivision" may not be used to describe the process by which a plat is changed. 
5.  A location map to show the relationship of the proposed development to existing community facilities, developments and streets. 
6.  North point, scale and date. 
7.  The location of present property and section lines, boundaries of incorporated areas, land description, existing streets and/or driveways within 150 feet of the property boundaries, buildings, wetlands, and other natural resources. 
8.  Existing utilities, including sanitary sewer, water, stormwater, electricity lines, telephone, gas, cable television, etc., within the parcel and immediately adjacent to it. 
9.  Contours of the land at one-foot intervals. Contours shall be based on National Geodetic Vertical Datum 1929 or later. 
10.  Subsurface conditions of the parcel. 
11.  Approximate location of the 100-year floodplain and data used to establish its location. 
12.  The names and boundaries of all adjoining subdivisions. The names of record owners and City tax parcel numbers of all adjoining parcels of un-subdivided land. Adjoining land uses, in accordance with the City of Marathon Future Land Use Map shall also be shown. 
13.  A statement of utility plan indicating types and provider of services. 
14.  The location of all existing lots must be shown. Proposed lot lines and areas must be shown as well and meet the standards set out in Table 102.46.1. 
a.  Actual subdivided and platted lot areas may be less than the minimum lot area shown above, if, the density of the total subdivided area does not exceed the per acre densities allowed in Table 103.15.2, "Density, Intensity, and Dimensions for Zoning Districts," for each Land Use District. Streets, internal park and open space areas, recreation space, protected habitat areas requiring conservation easements may all be the basis for such reductions in the platted lot area if they are included in the overall density calculations for the subdivision and subsequent plat. Such reductions shall be noted in the plat and a complete accounting of acreage respective of allowed densities shall be made in the plat document. Equally, if lot area reductions are allowed as part of the subdivision and platting process, the plat documents shall clearly indicate that no future subdivision shall be allowed of any area accounted for in density calculations. 
b.  An applicant who wishes to subdivide property may obtain a reduction in the minimum street-front lot width based on a strict mathematical averaging of the actual street-front lot width of all properties within 500 feet of the property being subdivided on the same street and within 250 feet on parallel streets. The distances noted (e.g., 500 feet and 250 feet) are flexible based on the actual location on the street of the property subject to subdivision and the meander of that street. The reduction allowed will be the cumulative average of street-front lot widths rounded up to the nearest ten-foot increment (e.g., average = 76.5 feet; allowed street front lot width = 80 feet). In no case shall the resultant street frontage lot width be less than 30 feet. 
15.  The general location of all native trees, natural plant communities, and protected species habitat pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 2, "Trees and Native Vegetation," Article 3, "Natural Plant and Wildlife Habitat," and Article 4, "Open Water, Surface Water, and Wetlands." 
16.  A preliminary description of any required Conservation Management Areas pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 8, "Conservation Management Areas" including any required management plans pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 9, " Management Plans" as established in the LDRs. 
17.  The general location of all required landscape material pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 107, Article 8, "Landscaping" of the LDRs. 
18.  The street layout of all new streets, if applicable, including provision of supporting traffic study. The traffic study shall meet the requirements of Chapter 107 Article 13, "Concurrency Management." 
19.  Lot and proposed driveway placement shall be pursuant to Chapter 107, Article 14, "Access Management", shall meet all of the requirements of Chapter 106, Articles 2 and 3 concerning the preservation of Class I, II and III habitats. Lots shall avoid entirely if possible all Class I and II habitats which would otherwise be conserved in a conservation easement pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 8. Proposed driveway alignments shall avoid regulated trees and native vegetation in Class III habitats pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 2. Consideration shall be given to combining or shifting proposed driveway locations in meeting the provisions of this subsection and of the sections of the LDRs referenced herein. 
20.  The proposed layout of all utilities including potable water (including required fire hydrants), electric, sewer, and cable, particularly in the instance that the subdivision and subsequent plat propose new streets. 
a.  As established for Major Subdivisions and subsequent plats, for which new streets are proposed, all utilities shall be designed, approved by the relevant authorizing authority, and satisfactorily constructed by the subdivision applicant prior to acceptance of the streets by the City. 
21.  A conceptual stormwater management plan that contains the outlines and general location of proposed drainage areas consistent with Chapter 107 Article 11, "Stormwater Management". This stormwater management plan will vary in complexity dependent upon whether the subdivision and subsequent plat propose new streets that would ultimately be dedicated to the City of Marathon. 
B.  Notice. Notice for required public meetings shall be in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 102, Article 4, "Notice of Public Meetings and Hearings." In particular, published, mailed, and posted notice is required pursuant to the requirements for both a subdivision and Conditional Use Permit process. 
C.  Concept Meeting. The Developer is required to schedule and attend a concept meeting with the Department and present a general plan for the subdivision, including a lot layout, to receive advice and guidance prior to proceeding with engineering plans and plat preparation, if required. 
D.  Preliminary Review and Approval. 
1.  The purpose of this stage is for the Developer to schedule and present a subdivision plan, which has progressed to preliminary stage, to the TRC to receive advice, guidance and approval prior to proceeding with final engineering plans and plat preparation. All preliminary plan submittals shall meet the requirements of Chapter 102, Article 9, "Site Plan Review", and all plat submittals shall meet the requirements of Section 102.47 E.5. below. 
2.  Pursuant to Chapter 107, Article 13 of the LDRs, no preliminary subdivision plan shall be approved unless a determination can be made that all public facilities will be adequate to support and service the area of the subdivision. The applicant shall submit sufficient information and data as part of the subdivision plan to demonstrate the necessary public services are adequate to address the impact created by the subdivision and to demonstrate that the proposed subdivision is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
3.  At the time of preliminary submittal, all proposed new streets, if any, shall be staked at their centerlines and marked at appropriate stationing at approximately 1,000 foot intervals. 
4.  Upon the date of completion of the Preliminary Review and Approval by the TRC, a letter shall be drafted within 30 days identifying all elements of the plan which are either accepted or are deficient. All areas of deficiency shall be clearly delineated with a concise explanation of the deficiency. 
E.  Final Subdivision Review. The purpose of this stage is for the Developer to present the final development plan to the Planning Commission and City Council for review. At this stage the subdivision plans and plat shall be consistent with the approved Preliminary Plan with any revisions requested by the TRC and shall be in final form. Thus, no final subdivision shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission and City Council without the prior review of the TRC such that all recommended changes have been made to the preliminary subdivision documents. Two (2) copies of the final engineering plans, supporting calculations and plat, if applicable, shall be submitted to the City at the same scale and size as the preliminary plans. Said documents shall be sufficient to serve as construction documents which would be permitted by the City. The City will review the plans and return one (1) set appropriately marked noting any deficiencies to the Developer's Engineer within 30 working days. After final approval by the Council, the City will issue a letter stating that the subdivision has been approved and that the plat has been approved for recordation. This submittal shall include: 
1.  A complete stormwater management plan including all information required in Chapter 107, Article 11, "Stormwater Management". In addition, all plans shall contain the outlines and sizes in acres of drainage areas at the various points of concentration along the new street system. Stormwater management for individual approved lots or groups of lots shall identify stormwater management areas and structures (actual structures, berms, or swales), in compliance with the article. Any stormwater management area that qualifies for use as required open space per Chapter 107, Article 9, "Open Space", shall be clearly delineated on the plan and plat. Detailed engineering construction plans shall be provided as prepared, signed and sealed by a Florida registered engineer, including plan/profiles at horizontal scale of not more than 50 feet to the inch and at a vertical scale of not less than one-tenth (1/10) of the horizontal scale, and cross-sections at appropriate horizontal and vertical scales, on sheets no larger than 34 by 44 inches. Engineering plans shall include all roads, streets, fire hydrants, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, stormwater management facilities, erosion and sedimentation control measures, construction notes, and benchmarks. Such plans should be suitable to be utilized as construction drawings to be utilized in the approval of subdivision construction permits. 
2.  The final location of all regulated native trees and identified in Chapter 106, Article 2 and a plan approved by the City biologist for the relocation, replacement, or mitigation of all regulated trees which would be removed or relocated as a result of the installation of required streets or utilities. Otherwise, prior to development of each lot, such regulated native trees shall remain intact and in place. 
3.  The final identification of natural plant and wildlife habitat or open water, surface water, or wetlands which shall be identified in the subdivision and subsequent plat as a Conservation Management Area, such management area to be managed through a management plan. The plat shall include a conservation easement for the Conservation Management Area to be assumed in perpetuity and shall be recorded as part of the plat. 
4.  The specific location, identified in the subdivision and plat as a landscape easement, for all required landscape areas pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 107, Article 8, "Landscaping" of the LDRs. 
5.  Every plat of a subdivision offered for recording shall conform to the following: 
a.  It must be: 
i.  An original drawing made with black permanent drawing ink; or 
ii.  A nonadhered scaled print on a stable base film made by photographic processes from a film scribing tested for residual hypo testing solution to assure permanency. 
Marginal lines, standard certificates and approval forms shall be printed on the plat with a permanent black drawing ink. A print or photographic copy of the original drawing must be submitted with the original drawing. 
b.  The size of each sheet shall not exceed 34 by 44 inches and shall be drawn with a marginal line around each sheet and placed so as to leave at least a one-half-inch margin on each of three (3) sides and a three-inch margin on the left side of the plat for binding purposes. 
c.  When more than one (1) sheet must be used to accurately portray the lands subdivided, an index or key map must be included and each sheet must show the particular number of that sheet and the total number of sheets included, as well as clearly labeled matchlines to show where other sheets match or adjoin. 
d.  In all cases, the letter size and scale used shall be of sufficient size to show all detail. The scale shall be both stated and graphically illustrated by a graphic scale drawn on every sheet showing any portion of the lands subdivided. 
e.  The name of the plat shall be shown in bold legible letters, as stated in Section 177.051. The name of the subdivision shall be shown on each sheet included. The name of the professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity, along with the street and mailing address, must be shown on each sheet included. 
f.  A prominent "north arrow" shall be drawn on every sheet included showing any portion of the lands subdivided. The bearing or azimuth reference shall be clearly stated on the face of the plat in the notes or legend, and, in all cases, the bearings used shall be referenced to some well-established and monumented line. 
g.  Permanent reference monuments must be placed at each corner or change in direction on the boundary of the lands being platted and may not be more than 1,400 feet apart. Where such corners are in an inaccessible place, "P.R.M.s" shall be set on a nearby offset within the boundary of the plat and such offset shall be so noted on the plat. Where corners are found to coincide with a previously set "P.R.M.," the Florida registration number of the professional surveyor and mapper in responsible charge or the certificate of authorization number of the legal entity on the previously set "P.R.M." shall be shown on the new plat or, if unnumbered, shall so state. Permanent reference monuments shall be set before the recording of the plat. The "P.R.M.s" shall be shown on the plat by an appropriate symbol or designation. 
h.  Permanent control points shall be set on the centerline of the right-of-way at the intersection and terminus of all streets, at each change of direction, and no more than 1,000 feet apart. Such "P.C.P.s" shall be shown on the plat by an appropriate symbol or designation. In those counties or municipalities that do not require subdivision improvements and do not accept bonds or escrow accounts to construct improvements, "P.C.P.s" may be set prior to the recording of the plat and must be set within one (1) year of the date the plat was recorded. In the counties or municipalities that require subdivision improvements and have the means of insuring the construction of said improvements, such as bonding requirements, "P.C.P.s" must be set prior to the expiration of the bond or other surety. If the professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity of record is no longer in practice or is not available due to relocation, or when the contractual relationship between the subdivider and professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity has been terminated, the subdivider shall contract with a professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity in good standing to place the "P.C.P.s" within the time allotted. 
i.  Monuments shall be set at all lot corners, points of intersection, and changes of direction of lines within the subdivision which do not require a "P.R.M." or a "P.C.P."; however, a monument need not be set if a monument already exists at such corner, point, or change of direction or when a monument cannot be set due to a physical obstruction. In those counties or municipalities that do not require subdivision improvements and do not accept bonds or escrow accounts to construct improvements, monuments may be set prior to the recording of the plat and must be set at the lot corners before the transfer of the lot. In those counties or municipalities that require subdivision improvements and have the means of ensuring the construction of those improvements, such as bonding requirements, monuments shall be set prior to the expiration of the bond or other surety. If the professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity of record is no longer in practice or is not available due to relocation, or when the contractual relationship between the subdivider and professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity has been terminated, the subdivider shall contract with a professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity in good standing who shall be allowed to place the monuments within the time allotted. 
j.  The section, township, and range shall appear immediately under the name of the plat on each sheet included, along with the name of the city and state in which the land being platted is situated. 
k.  Each plat shall show a description of the lands subdivided, and the description shall be the same in the title certification. The description must be so complete that from it, without reference to the plat, the starting point and boundary can be determined. 
l.  The dedications and approvals required by Sections 177.071 and 177.081 must be shown. 
m.  The Monroe County Clerk's certificate and the professional surveyor and mapper's seal and statement required by Section 177.061 shall be shown. 
n.  All section lines and quarter section lines occurring within the subdivision shall be indicated by lines drawn upon the map or plat, with appropriate words and figures. If the description is by metes and bounds, all information called for, such as the point of commencement, course bearings and distances, and the point of beginning, shall be indicated. If the platted lands are in a land grant or are not included in the subdivision of government surveys, then the boundaries are to be defined by metes and bounds and courses. 
o.  Location, width, and names of all streets, waterways, or other rights-of-way shall be shown, as applicable. 
p.  Location and width of proposed easements and existing easements identified in the title opinion or certification required by Subsection 177.041(2) shall be shown on the plat or in the notes or legend, and their intended use shall be clearly stated. Where easements are not coincident with property lines, they must be labeled with bearings and distances and tied to the principal lot, tract, or right-of-way. 
q.  All contiguous properties shall be identified by subdivision title, plat book, and page, or, if unplatted, land shall be so designated. If the subdivision platted is a part or the whole of a previously recorded subdivision, sufficient ties shall be shown to controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an overlay to be made; the fact of its being a re-plat shall be stated as a subtitle under the name of the plat on each sheet included. The subtitle must state the name of the subdivision being re-platted and the appropriate recording reference. 
r.  All lots shall be numbered either by progressive numbers or, if in blocks, progressively numbered in each block, and the blocks progressively numbered or lettered, except that blocks in numbered additions bearing the same name may be numbered consecutively throughout the several additions. 
s.  Sufficient survey data shall be shown to positively describe the bounds of every lot, block, street easement, and all other areas shown on the plat. When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an irregular line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a witness line showing complete data, with distances along all lines extended beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty as can be determined or as "more or less," if variable. Lot, block, street, and all other dimensions except to irregular boundaries, shall be shown to a minimum of hundredths of feet. All measurements shall refer to horizontal plane and in accordance with the definition of the U.S. Survey foot or meter adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. All measurements shall use the 39.37/12=3.28083333333 equation for conversion from a U.S. foot to meters. 
t.  Curvilinear lot lines shall show the radii, arc distances, and central angles. Radial lines will be so designated. Direction of nonradial lines shall be indicated. 
u.  Sufficient angles, bearings, or azimuth to show direction of all lines shall be shown, and all bearings, angles, or azimuth shall be shown to the nearest second of arc. 
v.  The centerlines of all streets shall be shown as follows: 
Noncurved lines: distances together with either angles, bearings, or azimuths; 
Curved lines: arc distances, central angles, and radii, together with cord and cord bearing or azimuths. 
w.  Park and recreation parcels as applicable shall be so designated. 
x.  All interior excepted parcels as described in the description of the lands being subdivided shall be clearly indicated and labeled "Not a part of this plat." 
y.  The purpose of all areas dedicated must be clearly indicated or stated on the plat. 
z.  When it is not possible to show line or curve data information on the map, a tabular form may be used. The tabular data must appear on the sheet to which it applies. 
aa.  The plat shall include in a prominent place the following statements: "NOTICE: This plat, as recorded in its graphic form, is the official depiction of the subdivided lands described herein and will in no circumstances be supplanted in authority by any other graphic or digital form of the plat. There may be additional restrictions that are not recorded on this plat that may be found in the public records of this county." 
bb.  All platted utility easements shall provide that such easements shall also be easements for the construction, installation, maintenance, and operation of cable television services; provided, however, no such construction, installation, maintenance, and operation of cable television services shall interfere with the facilities and services of an electric, telephone, gas, or other public utility. In the event a cable television company damages the facilities of a public utility, it shall be solely responsible for the damages. This section shall not apply to those private easements granted to or obtained by a particular electric, telephone, gas, or other public utility. Such construction, installation, maintenance, and operation shall comply with the National Electrical Safety Code as adopted by the Florida Public Service Commission. 
cc.  A legend of all symbols and abbreviations shall be shown.

Section 102.48. - Minor Subdivision Improvement Requirements. 
A.  As defined in Chapter 110, Article 3, a Minor Subdivision is one in which the requested subdivision does not include any new streets within the City such that all resultant lots shall have access from existing public or private streets within the City of Marathon. 
B.  For each lot created as part of the approved minor subdivision (minus any system development charges previously assessed), all system development charges shall be paid at or before final subdivision and plat approval. Such assessment of charges shall be completed in accordance with Chapter 34 of the City's Code of Ordinances and particularly Article 6 of the Chapter. Said charges are associated with the direct costs of the City's existing utility and any necessary improvements therein. 
C.  As a Minor Subdivision involves no construction of new public streets, all utility construction will occur within existing City Rights-of-Way or private roads. 
a.  All utility and right-of-way permits shall be obtained and issued prior to final plat approval for: 
i.  Wastewater utility installation; 
ii.  Electric utility pole and transformer installation (if any); 
iii.  Potable water utility extensions; 
iv.  Addition of any required fire hydrants;

Section 102.49. - Major Subdivision Improvement Requirements. 
A.  As defined in Chapter 110, Article 3, a Major Subdivision is one in which the requested subdivision of land includes the approval and required construction of new streets which connect to existing public and/or private streets within the City. Over and above the provision of subdivision documents and a plat, the ultimate approval of a major subdivision also involves the construction of infrastructure improvements including stormwater, wastewater, potable water, fire hydrants, and electric utility elements and the overlying streets. Since such improvements will require time and considerable expense to construct, construction guarantees shall be required. 
B.  For each lot created as part of the approved major subdivision, the City shall provide a letter outlining all required system development charges. System development charges shall be paid at or before final subdivision and plat approval. Such assessment of charges shall be completed in accordance with Chapter 34 of the City's Code of Ordinances and particularly Article 6 of the Chapter. Said charges are associated with the direct costs of the City's existing utility and any necessary improvements therein. Said system development charges are not payment for required internal utility construction as part of the approved subdivision and plat. 
C.  All construction of required streets and utilities shall be completed pursuant to this Section. Construction Guarantees shall be required pursuant to Sections 102.50 and 102.51 and shall provide that if the construction of the required improvements is not completed within two (2) years after approval of the final plat, the City may deem the applicant to be in default pursuant to Section 102.52 D. 
D.  Standards for street construction and drainage improvements are hereby established as the FDOT, Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Streets and Highways (the "Florida Greenbook") May 2013 Edition or as revised. Standard Right-of-Way dimensions, typically 50 feet, and cross-sectional standards are available through the City Public Works Department. Further, design standards for City Utilities and the location of available wastewater utilities may be obtained through the City Utilities Department. 
E.  Procedure for Acceptance by the City. 
1.  The City will review and approve engineering design plans and construction documents for all streets and utility elements approved as part of an approved subdivision and plat or re-plat. The subdivision developer will be responsible for obtaining approvals, permits, inspections, and sign-offs for all other utilities independently. 
2.  Once approved, the subdivision applicant shall be responsible for making all necessary street, utilities, and drainage improvements within the boundaries of the plat. 
a.  Such improvements will be inspected and certified by the design engineer and all improvements with respect to the street, right-of-way, wastewater utilities and stormwater utilities shall be warranted for a period of two (2) years in favor of the City. 
b.  The subdivision developer shall provide all other utility sign-offs and certifications to the City. 
c.  The City may elect to complete its own inspections on the street and its utilities pursuant to its approvals, permits, and design standards. 
3.  Once all inspections and certifications are approved by the City, the City will accept ownership of all rights-of-way, streets and utilities within its control that lie within the boundaries of the subdivision and plat.

Section 102.51. - Forms of Guarantee. 
    One (1) of the following forms of guarantee shall be submitted to the Council as part of the application for final plat review: 
A.  Cash Escrow. The developer shall establish an escrow account in a form approved by the City attorney in the amount required. 
1.  The account shall be established in a federally insured financial institution (escrowee). The escrowee shall administer the account in accordance with the provision of the escrow agreement between the Council and the applicant. The agreement shall contain provisions for specific application of the funds, contract payouts, contract retention percentages until complete; proration of reduction of deposit excess; final escrow settlement; and other pertinent administrative matters as may be required. 
2.  The escrowee shall disburse funds from time to time as ordered by the owner's engineer and approved by the City. The owner or escrowee may not approve disbursements. The City shall supply the owner a copy of the engineer's estimate for payment at the time of approval by the City. Each payout order shall be accompanied by all appropriate sworn statements, affidavits and supporting waivers of lien in full compliance with Florida law. 
3.  If the City determines that the balance of funds then remaining undisbursed is more than sufficient to cover the cost of the construction and maintenance fees, the City shall request the escrowee to pay to the owner any excess of funds. The request shall be in writing and include the reduced balance to be maintained in the account. 
B.  Letter of Credit. The applicant may file a straight commercial letter of credit from any financial institution acceptable to the Council in a form acceptable to the City attorney. The letter of credit must provide the following:

2.  That its amount will be reduced from time to time as payments approved by the City are made. 
3.  A statement of irrevocability for a minimum of 36 months from the date of final plat approval. 
4.  That if any balance remains at the expiration of any time limit placed on it, the balance shall be deposited with the City in a cash escrow, a new letter of credit in the unpaid balance amount shall be issued or a surety bond, in accordance with this article, shall be provided. 
5.  That ten (10) percent of the amount shall be retained until the City and the Director have approved the improvements required.

Section 102.52. - Other Guarantee Considerations. 
A.  Time Limit. All guarantees pursuant to either Section 102.48 or 102.49, shall provide that if the construction of the required improvements is not completed after approval of the final plat, the City may deem the applicant to be in default pursuant to Section 102.52 D. 
B.  Approval Required. The guarantee amount is subject to approval by the Council and City attorney. 
C.  Adjustment. The costs may be reviewed periodically for accuracy and are subject to adjustment upward or downward by the Director based on existing economic conditions at the time of review and on the recommendation of the TRC. 
D.  Default. In the event the Director determines that the owner has failed to install the proposed improvements according to the approved plans and specifications or has failed to comply with the terms of the guarantees, the Director, in consultation with the City attorney may take the following actions: 
1.  Cash Escrow and Letter of Credit. Advise the owner in writing of the failure and providing the owner 30 days to cure the default. If the owner fails to cure the default or present compelling reason why no default should be declared, the Director may recommend to the Council that it declare the owner in default and upon written notification to the escrowee of such declaration of default, deem the balance under the deposit agreement as forfeited to the City, to be then placed in an appropriate trust and agency account subject to the order of the Director for such purposes as letting contracts to bring about the completion of the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans or other appropriate purposes in the interest of the public safety, health, and welfare; or require the developer to submit an additional cash sum or letter of credit sufficient to guarantee the completion of the improvements indicated on the approved improvement plans after recalculation in order to allow for any inflated or increased costs of constructing improvements. 
2.  Surety Bond. Inform the bonding company in writing of the default by the owner and require the surety to perform on the bond and pay to the Department the balance of the bond. 
3.  Failure to Comply. If the developer or surety fails to comply with the Director's requirements above, or if the Director determines that forfeiture of the remaining deposit or surety balance will not allow completion of the required improvements, the Director may suspend the right of anyone to build or construct on the undeveloped portion of the subdivision. For the purpose of this subsection the undeveloped portion of the subdivision means all lots other than lots which have been sold for personal use and occupancy or are under bona fide contract for sale to any person for personal use or occupancy. The Director shall give the developer ten (10) days' written notice of an order under this subsection, with copies to all issuers of letters of credit or sureties, as appropriate, who have outstanding obligations for any undeveloped portion of the subdivision, and shall record an affidavit of such notice in the public records of Monroe County.

All mortgagees having a record interest in the lands subdivided shall execute, in the same manner in which deeds are required to be executed, either the dedication contained on the plat or a separate instrument joining in and ratifying the plat and all dedications and reservations thereon. 
D.  When a tract or parcel of land has been subdivided and a plat thereof bearing the dedication executed by the owners of record and mortgagees having a record interest in the lands subdivided, and when the approval of the City has been secured and recorded in compliance with this part, all streets, alleys, easements, rights-of-way, and public areas shown on such plat, unless otherwise stated, shall be deemed to have been dedicated to the public for the uses and purposes thereon stated. However, nothing herein shall be construed as creating an obligation upon the City to perform any act of construction or maintenance within such dedicated areas except when the obligation is voluntarily assumed by the governing body. 
E.  Approval of a plat shall expire without further action of the PC or Council unless the plat has been recorded within one (1) year of the date of Council approval of the plat.

Appeals Review Process 

ARTICLE 18. - BENEFICIAL USE DETERMINATIONS 

Section 102.99. - Purpose and Intent. 
A.  If a landowner in the City has applied for and been denied a development permit and is of the opinion all beneficial use of the landowner's property has been denied by applying the LDRs, the procedures listed in this section shall be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of beneficial use of property may be remedied through a nonjudicial forum. 
B.  The beneficial use determination is a process by which the City evaluates the allegation that no beneficial use remains and can provide relief from the regulations by granting additional development potential, providing just compensation or if it so determines, extending a purchase offer for the property. However, this article also intends that such relief not increase the potential for damages to health, safety, or welfare of future users of the property or neighbors that might reasonably be anticipated if the landowner were permitted to build. 
Section 102.100. - Application Written Recommendation by Department and City Attorney. 
A.  Application: The nature of this appeal, that this chapter denies the landowner all beneficial use of the property, requires, among other things, detailed financial information on the property not typically required or desired in normal applications. All applications for beneficial use determinations shall be submitted to the Department in accordance with Article 2, "Common Development Application Elements", of this chapter, and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
1.  A description of the specific portions of the LDRs which allegedly eliminate all beneficial use of the property, together with all appraisals, studies, any other supporting evidence, and any actions taken by the City related to the property. Such supporting evidence may include documentation that the property has been listed for sale for at least six (6) months after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and originals or copies of all bids, offers to purchase, and other correspondence regarding the sale of such property. 
2.  All factual information and knowledge reasonably available to the owner to address the deprivation standards set forth below in Section 102.102 "Deprivation Criteria". 
3.  Documentation of the purchase date and price of the property. 
4.  A description of the property's physical features, total acreage, and present use, as well as the use of the property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
5.  A description of the use which the landowner believes represents the property's minimum beneficial use and all documentation, studies, and other evidence supporting that position. 
B.  Review by Planning Department and City Attorney: Not later than 45 working days after receipt of a complete application, the Department and the City attorney shall review the application for compliance with the deprivation standards of this section, and applicable law and shall make a written recommendation to the Hearing Officer. 
Section 102.101. - Review and Recommendation by Hearing Officer. 
A.  The applicant will be afforded on a timely basis, a quasi-judicial, evidentiary hearing before the Hearing Officer. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the City to the applicant at least 15 working days prior to the scheduled hearing. The parties before the Hearing Officer shall be the City and the applicant. Testimony and evidence shall be limited to the matters directly relating to the deprivation standards and relief criteria of Sections 102.102 and 102.103, respectively. 
B.  Not later than 60 working days after the closing of the quasi-judicial, evidentiary hearing under Subsection A. of this section, the Hearing Officer shall issue a recommendation regarding the application. The recommendation shall be in writing and shall include all findings of fact and conclusions for warranting the recommendation, and, if applicable, recommendations as to remedy. 
Section 102.102. - Deprivation Criteria. 
    In determining if a landowner has been deprived of beneficial use of property under this chapter, the Hearing Officer and the Council shall take into account the following factors: 
A.  Whether the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the beneficial use application substantially advances a legitimate government interest. 
B.  Whether the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the beneficial use application denies all reasonable economic use of the property. 
C.  Relevant parcel. If an applicant owns more than one (1) platted lot, a question may exist as to whether more than one (1) of applicant's platted lots should be considered as one parcel for the beneficial use determination. In determining the relevant parcel, the Hearing Officer should focus on "the parcel as a whole" and not on particular segments or portions of the parcel. The Hearing Officer shall consider three (3) factors to determine whether individual platted lots should be combined and considered as one parcel for the purpose of the beneficial use determination: 
1.  The "physical continuity" of the lots or parcels; 
2.  The "unity of ownership" of the lots or parcels (i.e. does the applicant own all of the lots or parcels in question); and 
3.  The "unity of use" between the lots or parcels, i.e., platted urban lots should generally be considered as separate uses, but can be combined for purposes of a beneficial use determination if the lots are part of a larger parcel. For platted lots, this determination should be based on an analysis of the following factors established by the Florida Supreme Court, which must be applied to the particular facts and circumstances on a case-by-case basis: 
(a)  Was it the intent of the landowner to use the lot as a single use? 
(b)  What is the adaptability of the property to be used as a single or separate use versus a combined use? 
(c)  Whether the lots are dependent on each other for the ability to have a single use? 
(d)  Whether unity of the lots is the highest, best use of the parcel? 
(e)  What is the current zoning of each tract? 
(f)  What is the physical size and appearance of the land and what uses exist on surrounding land (for example what types of structures presently exist on the lot(s) and surrounding parcels)? 
(g)  What is the actual use of the land?; and 
(h)  What is the possibility of the lots being combined in use in the reasonably near future? 
D.  Once the relevant parcel is determined, the Hearing Officer must analyze: 
1.  The economic impact of the regulation on the applicant; and 
2.  The extent to which the regulation has interfered with the applicant's investment-backed expectations, including any relevant factors such as: 
(a)  The history of the property (i.e., When was it purchased?, How much land was purchased?, Where was the land located?, What was the nature of title?, What was the composition of the land and how was it initially used?); 
(b)  The history of the development of the property (i.e., What was built on the property and by whom?, How was it subdivided and to whom and at what price was it sold?, What plats were filed?, What infrastructure is in place?); 
(c)  The history of zoning and regulation (i.e., How and when was the land classified? How was the use proscribed? What changes in classifications occurred?); 
(d)  How development changed when title was passed? 
(e)  What is the present nature and extent of the property? 
(f)  What were the reasonable expectations of the landowner under state common law? 
(g)  What were the reasonable expectations of the neighboring landowners under state common law? 
(h)  What was the diminution in the investment-backed expectations of the landowner, if any, after passage of the regulation?; and 
(i)  What was the appraised fair market value immediately before and immediately after the effective date of the regulation? 
Section 102.103. - Granting Relief. 
A.  Recommendation: If the finding made under this subdivision is that a landowner has been denied all reasonable economic use of the property, and only if all reasonable economic use of the property has been denied, the Hearing Officer shall recommend relief be granted. The remedies available to an applicant for beneficial use will include issuance of a permit or just compensation by purchase of all or some of the lots or parcels or purchase of the development rights (leaving the lot in private ownership) at the fair market value immediately prior to the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the beneficial use application, or any other relief the City determines appropriate and adequate to prevent a taking. The Hearing Officer may also find that there has been no taking. 
B.  Minimum Increase: In granting relief, the landowner may be given the minimum increase in use intensity or other possible concessions from this chapter to permit a beneficial use of the land. The highest use is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy, but shall be limited to the minimum economic use of the property necessary to avoid a taking within a reasonable period of time as established by applicable law. 
Section 102.104. - Final Determination by Council. 
    The Council is the only entity which has final authority to grant or deny beneficial uses subject to appeal by DCA under Chapter 380. In approving, denying or modifying an order from a Hearing Officer granting or denying an applicant beneficial use, the Council will ensure that the Hearing Officer has conducted the evidentiary hearing in a manner that is consistent with this article and the Comprehensive Plan. The Council will approve or reject the Hearing Officer's determination during a public hearing. The public shall be given the opportunity to be heard and make arguments for or against the determination during the Council's public hearing.

Beneficial Use Determinations Process 

ARTICLE 19. - VESTED RIGHTS DETERMINATIONS 

Section 102.105. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for relief, on a case-by-case basis, to persons who claim that the adoption of this chapter has interfered with certain development rights that are assumed vested, with regard to their property prior to the effective date of the Plan from which this chapter derives. 
Section 102.106. - Application. 
    Applications for vested rights shall be filed with the Department within 12 months after the effective date of the LDRs, or the alleged vested right shall be deemed abandoned. Application shall be filed in accordance with Article 2, "Common Development Application Elements", of this chapter, and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
A.  A description of the specific portions of this chapter which allegedly interfere with a vested right to develop the property; and 
B.  All factual information and knowledge reasonably available to the owner to address the evaluation criteria set forth in Section 102.111 "Standards and Criteria for Vested Rights". 
Section 102.107. - Review by Department and City Attorney. 
    Not later than 45 working days after receipt of a complete application, the Department and the City attorney shall review the application for compliance with the evaluation criteria of Section 102.111 "Standards and Criteria for Vested Rights", and shall make a written recommendation to the Hearing Officer. 
Section 102.108. - Review and Determination by Hearing Officer. 
A.  The applicant will be afforded, on a timely basis, a quasi-judicial, evidentiary hearing before the Hearing Officer. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the City to the applicant at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing. The parties before the Hearing Officer shall be the City and the applicant. Testimony and evidence shall be limited to the matters directly relating to the evaluation criteria of Section 102.111. 
B.  No later than 60 working days after the closing of the quasi-judicial, evidentiary hearing under Subsection A. of this section, the Hearing Officer shall issue a determination with respect to the application. The determination shall be in writing and shall include findings of fact for each of the applicable evaluation criteria, conclusions of law for each criterion, a final determination, and, if applicable, recommendations as to remedy. 
C.  In furtherance of those guidelines listed in the Comprehensive Plan, a vested rights determination shall also contain the following: 
1.  Verification that the applicant has met the burden of proof for the items listed in Section 102.111; 
2.  A clear statement of what part of the applicant's development is vested (e.g., density, setbacks, open space requirements); 
3.  A clear statement of which comprehensive plan goals, policies and/or objectives and which land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the application, the applicant is vested from; and 
4.  A clear statement to the applicant that construction must continue in good faith and meet all construction deadlines contained in the City Code or the vested rights determination will expire and any and all rights acquired under the determination will be forfeited. 
D.  The vested rights determination shall be limited to rights acquired prior to adoption of the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application, but after adoption of the 1986 Comprehensive Plan (unless a prior, valid and unexpired vested rights determination was obtained under the 2005 Comprehensive Plan or Code Section 102.103). The vested rights determination shall vest only that development specifically and expressly contemplated by a valid, unexpired "official act" of the City of Marathon. 
Section 102.109. - Appeal to Council. 
A.  Within 30 working days after the issuance of the Hearing Officer's written determination, the City or the applicant may appeal the determination to the Council by filing a written notice of appeal and requisite fee with the City Clerk. 
B.  Not later than 30 working days after receipt of written notice of appeal, the Council shall hold a hearing based solely upon the record of the proceedings before the Hearing Officer. 
Section 102.110. - Final Determination. 
    The Council may adopt, reject or modify the Hearing Officer's determination, subject to appeal by DCA under Fla. Stat. ch. 380. 
Section 102.111. - Standards and Criteria for Vested Rights. 
    In making the proposed determination, the Hearing Officer will consider, in furtherance of the guidelines contained in the Comprehensive Plan, the following criteria: 
A.  The vested rights determination shall be limited to rights acquired prior to adoption of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application and shall vest only that development specifically and expressly contemplated by the valid, unexpired "official act" of the City. 
B.  The applicant shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate that: 
1.  There is a valid, unexpired "official act" (as enumerated below in Subsection B.1.(a)-(d) of the City approving the proposed development that occurred prior to the effective date of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application, i.e., July 7, 2005. To be a "valid" act, the act must have been in compliance with the land development regulations that existed at the time of approval, and the approval must have been issued by an official or commission properly delegated with the authority to issue the approval. Any one of the following may constitute an "official act" of the City for purposes of the vested rights determination: 
(a)  A valid, unexpired building permit issued prior to the effective date of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application, i.e., July 7, 2005; or 
(b)  One (1) or more valid, unexpired permits or approvals issued by the City, except that mere approval of a land use designation, map amendment, zoning designation or rezoning is insufficient to establish vested rights without additional permits or approvals for a specific development project, (i.e., mere zoning cannot be considered an "official act" that can form the basis of a vested rights determination); or 
(c)  A subdivision plat recorded in the official records of the City, which fulfills the criteria set forth in Fla. Stat. § 380.05(18), may be an "official act" except that individual lots within the subdivision must also demonstrate that this applicant acquired a vested right to build on the individual lot by obtaining additional governmental approvals or official acts concerning development on the individual lot prior to adoption of the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application, and an applicant must still demonstrate compliance with [Subsections] B.2.-4. of this section with respect to development on each individual lot; or 
(d)  A valid, unexpired vested rights determination approved pursuant to the 2005 comprehensive plan and land development regulations, this article; and 
2.  This individual, particular applicant: 
(a)  Relied upon the official act in "good faith", (For example, the applicant must not have had notice or knowledge of an imminent or pending change in zoning, allowable uses or density, etc. A change is "imminent" or "pending" if notice of the change was published or there are active and documented efforts to develop and approve the proposed change at the time the property was purchased or expenses were incurred); and 
(b)  Had a reliance that was "reasonable", (For example, an act of purchasing the property, entering into contracts or incurring additional obligations done after the 2005 Comprehensive Plan was pending or became effective does not constitute reasonable reliance). 
3.  This applicant incurred such "substantial obligations and expenditures" that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to require that the development conform with the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application. To meet this requirement the applicant must demonstrate that: 
(a)  Application of the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application would prevent or prohibit the applicant from completing the proposed development. For example, if the applicant could still complete the proposed development under the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application without undue hardship by making mere modifications to the development plan, the applicant cannot demonstrate a vested right and must make the modifications required by the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application; and 
(b)  Substantial changes of position or expenditures incurred prior to the "official act" upon which the vested rights claim is based are undertaken at the applicant's own risk and will not be considered in making a vested rights determination. 
4.  Development of this project has commenced and has continued in good faith without substantial interruption. 
Section 102.112. - Waiver of Time Limits. 
    Any time limits herein may be waived upon receipt by the Department of a written stipulation requesting such waiver and signed by the applicant and the Director.

ARTICLE 20. - VARIANCE 

Section 102.113. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this section is to provide a means of altering the requirements of certain sections of the LDRs in specific instances where the strict application of those requirements would deprive a property of privileges enjoyed by other properties with the identical regulatory zone because of special features or constraints unique to the property involved. This article does not give the power to take action which, in effect, allows a land use in contravention of the applicable regulatory zone or in any other way changes the applicable regulatory zone. This article cannot be used to vary the maximum size of an affordable dwelling unit. 
Section 102.114. - Requirements for Application. 
A.  Applications for variances may be initiated by the property owner or a property owner's authorized agent, any aggrieved or adversely affected person, as defined by Fla. Stat. § 163.3215(2).

3.  Proposed site plan which clearly delineates the locations and extent of the regulation to be varied; and 
4.  Additional requirements as may be determined by the Director. 
C.  No variance shall be processed until the information necessary to review and decide upon the proposed variance is deemed complete by the Director. 
Section 102.115. - Review and Approval Procedures. 
    The PC and the Director shall review variances in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
A.  General Provisions: After proper notice, the PC shall conduct a quasi-judicial public hearing with notification for the purpose of receiving oral and written evidence relative to the application. The evidence shall be reviewed to determine if the application is consistent with existing policies, standards and required findings. 
B.  Concurrent Processing of Applications: A variance request related to additional LDRs action(s) which requires PC review shall be consolidated into (1) one hearing before the appropriate approval authority for the major request being considered. 
C.  Floodplain Variance: In addition to the provisions of this article, an application for a variance of the floodplain management provisions of Article 12, "100-Year Floodplain" of Chapter 107 shall be subject to the variance requirements of that article. 
Section 102.116. - Time Period for Hearing and Action. 
    Public hearings conducted by the PC shall be held within 90 working days from the date of acceptance of the complete application. The PC may take action on the proposed variance at the conclusion of the public hearing, but shall take action no later then 95 working days after the complete application was accepted. An extension of time for the PC action may be granted if mutually agreed upon between the applicant and the Director. Failure of the PC to hold a public hearing or take action within the time frames provided in this article shall constitute approval of the application. 
Section 102.117. - Effective Date of Action. 
    Action on the variance application, unless otherwise specified, shall be effective upon expiration of the appeal period. Notice shall be given in accordance with the provisions of this section.

    Public notice according to Article 4, "Notice of Public Meetings and Hearings", of this chapter, shall be sent to the following: 
A.  All owners of real property that are the subject of the variance; 
B.  All owners of real property: 
1.  Within 100 feet of the property which is the subject of the variance when the variance request is for an administrative deviation of 25 percent or less; or 
2.  Within 300 feet of the property which is the subject of the variance when the variance request is for a deviation of 26 percent or more. 
Section 102.119. - Compliance with Noticing Requirements. 
    Owners of all real property to be noticed pursuant to this section shall be those owners identified on the latest Monroe County Assessor's ownership maps and records. Such notice is complied with when the notice is sent to the last known addresses of such real property owners as identified in the latest County Assessor's records. Any person who attends the public hearing shall be considered to be legally noticed unless those persons can provide evidence that they were not notified according to the provisions of this section. 
Section 102.120. - Approval Standard. 
    Prior to approving an application for a variance, the PC or Director shall find that all of the following apply to the property: 
A.  Special Circumstances: Because of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of the specific piece of property;

Petroleum absorbent materials shall also be kept available to absorb fuel spills on the surface water or on land. Reporting requirements for fuel spills shall be followed as per Coast Guard regulations. All staff at fueling facilities shall have proper training in the deployment of fuel spill equipment and materials. 
(b)  Fueling: Fuel nozzles must have automatic back pressure shutoffs and must not have a holding clip to keep the nozzle open (i.e., the nozzle shall only be held open by hand.) In the immediate vicinity of the dispenser, there must be petroleum absorbent pads readily accessible in the event of a small spill. A petroleum absorbent pad should be held next to the nozzle while filling, to catch small accidental spills and the few drops of fuel that fall from the nozzle when it is removed from the fill fitting. If fuel accidentally spills in the water or onto the ground, the person fueling the boat shall use the absorbent pads to remove the fuel from the water surface or from the ground. These absorbent pads shall be dried in the open air under sunlight and may then be disposed of with the regular trash. 
(c)  Mobile Fueling Operations: Mobile fueling operations at any permitted facility shall be the joint responsibility of the permitted marine facility, the tank truck operator, and the vessel owner. 
20.  Bilge Wastewater (general): Bilge wastewater that is not contaminated by oil, fuel or other regulated contaminants may be discharged onto surface waters or on land. Federal, state and local regulations prohibit the discharge of bilge wastewater and "gray" water that is contaminated by oil, fuel or other regulated contaminants. Boat owners shall be liable for complying with these regulations and marine facilities shall inform them of this. Marine facilities shall have supplies and equipment available to remove oil and fuel from bilge water so that it may be legally discharged. These shall include petroleum absorbents and a written action plan to deal with larger quantities of oil, fuel or other regulated contaminants. 
"Gray" water shall mean wastewater from galley operations (dishwashing) and from hand basins and showers. 
21.  Used Lead-Acid Batteries (general): Used lead acid batteries must be stored on an impervious surface, under cover, and sent to or picked up by an approved recycler. Receipts and records must be retained for inspection. 
22.  Pressure Cleaning (general): The use of high or low pressure water cleaning equipment for the initial rinse-off of a vessel hauled from the water is acceptable. However, any accumulated algae, oyster or barnacle build-up must be properly collected and disposed of in the regular trash. The use of this equipment to remove bottom paint from hulls shall be restricted to an area with an impervious surface, where the wastewater shall be contained, collected and treated to remove paint solids. 
23.  Automated Boat Washing Facilities (similar in concept to existing automated car washing facilities) (general): Waste wash water generated by an automated boat washing facility shall be considered "industrial wastewater". 
24.  Bottom Paint Removal (general): Paints containing tin compounds are regulated by the EPA and these paints may be applied or removed only by persons or organizations licensed by the EPA. The EPA regulations regarding storage, application, disposal of paint containers and paint residues, sanding dust, etc. are incorporated herein by reference. 
Paint containing copper compounds shall be removed as follows: 
(a)  Wet: Removing copper bottom paint by high pressure water or with a low pressure hose and a scrubber or scraper produces "industrial wastewater". As a result, this activity must be conducted over an impervious surface (not over open ground) with a retaining berm so that the wastewater can be contained. This wastewater may be recycled or disposed of, but prior to disposal, it must be treated so as to reduce the levels of concentrations of heavy metals (principally copper) and meet the applicable standards for wastewater disposal Paint solids may be collected and disposed of with the regular trash if placed in double plastic bags. 
(b)  Dry: Removing copper bottom paint by dry sanding (either by hand or with power tools) produces a sanding dust containing potentially hazardous metals (principally copper). This sanding must be done over an impervious surface (not over open ground) and there must be a berm or retaining wall surrounding the area so that the sanding dust can be swept up or vacuumed up, double bagged in plastic, and disposed of with the regular trash. 
25.  Hand Sanding Hull or Topsides (general): There are no restrictions in regard to sanding without power tools, provided that reasonable efforts are taken to control sanding dust. The sanding generated may be swept up and disposed of with the regular trash. 
26.  Sanding Hull or Topsides with Power Tools (general): The sanding dust generated by this activity must be swept up and disposed with the regular trash and may not be intentionally discharged into a storm drain or onto surface waters. 
27.  Engine and Parts Storage (general): Engines and engine parts must be stored on a covered, impervious surface. Care must be taken to prevent oil and grease from leaking onto the open ground. 
28.  Engine Parts Washing (general): Parts washing may not be done over open ground. Parts washing must be done in a container or parts washer. The parts must be rinsed or air dried over the parts cleaning container. The dirty parts washing fluid must be recycled or disposed of by a licensed waste hauler. The preferred disposal method is by a permitted parts washing contractor who brings new fluid and takes away the sludge and dirty fluid. 
29.  Disposal of Solid Waste (general): Disposal or discharge of all solid waste in the waters of City of Marathon is prohibited. All facilities shall provide an adequate number of leak proof containers for the disposal of solid waste and garbage. 
30.  Spray Painting (general): If spray painting is to be done outside of a spray booth, then measures must be taken to contain the overspray. Measures such as impervious shields, screens or tarpaulins may control the overspray; however more stringent control measures may be required for site specific applications. Spray painting can only be done over an impervious surface such as asphalt, concrete or a tarpaulin, so that the paint does not contact the open ground. When spray painting is to be done on a vessel in the water, both floats and screens must be used so that overspray or other process materials do not enter the surface waters. If winds increase to the speed where overspray cannot be controlled, the spray painting must cease until the winds diminish. 
(a)  It is the responsibility of the facility to have Material Safety Data sheets on the products being used in spray painting operations. This information will determine how the waste products generated by spray painting are to be disposed of. Waste solvents, catalysts and paint mixtures should be collected in DOT approved containers and may be recycled or disposed of by a permitted hazardous transporter. 
(b)  Each facility is responsible for the actions of its employees and for the actions of independent contractors and it is the responsibility of the facility to inform such persons of the possible enforcement action and citations for violations of the regulations pertaining to spray painting. 
31.  Sandblasting (general): During sandblasting operations, the facility must provide "reasonable and adequate" measures to contain the waste generated by the sandblasting process. For example, sandblasting shall take place only over an impervious surface and not over open ground, and the waste generated shall not enter the surface waters. Screens, shields or tarpaulins shall be used to control the dust generated by sandblasting. Sandblasting shall not take place during periods of high winds when it is impossible to control the waste material. Sandblasting of tin-based paints generates a RCRA Hazardous Waste subject to strict EPA regulations, including regulations controlling the disposal of the waste material. 
The sandblasting of steel hulls may generate a hazardous waste material. The facility can determine this by testing a composite profile sample. If the test establishes that the waste material is hazardous, then it must be disposed of as RCRA Hazardous Waste. If the material is nonhazardous, then it can be disposed of as described above, depending on the quantity. 
32.  Asbestos Removal (general): Facilities involved in the renovation or demolition of marine vessels should be aware of the very stringent Federal and State regulations relating to the disturbance of asbestos containing materials. 
33.  Hazardous Waste Management (general): Any hazardous wastes not already covered in these BMPs must be disposed of properly. It is the responsibility of the marina owner to be aware of the quantity of hazardous waste generated at the marina and its EPA classification. Marina must comply with all EPA requirements of its classification. Marina should provide convenient containers for the disposal of small quantities of hazardous waste generated by marina patrons. 
34.  Stormwater runoff (general): The EPA "NPDES" program, City of Marathon, and State of Florida require that each marine facility have a plan detailing how the facility deals with its rainwater runoff and the pollution carried by rainwater. 
35.  Boat Cleaning in the Water (general): Pressure washing should not be used for boat cleaning in the water. In the water hull scraping and any other abrasive process is discouraged. Detergents containing ammonia, sodium hypochlorite, chlorinate solvents, petroleum distillates, lye, or any traditional sudsing detergents that must be rinsed off are prohibited. Boaters should be encouraged to use biodegradable and phosphate-free soaps and detergents. 
36.  Mercury Containing Lamps and Devices (general): Provide watertight containers in secure areas for the disposal of unusable mercury bilge pump float switches and a/c thermostats. Containers should be clearly marked and preferably indoors. Properly recycle or dispose of leaking switches. 
37.  Fire Safety (general): Smoking should be prohibited near fueling operations. Marina should have an evacuation plan for people and boats in case of fire. Ensure that marina is up to date on all local fire department regulations.

The regulations in this chapter are intended to mitigate potential problems and hazards, and to ensure consistency with community character and the provisions of the Plan. 

Section 104.00. - Purpose and Intent. 
    Certain uses have unique characteristics that require the imposition of development criteria in order to ensure that they are not harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of residents, surrounding uses and surrounding properties. These criteria may be applied in relation to use, occupancy, location, construction, design, character, scale, manner of operation, or the necessity for making complex or unusual determinations. The uses are listed in this article together with the specific criteria that apply to each use, whether a permitted, a limited, an accessory or a conditional use. The uses are listed in alphabetical order and follow the Use Table (Table 103.15.1) in Chapter 103. These criteria shall be met in addition to all other standards of the LDRs, unless specifically exempted, and all applicable regulations of other governmental agencies. 
Section 104.01. - Levels of Review for Uses. 
    Four (4) types of Uses are identified in Table 103.15.1. The uses are listed in alphabetical order. They are denoted by Permitted (P), Limited (L), Accessory (A), or Conditional (C) lettering which indicates the Level of Review necessary to ensure the conditions are appropriately applied. 
Permitted "P" uses are permitted by right and reviewed at the staff level through an existing permit procedure. Uses listed with a P might have extra conditions which are listed in the following section. 
Limited "L" uses are reviewed by the staff but may involve multiple issues or departments. These uses are only permitted on a limited level through a special administrative approval process. 
Accessory "A" uses are reviewed by the staff but may involve multiple issues or departments. These uses are only permitted an accessory to the principal structure or use on the property.

This requirement may be waived upon the written certification by the Director that the minimum distance separation has been met. 
(c)  The location of all existing places of business subject to this section shall not in any manner be impaired by this section, and the distance limitation provided in this section shall not impair any existing licensed location heretofore issued to and held by any such vendor nor shall such vendor's right of renewal be impaired by this section; provided, however, that the location of any such existing license shall not be transferred to a new location in violation of this section.

Chapter 106 - NATURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES PROTECTION 
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL 

Section 106.00. - Purpose and Intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to: 
A.  Preserve, protect, and improve the public health, safety, general welfare, and quality of life of the citizens of the City of Marathon, by conserving, managing, restoring, or enhancing natural and human-related resources that provide a healthful array of human, plant and animal life; 
B.  Implement the Comprehensive Plan, with particular emphasis on preserving and protecting biodiversity and the ecological values and functions of hammocks, wetlands, open bodies of water and flora and fauna; and 
C.  Protect the natural resources, open spaces, and historic character of the community in a manner that preserves and cultivates a unique sense of place while fostering economic well-being, maintaining adequate quality and quantity of water and land, and minimizing the present and future vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards. 
Section 106.01. - Natural and Historic Resources Regulated. 
    It is unlawful for any person to develop any natural or historic resource regulated under this chapter without first obtaining the required natural or historic resources review and approval. 
Section 106.02. - Use of Sound Environmental Practices. 
    The provisions in this chapter are intended to accommodate development while also protecting and preserving valuable natural and historic resources. To further this objective, applicants shall be required to use sound environmental practices, and to plan for proposed activities and projects in the context of natural systems and historic features of the landscape. Applicants are required to use conservation design techniques such as clustering and density transfer to produce marketable projects while protecting natural and historic resources. 
A.  Satisfaction of Open Space Requirements: When land development involves a parcel that contains regulated natural or historic resources, the City's open space requirements shall be fulfilled first with regulated natural or historic resources. These natural resource areas shall be protected as conservation management areas through a Grant of Conservation Easement in accordance with Article 8 "Conservation Management Areas". 
B.  Clustering in Natural Areas: Avoidance or minimization shall be required for all natural areas (habitats pursuant to Chapter 106, Article 3, Table 106.16.1) to the maximum extent feasible. Where the applicant demonstrates that all reasonable steps have been taken in the attempt to avoid significant adverse impact to regulated natural resources, and proposed impact is consistent with the upland habitat limitations of this chapter (see required open space percentages in Table 106.16.1), development in regulated upland resource areas may be authorized as follows: 
1.  Shall not constitute a significant adverse impact. 
2.  Allowed units or commercial intensity (FAR) shall be calculated based on the allowed densities in the FLUM and zoning district within which the parcel proposed for development lies. This calculation shall be made for the entire area of the subject parcel(s) proposed for development. However, development shall be limited from the perspective of habitat class and open space (Table 106.16.1) in accordance with the clustering criteria established in Section 106.16, requiring the placement of development in the least sensitive habitat first, then the next least sensitive habitat, etc. The maximum density for any parcel shall be subject to the density allowed pursuant to Section 103, Article 3, Table 103.15.2, "Density, Intensity, and Dimensions for Zoning Districts" for all habitats which are provided density under the LDRs. Density within any Class I or II habitat within a parcel subject to development may be exceeded as long as the open space requirements are met and the density for the total area of the parcel is not exceeded. All aspects of the LDRs must be met, particularly open space requirements, setbacks and height. For residential uses, reasonable access shall be allowed as follows: 
(a)  A driveway shall not exceed 12 feet in width serving single-family uses; and 24 feet serving multi-family parcels (excluding roadways serving multiple-family parcels); and 
(b)  Driveways and roadways shall be located and designed to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on the protected resource(s), balancing such resource protection with the need for safe access to the site. When driveways are proposed to pass through Class III habitats within which regulated trees or native vegetation are identified, the driveway should be placed to minimize the removal of these regulated species to the greatest extent practicable and in accordance with the provisions established in Article 2 of this chapter. 
4.  Parcels, lots, building areas, and driveways shall be configured to minimize overall impact to ecosystem integrity (Class I and II habitats), utilizing reduced construction footprints, or modified or innovative construction techniques. Modification of the development footprint shall minimize the impact on existing native understory and canopy trees. 
5.  Development shall be clustered on the least environmentally sensitive portion of the parcel as listed in Table 106.16.1. When a parcel proposed for development contains more than one (1) habitat type, all development shall be clustered in the least environmentally sensitive portions of the parcel. Development permitted on the least sensitive portion(s) of a parcel shall be clustered within that portion(s) of the parcel to avoid impacts on existing native understory and canopy vegetation; shall achieve the maximum density or intensity possible without violating other aspects of the LDRs; shall fully utilize the net buildable area of the habitat prior to expanding to the next least sensitive habitat type on the site; and in no instance shall the density or intensity of the parcel(s) subject to development exceed the density or intensity allowed for the sum of all habitats provided density or intensity under the LDRs (See Table 103.15.2, "Density, Intensity, and Dimensions for Zoning Districts.") If the parcel(s) subject to development only exhibit Class III habitats as defined in Table 106.16.1, then the standards applied will be in accordance with Article 2 of this chapter. 
6.  Clearing of native vegetation (Class I and II habitats) shall be limited to the immediate development area which shall be shown as the area of approved clearing on the site plan approved by the City Biologist and shall be subject to the mitigation and management requirements of this chapter. Clearing or transplantation of and mitigation for regulated trees or native vegetation found in Class III habitats shall be permitted in accordance with Article 2 of this chapter. 
7.  Champion trees and specimen trees shall not be disturbed. 
8.  No impact shall be allowed to wetlands or associated wetland buffer areas (Class I and II habitats), except as consistent with the requirements of Section 106.28 "Water Resource and Wetland Buffer". 
C.  Eligibility for Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Transfers of Development Rights (TDR) may be proposed for two (2) or more separate tracts of land to facilitate transfers of density rights from regulated natural resource areas pursuant to Article 3 "Transfer of Development Rights", Chapter 107. Such sending sites shall be designated as conservation areas on the City of Marathon Habitat Maps and shall be protected as conservation management areas through a Grant of Conservation Easement.

ARTICLE 3. - NATURAL PLANT AND WILDLIFE HABITAT 

Section 106.13. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Article is to implement the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan, to protect natural upland plant communities which have the potential to maintain healthy and diverse populations of plants or wildlife, to preserve the ecological values and functions of significant plant and wildlife habitats, to provide for habitat corridors and minimize habitat fragmentation, in order to maintain and enhance the diversity and distribution of plant and animal species which are of aesthetic, ecological, economic, educational, historical, recreational, or scientific value to the City and its citizens. 
Section 106.14. - Applicability. 
    Development activities on all parcels containing natural plant and wildlife habitat (including hammocks, cactus barrens, beaches, and all wetland types listed in Table 106.16.1) or listed species habitat shall be evaluated by the City Biologist prior to any approval for alteration of the habitat. 
Section 106.15. - Habitat Connectivity Preservation. 
    Parcels containing natural plant and animal habitat shall not be segmented, processed in piecemeal fashion, reviewed or developed in any manner that results in lesser natural resources protections than would otherwise be required if all land under common ownership or control were considered as a single proposal. 
Section 106.16. - Clustering. 
    Natural plants, animals and wildlife habitat of any size shall remain undisturbed to the greatest extent practicable; therefore, clustering of the development shall be required, subject to the habitat classification open space requirements in Table 106.16.1 and the mitigation and monitoring requirements of Article 10. To this end, the following shall be required: 
A.  A detailed natural resources assessment shall be provided for the proposed project area according to this chapter. The assessment shall be used to confirm or to assist in modifying existing habitat information such as the City of Marathon, Comprehensive Plan Map Book, Map 4: Habitat Types. Regulated natural and historic resources shall be inventoried using the best available data for the remainder of the planning parcel, and all natural plant and wildlife habitat and listed species habitat shall be identified. If the natural resources assessment indicates that the property in question is characterized by different habitats than are listed in the Comprehensive Plan Map Book, then such information will be utilized to determine the limitations of development under this section. For clarity, the assessment should only utilize habitat types as defined in this section. If it is determined that a habitat type exists which is not otherwise found in Table 106.16.1, the responsible biologist should identify the habitat type and why it doesn't fit into the typical descriptive types in Table 106.16.1. 
B.  Where regulated habitat or listed species habitat is identified, in order to proceed, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed project will minimize disturbance of the connectivity of the habitat corridor and will be clustered on the least sensitive portion of the parcel according to habitat classification, pursuant to Table 106.16.1. An area containing Class III habitat is considered the least environmentally sensitive and an area containing Class I habitat is considered the most environmentally sensitive. The habitats within each class category in Table 106.16.1 are listed in order of sensitivity from greatest sensitivity to least sensitivity. Class III habitats generally are not considered regulated natural resources pursuant to this article. However, it is recognized that these habitats may have individual regulated trees, small clusters of regulated trees, and other native vegetation. As such, protection of this vegetation shall be regulated exclusively under the provisions of Article 2 of this chapter. If individual or clusters of regulated trees and areas of native vegetation are identified within the habitat then under any development scenario, including subdivision and platting, these areas should be avoided if possible pursuant to Article 2. 
C.  Unless otherwise exempted herein, a management plan for the parcel shall be prepared pursuant to Article 9 "Management Plans" which shall be subject to approval by the TRC.

The applicant shall not be required to submit a habitat analysis where the habitat does not contain tropical hardwood hammocks but the City Biologist may require a vegetation survey. When a habitat analysis is not provided, presence of listed species may be presumed and habitat protected in accordance with the standards outlined in this Section, in any of the following circumstances: 
1.  A listed species individual has been recently documented on the planning parcel; 
2.  A portion of the planning parcel is within the known or suspected range of certain listed species; or 
3.  The land by itself, or in connection with other lands, meets the minimum habitat needs for a viable population, nesting pair, or nesting colony of listed species. 
Section 106.18. - Habitat Analysis. 
    If the tropical hardwood hammock does not automatically qualify for one (1) of the high quality categories, as established in 106.17 A. above, as a part of an application for approval of development on lands classified on the Habitat map as tropical hardwood hammock, an applicant shall submit a habitat analysis prepared by a qualified biologist pursuant to the methodology and standards contained in this Section. Such analysis is subject to approval by the City Biologist. The City Biologist may, after a site visit, waive or limit the requirements for a habitat analysis. 
A.  General Mapping: The locations and general extent of natural communities that comprise natural plant and animal habitat are shown on the City of Marathon Habitat and Species Maps. These maps should be used as a guide and are subject to verification via site inspection and periodic data updates. A final determination of habitat types, locations and boundaries and the use or value of the habitat to listed species shall be made by the City Biologist. 
B.  Site-specific Identification: 
1.  The applicant shall review and analyze various digital data sources, including, but not limited to the following: 
(a)  City of Marathon Habitat and Species Maps.

(e)  Fourteen to 18 native woody species present shall receive a score of 2.0. 
(f)  Nine (9) to 13 native woody species present shall receive a score of 1.0. 
(g)  Less than nine (9) native woody species shall receive a score of zero. 
4.  Threatened, Endangered, Commercially Exploited and Regionally Important Plants: A hammock that provides habitat and conditions for regulated plants to flourish has a relatively significant ecological and cultural value and which contains: 
(a)  Ten (10) or more listed species present shall receive a score of 3.0. 
(b)  Five (5) to nine (9) listed species present shall receive a score of 2.0. 
(c)  One (1) to four (4) listed species present shall receive a score of 1.0. 
(d)  No listed species present shall receive a score of zero. 
5.  Invasive exotic plant infestations: The more susceptible (less resistant) a hammock is to exotic invasion, the more likely it is that the habitat is of lower complexity or integrity or that it is not sufficiently insulated from such effects. 
(a)  Total invasive exotic infestation of five (5) percent or less indicates a score of 4.0. 
(b)  Total invasive exotic infestation is more than five (5) percent but infestation by combined category 1 invasives is at five (5%) percent or less indicates a score of 3.5.

(f)  More than 30 percent infestation by category 1 invasives indicates a score of zero. 
6.  Threatened and endangered animal species: Hammock that provides habitat for listed animal species is presumed to provide important and intact wildlife refuge areas that should be preserved for ecological and cultural reasons. Potential habitat is extremely important for provision of recovery areas and temporary refuge. 
(a)  The hammock is a known or probable habitat for listed animal species indicates a score of 3.0. 
(b)  The hammock is a potential habitat for listed animal species indicates a score of 2.0. 
(c)  The hammock has no mapped or documented status for listed animal species indicates a score of zero. 
7.  Forest size: Larger forests are less subject to disturbance due to an insulating effect. They are also more likely to contain a higher structural, microhabitat, and species diversity due to the heterogeneous nature of tropical hammock plant distribution. Larger forests are also more attractive habitat for birds and other wildlife as indicated primarily by the keynote species studies done for various birds. 
(a)  The contiguous hammock is ten (10) or more acres in size indicates a score of 5.0. 
(b)  The contiguous hammock is at least seven (7) but less than ten (10) acres in size indicates a score of 4.0. 
(c)  The contiguous hammock is at least four (4) but less than seven (7) acres in size indicates a score of 3.0. 
(d)  The contiguous hammock is at least one (1) but less than four (4) acres in size indicates a score of 2.0. 
(e)  The contiguous hammock is at least 0.375 acres but less than one (1) acre in size indicates a score of 1.0. 
(f)  The contiguous hammock is less than 0.375 acres in size indicates a score of zero. 
8.  Perimeter disturbance: The level of fragmentation of a hammock, measured as the amount of perimeter disturbance related to size, has been shown to lower the resistance of hammocks to direct and secondary effects of the disturbance, especially where development exists. These disturbances include exotic invasion sources, exotic predators, human intrusion, and others. The integrity of the hammock habitat can be lowered by the extent and nature of perimeter disturbance versus the ability of the hammock to withstand it. 
(a)  An edge to area ratio of 0.005 or less indicates a score of 3.0. 
(b)  An edge to area ratio of more than 0.005 but less than 0.01 indicates a score of 2.0. 
(c)  An edge to area ratio of 0.01 or more but less than 0.02 indicates a score of 1.0. 
(d)  An edge to area ratio of 0.02 or more indicates a score of zero. 
9.  Wildlife habitat: A primary hammock function in the Keys is availability of food sources for resident and migratory birds and other animals. In fact, the development of our highly diverse tropical Caribbean hammocks is owed in large part to transport of Caribbean flora by the white-crowned pigeon and other migrating birds. This availability is relatively easy to determine. It is measured by the quality and amount of fruit produced by the hammock. The better the fruit production of the hammock, the more likely it is that birds and other animals on which hammock distribution and seed dispersal depend will utilize the resource. These areas are also considered important for maintenance of resident and migratory bird populations. 
(a)  Fifteen or more species of category 1 fruit producers indicates a score of 3.0. 
(b)  Twelve or more species of category 1 fruit producers, or, 22 or more species of combined categories 1 and 2 fruit producers indicates a score of 2.5. 
(c)  Ten (10) or more species of category 1 fruit producers, or, 18 or more species of combined categories 1 and 2 fruit producers indicates a score of 2.0. 
(d)  Twenty or more species of any category fruit producers indicates a score of 1.5. 
(e)  Fifteen to 19 species of any Category fruit producers (at least one (1) species must be in category 1 or 2) indicates a score of 1.0. 
(f)  Less than 15 of any category fruit producers, or, all fruit producers are in category 3 indicates a score of zero. 
10.  Community connectivity: Nearly as important as size is the landscape position of the hammock within the local island and overall Keys island ecosystem. Isolation from other useable habitats caused by intervening development has short term effects on behavior patterns influencing forest availability to wildlife, and long term effects on dispersal and breeding patterns affecting species populations. 
Award only one (1) of the following scores (if applicable): 
(a)  The hammock is part of a contiguous closed canopy hammock, buttonwood and/or mangrove forest (any combination of these habitats) with a combined contiguous closed canopy of at least 121/2 acres in size but less than 30 acres in size indicates a score of 0.5. 
(b)  The hammock is part of a contiguous closed canopy hammock, buttonwood and/or mangrove forest (any combination of these habitats) with a combined contiguous closed canopy of 30 acres or more in size indicates a score of 1.0.

1.  Woody plant species diversity: Hammocks with higher diversity are ecologically and culturally significant in that they are a natural seed source for plant species dispersal and may represent more mature forests. These hammocks represent a storehouse of biological diversity and essentially define hardwood forest character in the Florida Keys. 
(a)  Twenty-three or more native woody species present indicates a score of 6.0. 
(b)  Twenty to 22 native woody species present indicates a score of 5.0. 
(c)  Seventeen to 19 native woody species present indicates a score of 4.0. 
(d)  Fourteen to 16 native woody species present indicates a score of 3.0.

(g)  Less than eight (8) native woody species present indicates a score of zero. 
2.  Threatened, endangered, commercially exploited and regionally important plants: Hammocks that provide habitat and conditions for rare and listed plants to flourish have a relatively significant ecological and cultural value. The presence of rare plants often indicates a greater habitat stability in terms of microclimate and niche availability for these plants. 
(a)  Six (6) or more listed species present indicates a score 3.0. 
(b)  Three (3) to five (5) listed species present indicates a score of 2.0. 
(c)  One (1) to two (2) listed species present indicates a score of 1.0. 
(d)  No listed species present indicates a score of zero. 
3.  Invasive exotic plant infestations: The more susceptible (less resistant) a hammock is to exotic invasion, the more likely it is that the habitat is of lower complexity or integrity or that it is not sufficiently insulated from such effects. 
(a)  Total invasive exotic infestation of five (5) percent or less indicates a score of 4.0. 
(b)  Total invasive exotic infestation is more than five (5) percent but infestation by combined category 1 invasives is at five (5) percent or less indicates a score of 3.5.

F.  Palm Hammocks: If a low hammock has an abundance and density of thatch palms such that 20 percent of the dominant canopy plants or any portion thereof are palms, the hammock shall be considered a palm hammock. 
Section 106.19. - Onsite Protection. 
    All high quality hammocks shall be designated and permanently protected in place on the site and managed in accordance with the standards in Article 8 of this chapter for Conservation Management Areas. Low and moderate quality hammocks may qualify for alternatives to in place and on-site protection subject to the limitations of this section, Article 8 Conservation Management Areas and the mitigation and monitoring provisions of Article 9 of this chapter. 
A.  Conditions of Approval: Development approval conditions may limit or preclude development of structures, impervious surfaces, and other uses within an appropriate distance from locations of protected habitat, if necessary for the continued viability of the protected habitat. The following special design standards may be required adjacent to protected listed species habitat to minimize disturbance: 
1.  A minimum setback from the protected listed species habitat may be required for construction activities. The setback distance would be determined on a case-by-case basis by the City Biologist, and in no case shall it be less than ten (10) feet. Clearing, grading, and filling may be prohibited within the setback area unless the applicant can demonstrate that habitat within the protected area will not be damaged. 
2.  Landscaping within associated buffers or construction setbacks shall require utilization of native vegetation that is compatible with existing native plant communities, soils, and climatic conditions. 
B.  Boundaries of the Protected Habitat: The boundaries of the protected habitat shall be designated in a certified survey submitted to the City for approval prior to issuance of the development approval. 
Section 106.20. - Alternatives to Onsite Habitat Protection. 
A.  When Considered: Alternatives to on-site protection for low or moderate quality hammock, that is not located within the minimum required open space area, may be considered in the following circumstances: 
1.  When physical constraints of the parcel preclude maintenance of ecological integrity of preserved vegetation, given considerations as to size of the development site, habitat quality, connectivity, adjacent uses, and feasibility of management; 
2.  When opportunities exist for long-term protection and management of significant habitat of equal or greater habitat value than would not have otherwise been protected; or 
3.  When establishment of conservation management areas within a project would result in small, fragmented areas with limited habitat value compared to available alternatives. 
B.  Standards: If protection of the existing natural plant and animal habitat area outside of the required open space is not feasible due to one (1) of the circumstances identified in this section, an applicant may, with the approval of the City Biologist and state or federal agencies or SFWMD, if applicable, pursue one (1) of the following options: 
1.  The applicant may relocate existing vegetation to another portion of the site or establish a new area of natural plant and animal vegetation on another portion of the site in accordance with the requirements of Article 9, "Avoidance, Minimization, Mitigation and Monitoring" and as part of an approved management plan in accordance with the requirements of Article 8, "Management Plans" of this chapter; or 
2.  The applicant may provide an off-site management area pursuant to Article 8 of this chapter. The City may consider alternative proposals that provide equal or greater protection; or 
3.  Alternatives to on-site protection shall be evaluated and approved by the City Biologist in accordance with the criteria of this chapter. In any case, strict adherence to the minimum open space percentages for each individual habitat on the development site is required and in addition, no habitat within the buildable area of a parcel may be altered unless part of an approved clearing plan containing approved development (i.e., removal of natural habitat strictly for the purpose of providing lawns, gardens and the like is prohibited). 
C.  Payment in Restoration Fund: If determined in writing by the City Biologist that onsite transplantation will not be conducive to the long term survivability of the plants, the applicant shall comply with one (1) of the following: 
1.  The applicant shall pay a fee, according to the schedule of fees established by Council into the City Restoration Fund; or 
2.  Subject to the consent of the City, the applicant shall donate nursery stock identical in species composition to that which will be lost to development. Stock shall be donated according to the replacement schedule established in Table 106.11.1 Tree Removal Mitigation Table. 
D.  Other Alternatives: The City may consider alternative mitigation proposals which provide greater protection. 
Section 106.21. - Management Plan. 
    If the habitat survey identifies the presence of listed species or listed species habitat, or potential for adverse impacts to any listed species habitat, the applicant shall submit to the City for review and approval a management plan that ensures protection of the habitat, as conservation management areas, pursuant to Article 8 of this chapter, with no adverse effect on species survival. The management plan shall meet the requirements of Article 9, "Management Plans" of this chapter and the standards set forth in this article. 
Section 106.22. - Intergovernmental Coordination. 
    Where listed species are regulated by the state or federal government, the applicant shall complete and submit to the City the habitat survey and associated management or mitigation plans prior to or concurrent with submittal of applications to the relevant state or federal agency. The City shall consult and coordinate with appropriate agencies to streamline the permitting process. All activities shall comply with applicable state and federal laws, regulations, performance standards, and management guidelines. 
Section 106.23. - Limit to Other Regulatory Authority. 
    The applicant is responsible for meeting the permitting criteria for federal and state regulatory agencies regarding the disturbance of any natural plant and animal habitat. The issuance of a dredge and fill permit, environmental resource permit, or other such permit or approval by a federal or state agency, water management district, or other governing body shall not obligate the City of Marathon to grant approval pursuant to this section, and shall not be deemed to satisfy the requirements of the LDRs. 
Section 106.24. - Violations. 
    For the purposes of this Section, the alteration or removal of any listed species habitat without prior review and approval shall be considered a violation. 
ARTICLE 4. - OPEN WATER, SURFACE WATERS AND WETLANDS 

Section 106.25. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to preserve, protect, and improve the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of City of Marathon, and to conserve and protect open bodies of water, surface waters, submerged lands, wetlands, and the natural and scenic resources of [the] City of Marathon, and to implement the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 106.26. - Applicability. 
A.  Waters Included: A water resource is a comprehensive term that includes: 
1.  All those waters; having a measurable salinity at some point during the tidal cycle and lying within the legal boundaries of the City; or 
2.  All those areas which are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation specifically adapted to life in saturated conditions, as listed in the Florida Administrative Code. These waters include, but are not limited to, lakes, and open waters, whether such waters are on private or public lands and whether such waters are man-made or natural. 
B.  Regulated Activities: Except as otherwise expressly provided in this article, no alteration shall occur in, on or over a surface water or wetland area or buffer, and no alteration shall occur adjacent to or connected to a surface water or wetland area, such that the water regime is modified in a way that precludes the area in question from maintaining surface water or hydroperiod necessary to sustain wetland structure and function equivalent to pre-alteration levels 
Section 106.27. - Jurisdiction and Delineation. 
    The City of Marathon shall have regulatory authority over all open waters within 1,200 feet of the shoreline, all surface waters and all wetlands located within the City. 
A.  Delineation Methodology: The City of Marathon shall utilize the uniform statewide methodology adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and Water Management Districts to delineate wetlands, as outlined in Florida Administrative Code Rule 62-340.300 for wetlands, and Rule 62-340.600 for surface waters. The City shall not be limited by the threshold or connection requirements utilized by these agencies for purposes other than delineation. 
B.  General Mapping: The locations and general extent of surface waters and wetlands in the City of Marathon are generally depicted on the City of Marathon Habitat Maps. The maps are intended for use only as a general reference for determining location and approximate extent of surface waters and wetlands. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all open water, surface waters and wetlands, and adjacent areas, and shall not be limited to those depicted on maps described above. 
C.  Site Specific Determination: 
1.  Applicants for any activity in, on or over a jurisdictional surface water or wetland or buffer, or adjacent to (same or contiguous tax parcel) or connected to a surface water or wetland, regardless of size, shall be required to submit a natural resources assessment that includes identification of all surface waters, wetlands, and buffers. Applicants are encouraged to arrange a concept meeting with City staff prior to submittal of an application. 
2.  The City shall provide verification of the development potential of wetlands prior to approval of any activity in a buffer area or on or adjacent to a surface water or wetland utilizing the Keys Wetland Evaluation Procedure (KEYWEP), herein incorporated by reference and the Uniform Mitigation Assessment Methodology (UMAM) as set forth in Chapter 62-345, Florida Administrative Code and reasonable scientific judgment. Wetland quality categories based upon the KEYWEP scoring are: 
(a)  "Red-flag" wetlands have a high level of functional capacity and lack of disturbance. Any type of development is prohibited. 
(b)  High functional capacity wetlands score at 5.5 or higher, regardless of previous disturbance. Any type of development is prohibited. 
(c)  Moderate functional capacity wetlands score below 5.5 but greater than or equal to 4.6. These wetlands are suitable for development with appropriate mitigation. 
(d)  Low functional capacity wetlands score less than 4.6 or are assigned a "green-flag" designation as suitable for development with appropriate mitigation. 
3.  If the applicant has received a delineation of the extent of a surface water or wetland by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or the South Florida Water Management District, pursuant to a formal determination under Fla. Stat. § 373.421(2), or pursuant to a permit issued under Fla. Stat. Chapter 373, in which the delineation was field-verified by the permitting agency and specifically approved in the permit, the delineation shall be binding on the City for the duration of the formal determination or federal or state permit.

L.  In conjunction with other projects, the project will not result in cumulative impacts that in the aggregate fail the criteria of this section. 
M.  Land and Water Uses Classified and Prioritized: 
1.  Water Dependent: The following non-exhaustive list of land and water uses and activities are considered to be "water-dependent." Such uses are economically and physically dependent upon a coastal location and are given a higher priority than those land and water uses and activities that are not water-dependent. Water-dependent uses include, but may not be limited to: 
(a)  Boat harbors; 
(b)  Freight, fuel or other docks; 
(c)  Marine-based tourism facilities;

(b)  Residential development. 
3.  Prioritization of Uses: 
(a)  Facilities for water-dependent recreation, such as fishing, swimming, and boating, and water-related recreation such as picnicking, hiking and walking shall be located near the shoreline, while non-water-related recreation facilities shall be located upland where practicable. 
(b)  Uses and activities that are neither water-dependent nor water-related, but for which there is no practicable upland alternative to meet the public need for the use or activity, receive the lowest priority for a coastal location. 
Section 106.30. - Permanent Protection. 
    Applicants not exempted under this Section shall be required to designate and protect through a Grant of Conservation Easement in conservation management area all surface waters, wetlands, and associated buffers on the parcel for which development activity is proposed, except for those portions on which impact is authorized pursuant to Section 106.33 below. Permanent protection, maintenance and monitoring shall be in accordance with this Chapter. 
Section 106.31. - Mitigation and Monitoring Plan. 
    For projects that do not meet the general approval criteria of this Chapter, and are not specifically exempted by this Section, the City may evaluate proposals for mitigation. Mitigation plans shall be evaluated as part of preliminary plan review by the TRC. 
Section 106.32. - When to Evaluate Mitigation Proposals. 
    Where impact is allowed under one (1) of the scenarios identified in this Section, mitigation shall be required in accordance with this Chapter. Impact may be allowed if all of the following criteria are met: 
A.  Mitigation may be permitted for new wetland loss only where the applicant demonstrates that the activity cannot practically be located on the upland portion of the parcel or contiguous parcels under common ownership or control. The applicant must show that one of the following applies: 
1.  Overriding public interest; or 
2.  All economically viable use of the property is otherwise precluded. 
B.  An applicant may be permitted to mitigate for wetland loss only where the applicant has made all practicable project modifications to avoid and minimize wetland loss and degradation in accordance with this Chapter; 
C.  An applicant may be permitted to mitigate for wetland loss where the applicant can demonstrate that the existing wetlands that are to be converted to upland uses are of low or moderate functional capacity and value based on their size, soils, hydrology, plant and animal life, pursuant to Keys Wetland Evaluation Procedure (KEYWEP); and that the measures necessary to sustain or restore the existing wetlands would be less feasible than the proposed mitigation plan; 
D.  If the 50-foot buffer results in less than 2,000 square feet principal structure, then the setback may be reduced to allow for a 2,000 square foot principal structure of reasonable configuration, provided that a minimum wetland buffer of 25 feet be maintained. 
E.  On properties classified as scarified adjacent to wetlands, the wetland setback may be reduced to 25 feet, without regard to buildable area if the entire setback area is planted and maintained in native vegetation with a site-suitable stormwater management plan that meets the provisions Article 11 "Stormwater Management" of Chapter 107 and thereafter designated as a conservation area, and managed pursuant to the requirements of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of this Chapter. 
F.  The wetland buffer required by this Article shall not apply to mangrove or wetland fringes occurring along man-made canals, channels or basins. 
Section 106.33. - Standards for Accepting Mitigation Proposals. 
    In order to be considered, a mitigation proposal must ensure the long-term viability of the mitigation project, advance the City's natural resources conservation objectives and policies, and meet the minimum standards for mitigation of conservation areas generally as set forth in this Chapter. Specifically: 
A.  Mitigation shall occur in areas designated by the City, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE). A determination by the ACOE or the DEP that mitigation can be satisfied through an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank will also satisfy the City's mitigation requirements. 
B.  Mitigation shall be determined for individual projects by applying the Uniform Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM), pursuant to Chapter 62-345, Florida Administrative Code. 
Section 106.34. - Corrective Action for Unauthorized Impact. 
    In the event that alteration occurs to a wetland or surface water without first obtaining the appropriate review and approval required by this Article, the following corrective actions may be required: 
A.  On-site restoration of buffers, habitat, and hydrology of the original wetland area at a rate of 3:1. 
B.  In the event that damage is irreparable, purchase and permanent protection of comparable natural resource features, including natural communities, shall be required at a ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1 acreage of compensation area to impacted area, based on factors including, but not limited to: habitat rarity, uniqueness, value, function and quality; and the nature, degree and extent of unauthorized impact, as calculated by the City Biologist. 
C.  Payment of an environmental restoration fee calculated as follows: the cost to create or recreate lost function and value of the resource, multiplied by the number of years necessary to restore function and value to pre-alteration levels. The fee shall be deposited into the City Restoration Fund for use in the restoration and management of wetlands. 
D.  In addition to other penalties provided in this Section, the City Attorney may institute or participate in any appropriate civil or administrative action or proceeding to declare, prevent, restrain, correct or abate any violation of any provision of this Article.

Section 106.35. - Shoreline Preservation. 
    All shoreline development shall preserve native upland, wetland, and aquatic vegetation and communities to the maximum extent possible and must offer protection from erosion, contribute to the natural soil building process, provide habitat for a diverse community of endangered, threatened or species of special concern and be aesthetically pleasing and can be reasonably incorporated as a landscaping asset for waterfront development. 
Section 106.36. - Criteria for Approval. 
    In addition to the provisions of Article 1, "Marinas" and "Waterfront Walkways and Docks" of Chapter 104 and Article 5 "Setbacks and Height", Chapter 107, all shoreline development shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Tidal Flushing and Circulation: Coastal development shall be located, designed and operated, to the extent practicable, to minimize adverse impact upon important physical shore features and processes, including tidal flushing and circulation patterns, accretion shore forms, beaches, and littoral drift. Any project that may produce changes in circulation patterns shall be approved only after sufficient hydrographic information is available to allow an accurate evaluation of the possible impacts of the project. 
B.  Scenic Quality: Waterfront businesses shall not detract from the scenic qualities of the shoreline and shall be compatible in design with their surroundings and to the greatest extent practicable shall not significantly block scenic vistas. 
C.  Shoreline Access: New shoreline development shall provide physical and visual access to shorelines when such access does not interfere with operations or present a hazard to life or property. 
D.  Consolidation of Facilities: To the extent practicable, facilities and activities shall be located adjacent to similarly used facilities and areas. 
E.  Compatibility: Activities on and uses of lands and waters shall be compatible with adjacent land and water uses. Compatibility shall be given priority attention when maritime industrial uses locate adjacent to or share facilities with docks used by tourists. Compatibility may be achieved by visual and sound buffering and screening. 
F.  Stormwater and Pollutant Runoff: All structures shall be designed such that stormwater and pollutant runoff is contained on-site, consisted with the stormwater management standards of Article 11 of Chapter 107.

Structures should be made of permeable materials, whenever practical, to allow the infiltration of stormwater runoff. 
G.  Development in the Coastal High Hazard Zone: Development shall be sited, constructed and operated to reduce the impact of flooding, to allow for natural drainage and to minimize damage to life and property. To the extent practicable, development is discouraged within the VE zones. Those areas can be developed if structural requirements reflect the physical opportunities and constraints of the site (e.g., flooding and a high groundwater table) pursuant to Article 12 "100-Year Floodplain" of Chapter 107. 
H.  Hardened Shorelines: Bulkheads, seawalls and other hardened vertical shoreline structures may be permitted on residential canals and altered shorelines only in the following situations and then only where rip-rap or sloping rock revetments in conjunction with biotechnical erosion control and geotextiles or geogrids will not suffice as determined by the City Biologist: 
1.  Bulkheads, seawalls or rip-rap may be allowed when it is replacing an existing deteriorated bulkhead or seawall or to stabilize a severely eroded shoreline area where it is demonstrated that rip-rap with biotechnical erosion control is not sufficient and they are necessary for erosion control. Seawalls may have a cap of two (2) feet in width. 
2.  Bulkheads, seawalls or rip-rap do not constitute a docking facility by themselves. All elements, such as lifts, davits or cleats, which constitute a docking facility, must comply with the requirements of the LDRs for docking facilities. 
3.  No new vertical seawalls or bulkheads shall be permitted on open water shorelines. 
4.  No seawalls, bulkheads, rip-rap, retaining walls or other shoreline hardening structures shall be permitted on or waterward of any portion of a sea turtle nesting beach or within the setback from a sea turtle nesting area. 
5.  The design of the permitted rip-rap, bulkhead or seawall system must include a minimum six-inch retention swale, berm or curb directly landward of the proposed system. 
6.  The bulkhead line shall be located at the average mean high water line of the property at the time a permit for the bulkhead is requested. Reclamation of eroded property through bulkheading and backfilling is prohibited. Significant inconsistencies with adjacent existing bulkheads shall be resolved through the use of angled bulkhead lines and/or rip-rap placed at the base of the new bulkhead. 
7.  Rip-rap or sloping rock revetments shall meet the following guidelines: 
(a)  Be used, with biotechnical erosion control, only to the minimum extent necessary. 
(b)  Be placed landward of any existing mangroves. 
(c)  Whenever feasible, be placed at the base of solid seawalls to dissipate wave energy and provide a substrate for marine organisms. 
(d)  Be constructed in a manner that would not prevent the establishment of native vegetation. 
(e)  Consist only of natural boulders or clean concrete rubble six (6) inches to three (3) feet in diameter (average dimensions). 
(f)  The slope of the rip-rap is no steeper than a ratio of 2 Horizontal to 1 Vertical and the horizontal distance from the landward edge or mean low water line is no more than eight (8) feet. 
(g)  There are no reinforcing rods or other similar protrusions in concrete rubble and all rubble or boulders are free of attached sediments. 
(h)  Neither the distance nor the use of the rip-rap interferes with safe navigation or infringes upon the riparian rights of the adjacent property owners. 
(i)  There is no filling or dredging associated with the placement of rip-rap other than the rip-rap material itself. 
8.  Shoreline stabilization projects on open water that do not conform to the requirements of this Section may only be approved upon a determination by the Director, in consultation with the City Biologist, that the project has a valid public purpose that furthers the objectives, goals and policies of the Plan. 
Section 106.37. - Beach Renourishment. 
A.  Beach renourishment projects shall be subject to the standards pursuant to Fla. Stat. Chapter 161, Chapter 62b-36 F.A.C, Fla.

5.  Siting waste treatment systems and drainfields to prevent discharges that adversely impact the environmental quality of regulated natural and historic resources. 
6.  Limiting residential density and building area in accordance with this chapter. 
7.  Other reasonable protective measures necessary to minimize adverse effects may be required depending on conditions specific to a particular site. 
C.  Mitigation Measures: Where impacts to regulated natural resources cannot be avoided, mitigation may be required subject to the requirements of Section 106.64 below. Mitigation of adverse impacts to environmentally sensitive areas within the City shall be required for both public and private projects, in accordance with criteria specific to the resource and criteria generally applicable to mitigation proposals as set forth herein. 
Section 106.64. - Mitigation. 
    Mitigation of significant adverse impacts on regulated natural resources shall include funding for the acquisition and management, preservation, replacement, or restoration of significant ecological resources. A proposal for mitigation of significant adverse impacts must meet the following general mitigation standards. Mitigation of impact to wetlands and wetland buffers is provided in Article 4 of this chapter. Mitigation of impact to regulated trees is provided in Article 2, "Trees and Native Plants" of this chapter. 
A.  Determination of Impact: Significant adverse impacts to regulated natural resources shall be evaluated based on the terms of the natural function and value of the resource. Mitigation shall be acceptable only where it is determined that mitigation will result in no actual net loss of the resource function and value. 
B.  Characteristics of Mitigation Proposals: All proposals shall provide compensation for all functions and values of the natural habitat. Wetland mitigation shall be determined for individual projects by applying the Uniform Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM), pursuant to Chapter 62-345, Florida Administrative Code as determined in this chapter. The following characteristics shall be included in the proposal: 
1.  The hydrologic, soil, slope, and other basic characteristics of the proposed project must be adequate to achieve proposed project goals. 
2.  The mitigation area must be at least as persistent as the existing natural resource it is intended to replace. 
3.  The size of the mitigation area shall be based on the quality of habitat or vegetation on both the area of impact and the area of proposed mitigation. In the case of wetland resources, the size shall be determined from the results of the UMAM analysis. 
C.  Resource-Based Mitigation: Where mitigation is required by this chapter, resource-based mitigation may be provided on or adjacent to the site, or off-site. The order in which mitigation will be considered shall be: 
1.  On-site Restoration or Enhancement: An applicant may mitigate for impacts on-site by replanting on or adjacent to the parcel, relocating movable resources from one portion to another portion of the parcel, or other measures to restore the quality, function and value of the resource. An easement may be required to ensure the continued viability of the area to be restored or enhanced. 
2.  Off-site Preservation: The applicant may provide off-site mitigation through the preservation of land through off-site dedication, transfer of fee or less than fee simple title to a land conservation agency, nonprofit conservation organization, or other entity approved by the City. Portions of off-site conservation management areas requiring protection under this chapter shall not be used as credit towards a mitigation proposal. Mitigation of impacts to a listed plant or animal species or its habitat that is required by a State or federal agency (such as the ACOE and SFWMD) shall be applied towards off-site mitigation if it is for the same development project and meets the following requirements: 
(a)  Off-site protection sites shall meet all appropriate size, site selection and design, protection, ownership and maintenance, and other provisions of this chapter applicable to onsite conservation management areas. Fencing may be required to control access to the mitigation area. 
(b)  Off-site conservation management areas shall be located in the City and may include: 
i.  Sites composed of addition of land to existing publicly managed areas held for conservation purposes, such as State or City parks or preserves; 
ii.  Sites recommended for preservation or restoration by a State or local governmental land conservation agency; or 
iii.  Other suitable sites within an ecosystem or watershed in proximity to the conservation or preservation area being adversely impacted by development. 
D.  Fee-in-Lieu of Land: As an alternative to the protection of land, the City may allow contribution of a fee-in-lieu-of-land to the environmentally sensitive lands fund, under which the City shall purchase or manage land to protect natural resources in accordance with standards of this chapter. Where fee-in-lieu of land is allowed, the cash payment shall be equivalent to 150 percent of the average per acre-appraised market value, at the time of permit application, multiplied by the number of acres of regulated natural resource for which mitigation is required, plus estimated total cost of management required to establish the viability of that type of resource. 
E.  Submittal of Proposal: A mitigation proposal shall be submitted in conjunction with the requirements for resource assessment requirements under Article 3. The mitigation proposal shall require the same assessment and specify the same details for mitigation areas as required for areas otherwise protected under this chapter. The cost and timing of any monetary contribution or off-site acquisitions shall be specified. A management plan shall be required in accordance with this chapter, and shall include contingency plans for corrective measures or change if performance criteria are not met. 
F.  Mitigation before Alteration: The initial construction, earthwork and planting for mitigation, or payment of fee-in lieu, shall be completed prior to the permitted alteration of regulated natural resources. However, in special situations where the City determines that this requirement will place an unreasonable scheduling hardship on the applicant, the applicant shall post double the required performance guarantee to ensure that the mitigation project will be completed. 
G.  Management and Monitoring: For all mitigation projects, the City shall require management and monitoring for a minimum of five (5) years. This period may be extended as necessary, based on the complexity of the resource or type of mitigation proposed, in order to demonstrate substantial establishment and success of mitigation. In conjunction with a management plan per this chapter, the following shall apply: 
1.  Where plantings are required, success shall be measured by maintenance of 100 percent survivorship rate per species for all planted material. Semi-annual replanting shall be required to maintain required survivorship. 
2.  Nuisance or invasive exotic vegetation shall be eliminated or controlled. 
3.  Monitoring reports of the status of the mitigation area shall be submitted to the City Biologist no less than annually. Indicators appropriate to the resource shall be tracked and evaluated. Such indicators may include water quality chemistry, number of surviving plantings and any plantings made to maintain required survivorship. 
H.  Performance Guarantee: A performance guarantee shall be required in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of mitigation, management and monitoring activities, to ensure the adequate monitoring and long-term viability of mitigation activities. The guarantee shall be provided for the duration of the time period required for maintenance and monitoring, but in no case less than two (2) years. 
1.  Execution: The performance guarantee shall be executed by a person with a bona fide legal interest in the parcel. The performance guarantee shall be kept in full force until all obligations are satisfied. 
2.  Form of guarantee: The guarantee shall be: 
(a)  Cash deposit or certificate of deposit assigned to the City; 
(b)  Escrow agreement for the benefit of the City and on a City approved form; 
(c)  Performance bond issued by a State of Florida registered Guarantee Company which shall be listed by the U.S. Department of Treasury Fiscal Services, Bureau of Government Financial Operations, and on a City-approved form; 
(d)  Irrevocable letter of credit on a City-approved form; or 
(e)  Similar security acceptable to the City. 
3.  Certification: Within six (6) months of the completion of the period established for management and monitoring, the applicant shall submit a final report that includes, at a minimum, the following: 
(a)  Discussion of the projected relative success or failure of the project in mitigating for lost natural resource area value and function; 
(b)  Analysis of measures undertaken during the project that contributed to success; 
(c)  Analysis of problems encountered during the project that decreased success; 
(d)  Recommendations to increase the success of similar, future projects; and Summary of data collected. 
4.  Failure to Mitigate, Manage or Monitor: The City may exercise its option on the performance guarantee in the event that mitigation, management or monitoring is not in compliance with proposed plan. In the event the City exercises its option on the guarantee, all obligations of the applicant under the mitigation and monitoring plan shall cease.

6.  As in the normal BPAS ranking process, BPAS applicants will be re-ranked in future BPAS allocation periods based on existing criteria in this section and the receipt of new or removal of old applicants. Otherwise, this temporary procedure shall apply for all BPAS allocation periods during which the procedure is in effect. 
7.  For any period in which an applicant chooses to defer his or her acceptance of an allocation, that length of time will be subtracted from the total time in the BPAS allocation system for purposes of determining administrative relief. 
H.  The planning process for Land Development Regulation amendments, zone changes, specific plans, and other legislative acts may proceed unaffected by the regulations of this Article. The approval of any such legislative act is not a commitment on the part of the City that the proposal will ultimately receive allocations. 
I.  Within 90 days of receipt of notice of the granting of an allocation award by Council, the applicant must pick up the associated building permit pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 6 of the City Code, unless subject to the provisions of Section 107.10 "Banking or Borrowing of Allocations."

(c)  No revisions shall be made to any aspect of the proposed development which formed the basis for the evaluation review, determination of points and allocation rankings, unless such revision would have the effect of either maintaining or increasing the points originally awarded. 
2.  After the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final inspection: No revision shall be made to any aspect of the completed development which formed the basis for the evaluation, review, determination of points and allocation rankings, unless such revisions are accomplished pursuant to a new building permit and unless such revisions would have the net effect of either maintaining or increasing the points originally awarded. 
L.  Withdrawal of application: An applicant may elect to withdraw a BPAS application without prejudice at any time up to the date of evaluation and ranking. Resubmitted applications shall be considered "new" and shall meet all the requirements of this Article, including payment of appropriate fees and receipt of a new controlling date.

C.  With the exception of development under Section 107.10 "Banking or Borrowing of Allocations", an allocation may only be issued if there is one available in the appropriate allocation category. 
D.  Notice of the allocation hearing shall be mailed (by registered return receipt) to each applicant on the allocation waiting list pursuant to the requirements of Article 4, Chapter 102, "Notice of Public Meetings and Hearings." 
E.  An allocation issued for a permit, or a building permit issued pursuant to an allocation, which expires or is subsequently returned, abandoned, or otherwise voided, may be rolled over into the following year's allocation. Any excess market rate dwelling unit allocations may be rolled over into the next year's allocations provided that at least one-half (1/2) of the unallocated market rate allocations are rolled over into affordable dwelling unit allocations. If the number of unallocated market rate allocations is odd, the odd numbered allocation shall rollover to an affordable allocation.

A.  Road Intersections: 
1.  All corner building sites located in use districts that require a front and side yard shall maintain a clear sight triangle at the intersection of the street rights-of-way for the purpose of traffic safety. 
2.  In clear sight distance at intersections within the area formed by the rights-of-way lines of intersecting roads and a straight line connecting points on such rights-of-way lines, there shall be a clear space with no obstruction to vision between the height of three (3) feet and a height of ten (10) feet above the average grade of each road as measured at the centerline that is consistent with criteria outlined in the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. 
B.  Driveways: Sight distance is also required at driveways to allow the drivers of stopped vehicles a sufficient view of the intersecting street. There shall be a clear space with no obstruction to vision between the height of three (3) feet and a height of eight (8) feet at the intersection of the driveway and the road right-of-way. 
C.  Clear Sight Triangle Requirements: 
1.  At a minimum, the angle of this triangle shall be formed by the intersecting street rights-of-way and the sides of the triangle as measured along the property lines from said angle 20 feet in length; the third side of such triangle shall be a straight line connecting the ends of the two (2) aforementioned lines, as illustrated in Figure 107.43.1, below. 
2.  The City may alter the clear sight triangle. Such alteration is contingent on unusual site topography, proposed site design features, and other unique circumstances pertaining solely to the site and surrounding properties. The City shall make written findings that the alteration does not constitute a traffic or pedestrian safety hazard. 
3.  Street lights, power poles, traffic signs, or similar street fixtures less than one-foot wide or other objects above ten (10) feet in height above the adjacent street elevation shall be allowed in the clear sight triangle unless the City determines that, individually or cumulatively, they would pose a public safety hazard. The Director may authorize other objects in the clear sight triangle which do not comply with this standard upon determining that they would not pose a risk to public safety. 
4.  Trees, either existing or newly planted, shall be permitted in the clear space, provided that foliage is cut away within the prescribed heights. 
5.  The requirements of this Section shall not be deemed to prohibit any necessary retaining wall. 
Figure 107.43.1 
Clear Sight Visibility Triangle 

    Distance from "A" to "B" is the length of leg of the site triangle along the minor road. This distance is measured from the driver's eye in the stopped vehicle to the center of the nearest lane on the major road for vehicles approaching from the left, and to the center of the nearest lane for vehicles approaching from the right. 
    Distance from "A" to "C" is the length of the leg of the sight triangle along the major road measured from the center of the minor road entrance lane.

    All required parking areas shall be striped or marked to show parking spaces and driving aisles. Spaces for motorcycles, persons with disabilities, and bicycles shall be clearly marked. Parking lot signage and marking shall conform with FDOT's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the Americans with Disabilities Act and shall contain no commercial messages. 
Section 107.50. - Shared Parking. 
    The City may recommend approval for a reduction in the number of required parking spaces for a mixed-use project or for uses which are located adjacent to one another and which have different peak parking demands and operating hours. In determining whether to approve a reduction for shared parking, the following shall be considered: 
A.  The application for shared parking shall include a description of the use, a site plan, a trip generation report and a parking study. The parking study shall include the characteristics of each use, peak parking demand, hours of operation and potential improvements in access, design, open space preservation and circulation. 
B.  The minimum number of parking spaces for a mixed-use development or where shared parking strategies are proposed shall be determined by a study prepared by a professional engineer following the procedures of the "Urban Land Institute Shared Parking Report", "ITE Shared Parking Guidelines", Florida Department of Transportation's, "Walkable Communities", April 1995 or other City approved procedures. A formal parking study may be waived for small developments where there is established experience with the land use mix and its impact is expected to be minimal. If standard rates are not available or limited, the applicant may collect data at similar sites to establish local parking demand rates. If the shared parking plan assumes use of an existing parking facility, then field surveys shall be conducted to determine actual parking accumulation. If possible, these surveys should consider the seasonal peak period for the combination of land uses involved. The applicant shall determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for shared parking arrangements or mixed-use developments by the following the following example procedures: 
Step 1: Determine the number of parking spaces that should be provided for each individual use and then sum the results. 
Step 2: Based on the hourly variation in parking demand, determine the peak parking demand for the combined demand of all the uses in the development. Standardized data such as from the ULI, FDOT "Walkable Communities" or ITE reports should be used to estimate hourly variations. Field studies can also be performed on similar land uses within the jurisdiction to establish the hourly variation patterns. This analysis may be needed for both weekdays and weekends, depending on the type of uses involved, and may need to consider seasonal peak periods. 
Step 3: Compare the calculations of the two (2) steps above, and the lesser of the two (2) peak parking demands shall be used as the minimum number of parking spaces that need to be provided. 
C.  All shared parking shall be located in an area providing reasonable access to all uses which the parking is intended to serve. For parking located across US1 from the use, the development shall include a signalized walkway. 
D.  In cases where the uses for which shared parking is requested are located on lots under different ownership, a cross-parking easement shall be recorded in the public record. 
E.  A minimum number of spaces are provided to meet the requirements of the use with the single greatest parking demand. 
Section 107.51. - Parking Reductions or Increases. 
    Applicants for site plan review may vary from the off-street parking schedule in Table 107.52.1 by demonstrating reduced or increased parking demand. The provision of on-street parking may justify a reduction in off-street parking. In all cases, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to the Technical Review Committee to clearly establish that minimum and maximum parking needs shall be accommodated. Where inadequate on-site parking causes a recurring traffic hazard or a nuisance off-site, the owner shall be responsible for increasing the number of parking spaces or decreasing the need for parking spaces. 
Section 107.52. - Parking Area Design Standards. 
A.  Parking Lot Layout: Parking lots may be in different configurations with regard to the angle of the space with the direction of travel of traffic in the aisles. Parallel parking has a zero angle while perpendicular parking has a 90-degree angle. Angled parking is generally laid out at 45 or 60-degree angles. 
B.  Minimum Parking Stall and Aisle Dimensions: 
1.  Parking spaces shall have a minimum width of nine (9) feet except where otherwise provided in this Article; 
2.  The other dimensions of parking spaces and the aisles providing access to such spaces shall meet the dimensional requirements provided in Table 107.52.1 and illustrated in Figure 107.52.1, below.

Section 107.69. - Landscape Plans. 
A.  Planting Plan: A copy of the planting plan shall be submitted to the Department for final review. 
B.  Drawing Requirements: Planting drawings shall indicate all existing and proposed landscape buffers, easements, utilities, right-of-ways, structures, and overhead lines associated with the parcel. 
C.  Natural Vegetation: The preservation and utilization of a site's natural trees, understory, and other vegetation shall be incorporated into the overall site development and planting plans to the greatest extent practicable. 
D.  Xeriscaping: The following principles shall be utilized by the TRC in the review, evaluation, and approval of all required landscape plans: 
1.  Site Planning and Design: 
(a)  The Site Plan shall consider natural drainage features to minimize runoff. The use of pervious surfaces and areas is preferred. Therefore impervious surfaces and materials within the landscaped area shall be limited to planting borders, sidewalks, stepping stones, and pedestrian seating and shall not exceed 35 percent of the landscaped area. Use of pervious paving materials is strongly encouraged even for these limited uses which will decrease the relative impervious area of the site. 
(b)  Site plans shall identify all vegetated areas to be preserved. 
(c)  All invasive exotic plant species shall be noted on the Site Plan and be removed from each site prior to the beginning of construction. For purposes of determining plant species to remove, refer to Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services "Noxious Weeds" rule Chapter 5B-57, F.A.C. and the Florida Keys Exotic Invasive Task Force rules and guidelines. 
(d)  Gravel, river rock, shell and similar materials shall not be used as a major landscape ground cover or mulch as they increase the need for herbicide use, have no habitat value, reflect rather than absorb heat, do not produce oxygen like plants and the runoff from crushed gravel results in high turbidity in near shore waters, resulting in layers of silt, which can kill off sea grass, corals and marine life. In no case may the use of these materials exceed 30 percent of the total pervious site area. 
(e)  The Landscape Construction Documents shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
i.  Location of all underground and above ground utilities and boxes including overhead utilities; 
ii.  Existing and proposed trees, shrubs, ground covers and turf areas within the developed landscape area; 
iii.  Plants by botanical and common name, where applicable cultivar name, plant spacing, quantities of plant for each type, planted sizes including notation of field grown or container size, and mature height and spread of each plant; 
iv.  Existing and proposed property lines, streets, street names and public utilities; 
v.  Existing and proposed hardscape features such as driveways, patios, and sidewalks as necessary as well as existing or proposed nonorganic mulched areas; 
vi.  Existing and proposed structures such as pools, fountains, fences and retaining walls; 
vii.  Existing and proposed buildings; 
viii.  Tabulation of the total square footage(s) of the various landscape hydrozones on the plan. If more than one (1) water meter serves the site, the total hydrozone square footages of all the various hydrozones must be identified with each Point of Connection (POC) and meter providing water service. 
(f)  Irrigation plans must be designed to recognize differential irrigation requirements of the landscape as described in this article. It is suggested that As-Built construction documents be submitted prior to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, with a copy delivered to the property owner. This will help to prevent later damage from digging by utility workers or the property owner and assist the owner with understanding the system design. The irrigation plan should show the following: 
i.  Irrigation point(s) of connection and design capacity; 
ii.  Water service pressure at irrigation POCs; 
iii.  Water meter size; 
iv.  Reduced-pressure-principle backflow-prevention devices for each irrigation POC on potable water systems; 
v.  Major components of the irrigation system shall include, but not be limited to; pumps, filters, valves, mainline pipes, lateral pipes, controllers, tubing, and pipe sizes; 
vi.  Precipitation rate expressed in inches per hour for each valve circuit. The preparer must attach to the Project Data Sheet the calculations for deriving precipitation rates for each irrigation valve circuit; 
vii.  Total flow rate (flow velocity not to exceed five (5) feet per second) in gallons per minute (gpm) and operating pressure (psi) for each individual overhead and bubbler circuit, and gallons per hour (gph) and operating pressure for low-flow point irrigation circuit; 
viii.  Irrigation legend will have the following elements: Separate symbols for all irrigation equipment. For each irrigation head type the legend shall show coverage patterns, precipitation rates, operation pressure requirements, gallons required and associated time periods, brand and model names, and pressure compensating devices (if applicable). A general description of all other equipment, including brand name and model number, sizes, special features, and materials. For all specified equipment for low-flow systems the legend shall contain recommended operating pressure, brand name and model names, precipitation rates, distribution patterns, and spacing of emitters or drip tubing; 
ix.  The same requirements for use of a recycled water irrigation system shall apply. Reclaimed water, grey water, or other nonpotable water shall be used for irrigation provided an acceptable source for that water is available and identified by the City; 
x.  Identify location of the rain shut-off devices and any soil moisture sensors; 
xi.  The irrigation system must clearly account for any slopes over ten (10%) percent and any elevation differences over five (5) feet. If the irrigation plan does not clearly show design for these situations, a grading plan may be required which shall indicate all finish grades by either spot elevations or contours or both along with drainage patterns within the developed irrigated area. 
2.  Soils: 
(a)  Analysis: When required, as determined by the City Biologist, a soil analysis shall provide the following information, at a minimum: 
i.  Determination of soil texture, indicating the percentage of organic matter; 
ii.  Measurement of pH of the soil, and total soluble salts; and 
iii.  Estimated soil infiltration rate. 
(b)  Use of Existing Top Soil: Existing horticulturally suitable topsoil shall be stockpiled and re-spread during final site grading. Any new soil required shall be similar to the existing soil in pH, texture, permeability, and other characteristics, unless a Soil Analysis provides evidence that either soil amendment is needed or a different soil type is required. The use of solid waste compost as a soil amendment is encouraged where it is appropriate. 
3.  Land Clearing Standards and Preservation of Native Vegetation: 
(a)  Unless otherwise approved by the City, clearing of a site shall preserve all native vegetation. 
(b)  Vegetation which is set aside for preservation shall be protected from all on-site construction. Protective barriers shall be installed along the perimeter of all preserve areas. Protective barriers shall be constructed at such intervals to prevent machinery from passing between them. 
(c)  No equipment or materials shall be permitted to be stored within the set-aside areas, and dumping of excess soil, liquids, or any other construction debris within the preservation areas is prohibited. 
(d)  Removal or re-grading of soils within preservation areas is prohibited. 
(e)  Any damaged vegetation within the set-aside areas shall be replaced with vegetation equivalent to the vegetation destroyed before any certificates of occupancy or other approvals may be issued. 
4.  Appropriate Plant Selection, Location, and Arrangement: 
(a)  Appropriate Plant Selection: Plant selection should be based on the plant's adaptability to the existing conditions present within the planted area and the Keys native plant communities. Plant species that are drought tolerant are preferred. For purposes of determining prohibited and controlled plant species refer to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services rule, Chapter 5B-57 Florida Administrative Code. Plants named in this rule may not be used except as allowed in Chapter 5B-57. 
(b)  Location: Plants shall be grouped in accordance with their respective water and maintenance needs. Plants with similar water and cultural (soil, climate, sun, and light) requirements shall be grouped together. The water use zones (hydrozones) shall be shown on the Irrigation, Layout, and Planting Plans (where required). Where natural conditions are such that irrigation is not required, the presence of site appropriate plants shall not be considered a high water use hydrozone. 
(c)  Arrangement: The combined size of all high water use hydrozones shall be limited to 40 percent of the total planted area including turf. In planted areas irrigated with recycled water, the allowable size of all high water use zones shall be increased to not more than 75 percent of the total planted area including turf. These high water use limits do not apply to planted areas requiring large amounts of turf for their primary functions, e.g., ballfields and playgrounds. 
5.  Turf Areas: 
(a)  Type and Location: The type of turf shall be selected from Table 107.69.1, below and the location of turf areas shall be chosen in the same manner as with all the other plantings. Irrigated turf areas, as opposed to non-irrigated turf areas, are considered to be a high water use hydrozone. Irrigated turf shall not be treated as a fill-in material but rather as a planned element of the landscape. Turf shall be placed so that it can be irrigated using separate zones. 
Table 107.69.1
Turf Types 
Appropriate for the Keys 
St. Augustine Bermuda Zoysia Bahia  
(b)  Arrangement: While turf areas provide many practical benefits in a landscape, how and where it is used can result in a significant reduction in water use. Irrigated turf grass areas shall be consolidated and limited to those areas on the site that receive pedestrian traffic, provide for recreation use, provide cover for waste treatment drainfields and required drainfield reserve areas, or provide soil erosion control such as on slopes or in swales; and where turfgrass is used as a design unifier, or other similar practical use. No turf grass that requires mowing shall be allowed on slopes greater than 4:1 or within six (6) feet of the water's edge, except where adjacent to seawalls and bulkheads or where needed to control erosion. For turf areas (where a planting plan is required) areas shall be identified on the plan by biological and common name and by variety and by the square footage covered by the turf. 
6.  Efficient Irrigation: 
(a)  Design Guidelines: An irrigation system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Site Planning and Design Requirements of this Article. 
(b)  Irrigation Schedule: Water can be conserved through the use of a properly designed, managed, maintained, and timed irrigation system. Irrigation scheduling information, equipment manuals, and instructions for seasonal, daily and weekly timing (as appropriate), and proper sensor settings, shall be provided to the owner at the time of installation by the irrigation contractor. An irrigation valve location map, gallons per minute demands, precipitation rates, plant types within valve circuits, and operating pressure requirements for each valve shall be developed and provided to the property owner. This map shall be attached inside each irrigation controller, pump station, or be kept in another readily available location as is practical and maintained as a permanent record for the irrigation system. 
(c)  Arrangement: The irrigation system shall be designed to correlate to the organization of plants into zones as described in this Article. The water use zones shall be shown on the Irrigation Plan (where plan is required). All plants (including turf) require watering during plant establishment. Temporary irrigation systems may be installed to facilitate establishment of plants and turf. 
(d)  Rain Water Collection: The City encourages the installation of rainwater catchment systems such as cisterns or rain barrels to reduce dependency on the use of potable water for outdoor irrigation. 
7.  Other Requirements: 
(a)  Moisture Sensing Equipment: Moisture sensing equipment shall be required on automatic irrigation systems to avoid irrigation during periods of sufficient rainfall and/or soil moisture. Rain shut-off switch equipment shall be required on all new irrigation systems and any systems that are significantly modified or repaired. Said equipment shall consist of an automatic mechanical or electronic sensing device or switch that will override the irrigation controller the irrigation system when adequate rainfall has occurred. 
(b)  Protection of Lines: The installation of tracer wire along main lines and laterals is strongly encouraged to permit easy location and prevent inadvertent cutting of pipes. 
(c)  Check Valves: Check valves may be required to be installed in irrigation heads prevent low head drainage and puddling, when the head exceeds eight (8) feet above the POC. 
(d)  Precipitation Rate: Nozzle precipitation rates for all heads within each valve circuit must be matched. 
(e)  Pressure Regulating Valves: A pressure-regulating valve shall be installed and maintained if static service pressure for the irrigation system is too excessive to allow for valves or heads to operate within the manufacturer's recommendations for that equipment. [ Rationale:The purpose of this requirement is twofold, to protect against system failure during pressure surges, and to avoid wasted water due to operation of the system significantly above commonly used design values.] 
8.  Yard Waste Management, Composting and Use of Mulches: 
(a)  Yard Waste Management: Yard wastes shall not be disposed of or stored by shorelines, in ditches or swales, or near storm drains. [ Rationale:Yard wastes release nutrients as they decompose which may pollute the receiving water. Improper disposal of yard wastes can also contribute to flooding by causing stormwater runoff to backup in drainage systems. In addition, improper disposal may lead to spreading of invasive plants to new areas.] 
(b)  Composting: Shredded yard clippings and leaves should be used for mulch or be composted for use as fertilizer. Diseased organic material should not be stored, composted or used as mulch and should be properly disposed of to avoid spreading disease. 
(c)  Use of Mulches: 
i.  Composting of organic yard wastes provide many benefits and their use is strongly encouraged. The resulting materials are excellent soil amendments and conditioners. Other recycled organic solid waste products are also available and should be used when appropriate. 
ii.  Grass clippings are a benefit to lawns by replacing nutrients drawn from the soil and as mulch that helps retain moisture lessening the need to irrigate. Grass clippings should be left on the lawn. Mulching mowers are recommended, because the grass clippings are chopped very finely by special blade and shroud configurations. 
iii.  If a conventional mower equipped with a side discharge chute is used, the following practices should be employed. When mowing near the shoreline, direct the chute away from the waterbody. When mowing upland areas, direct the chute back onto the yard, not onto the road or driveway. 
iv.  Other mulches (except grass clippings) can be applied and maintained at appropriate depths in planting beds to assist soils in retaining moisture, reducing weed growth, and preventing erosion. These mulches can also be used in places where conditions aren't adequate for or conducive to growing quality turf or ground covers. Mulches are typically wood bark chips, wood grindings, pine straws, nut shells, and shredded landscape clippings. 
v.  A layer of organic mulch three (3) inches deep shall be specified on the planting plans in plant beds and around individual trees in turfgrass areas. Use of a byproduct or recycled mulch is recommended. Mulch is not required in annual beds. 
vi.  Mulch rings should extend to at least three (3) feet around freestanding trees and shrubs. 
vii.  All mulch should be renewed periodically. 
viii.  Mulches should be kept at least six (6) inches away from any portion of a building or structure. Mulches should be kept two to four (2-4) inches away from all tree trunks and certain types of shrubs and ground covers. 
ix.  Plastic or other impervious materials shall not be used under mulched areas. 
9.  Installation and Maintenance: All planting, excluding private residences, shall be installed according to accepted commercial planting procedures and executed by a qualified and licensed landscape contractor using the quality and type of materials recommended by the City Biologist and stated herein. 
10.  Exemptions to Xeriscaping: Exempted from the provisions of this Article, if applicable, are the following: 
(a)  Golf courses and specialized athletic fields; [ Rationale:These have specialized needs not addressed in the general references, and are usually managed by highly trained professionals] 
(b)  One and two-family dwelling units on individual lots. 
(c)  Any development that is governed by an approved, final site plan or a valid building permit issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, is exempted from retrofitting or meeting the specific provisions of this Article. However, no existing development is exempted from meeting the provisions affecting management, maintenance, or the education of maintenance personnel of this Ordinance. 
(d)  Rights-of-way for public utilities, including electrical transmission and distribution lines, and natural gas pipelines. 
(e)  Conditional exemption may be granted by the City Biologist for individual projects if the applicant can, in writing, define the areas of exemption and demonstrate acceptable reasons for the requested exemption. 
11.  Alternative Compliance: 
(a)  An applicant may submit a landscape or planting plan which varies from the strict application of the xeriscaping requirements of this Article in order to accommodate unique site features, or characteristics, the preservation of water views or to utilize innovative design. 
(b)  An alternative compliance landscape or planting plan may be approved only upon a finding that it fulfills the purpose and intent of the xeriscaping requirements of the Plan and of this Article as well as or more effectively than would adherence to the strict requirements. 
(c)  In evaluating proposed alternative compliance landscape or planting plans, considerations shall be given to proposals which preserve existing native vegetation and where the design ensures the maximum preservation of existing non-invasive vegetation on the site. 
Section 107.70. - Landscape Buffer Requirements. 
A.  Project Boundary Buffers: 
1.  General Provisions:

(c)  The required planting shall generally be spaced or grouped to provide a natural appearance. The required planting shall be evenly spaced to provide a natural appearance. 
(d)  The plant materials specified in Table 107.70.2 is the minimum materials required per 100 linear feet of buffer; the total quantity of materials required shall be determined by dividing the actual length of the buffer. 
(e)  Canopy trees shall be planted no closer than four (4) feet from any property line. 
(f)  Shrubs shall be selected that provide a variety of heights at maturity. 
(g)  Where screening is required or proposed in conjunction with a project boundary buffer (side and rear buffers) as indicated in Table 107.70.1, it shall consist of one (1) of the following: 
i.  A six-foot tall masonry wall; 
ii.  A six-foot tall opaque fence, such as vinyl or wood (no chain-link); 
iii.  Existing dense vegetation not invasive, at least six (6) feet in height; or 
iv.  A berm three (3) feet in height, located entirely within the dense buffer and planted with materials that at maturity shall reach a combined minimum height of six (6) feet. 
(h)  The location of the wall, fence or berm within the buffer strip shall be subject to TRC determination. 
(i)  Pedestrian connections through walls or fences that can provide access to adjacent neighborhoods or other uses are encouraged. 
(j)  Walls and fences shall be landscaped along the entire exterior side so that one-third ( 1/3 ) or more of the vertical face of the fence or wall is screened by plantings. The applicant shall be required to demonstrate provision for access and maintenance of landscaping at the time of landscape or planting approval. 
(k)  Walls and fences more than 60 feet long shall have varying wall alignments, use appropriate scale/massing for planted materials, and include decorative features and sound absorbing or scattering materials. 
(l)  When a berm is used to form a visual screen in lieu of or in conjunction with a hedge or wall, such berm shall have a stabilized slope of one to three (1:3) rise/run and shall be completely covered with shrubs, sod or other landscape quality living ground cover. 
(m)  Existing non-invasive vegetation may be used to fulfill buffering and screening requirements where such existing natural vegetation is of sufficient height or can be augmented to reach a sufficient height and opacity to provide an effective visual and acoustical buffer giving consideration to the existing and proposed uses. 
    Roadway Buffers: Specific roadway buffers shall be required as established in Section 107.71, "Streetscape Treatment Types" below. Any vegetation planted near driveways and road intersections shall be selected so that the requirements in Article 5, Section 107.43 for clear sight triangle can be met. 
B.  Measurements: 
1.  Driveway widths (measured at the inside edge of the buffer) shall not be counted in the calculation of the plant material required. 
2.  All buffers shall be measured from the future right-of-way line determined during the site plan review, unless additional public utility easement is required between the right-of-way line and the buffer to provide utility clearance. 
Section 107.71. - Streetscape Treatment Types. 
    Streetscape treatments encompass the organization of outdoor space and all elements creating that space, including trees and vegetation, parking areas, hardscape structures such as fences, walls, furniture, and sidewalks, and the correct orientation and proper scale of building facades. Streetscape treatment shall be applied to the front setback, in particular those fronting a street or road. 
    The following streetscape treatment types shall apply throughout the City: 
A.  Type 1: (A, MU, MU-M, P, PR zoning districts): It is the expressed intent of Streetscape Treatment Type 1 to provide an environment which mitigates the impacts of automobile-oriented areas in order to make them more livable. This includes reduction of visual clutter, including signage and location of auto parking areas, and the provision of landscaping to enhance and soften the environment through the provision of screening, shade, and buffers. It shall apply to all parcels along US 1, with the exception of the Old Town area. 
1.  The landscape treatment area shall be planted within a ten-foot wide buffer predominantly with shrubs and native canopy trees of at least two (2) inches caliper at breast height, approximately 50 feet on center. 
2.  A minimum of four (4) understory trees per 240 feet of frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be planted in and about access points. In addition smaller accent trees shall be planted every 120 feet and staggered midway between the large canopy trees. 
3.  Canopy and understory trees shall be placed so as to provide at least 50 percent canopy coverage of sidewalks along US1, except where prohibited by overhead utility restrictions or as required to preserve the water view when traveling along the highway. 
4.  Plantings within utility easements shall be consistent with any such easement agreement dictating type and height of such plantings at maturity. Plantings of shrubs and small trees may be located within the utility easement upon agreement and approval of FKAA and FKEC only. When the utility easement is narrow, the plantings shall be placed on the road side of the easement. In such instances the planting area shall be a minimum width of five (5) feet between the back of the curb and the sidewalk, in accordance with the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, latest edition, incorporated in Rule 14-15.002, F.A.C. 
5.  Parking spaces shall not be placed on the front of parking lots abutting US1. 
6.  All parking not located to the rear of buildings shall be screened from the right-of-way by a landscaped buffer along US1, including a continuous hedge or combination hedge and earth berm providing a three-foot high visual screen within two (2) years of planting. 
7.  Parcels which propose drive-thru windows shall be sited so as to locate such windows to the side or rear of buildings and that the drive isles for those windows be predominantly to the side and rear also. 
B.  Type 2: (MU, MU-M): Detailed design of the streetscape shall be accomplished in concert with the architectural design, specific use standards, streetscape design, and special parking requirements. It shall be applied to the Old Town area along US 1 only. 
1.  Parking Standards: 
(a)  Parking lots shall be located at the rear or side of street-front uses and shall be screened from the streets, sidewalk, and open spaces by low walls, fences, or low berms in combination with plantings to achieve at least a three-foot high visual screen. Walls or fences must be softened through use of vegetation. 
(b)  Parking lots and parking garages shall not abut street intersections, be adjacent to squares or parks, or occupy lots that terminate at a vista, except when specifically designed to incorporate massing, scale, and detail that contributes to the adjoining public space. 
(c)  Adjacent parking lots shall have vehicular connections and shared street access wherever possible. 
2.  Land Use Standards: 
(a)  All open spaces, including public, conservation, and community spaces, shall be a focal element around which other land uses are organized. 
(b)  Provisions for alternative transportation shall be included in the overall design including specific accommodations for integration of mass transit facilities. 
(c)  Development shall be divided into an interconnected grid system. 
(d)  Appropriate locations for all pedestrian/bicycle access ways shall encourage a continuous system of access. Proposed pedestrian/bicycle access shall connect to existing pedestrian/bicycle access in appropriate manner. 
3.  Required Tree Plantings: 
(a)  Native canopy street trees shall be required along both sides of US1. Spacing is determined by species type. Unless the planting of the canopy tree will interfere with the water views when traveling along US1, street trees shall be spaced an average of 40 feet on center. Examples of appropriate canopy trees are identified in Table 107.68.1. 
(b)  All planting shall be coordinated with existing and planned utilities and their infrastructure in such a way as to not interfere with those utilities. 
(c)  Street trees shall be planted between the street and the sidewalk whenever space permits to protect pedestrians and calm traffic. In such instances the planting area shall be a minimum width of five (5) feet between the back of the curb and the sidewalk, in accordance with the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, latest edition, incorporated in Rule 14-15.002, F.A.C. 
C.  Street Treatment Type 3: (All zoning districts on other City streets): 
1.  All multi-family and nonresidential developments shall be required to provide one (1) of the following buffers along the entire street frontage: 
(a)  Two (2) canopy trees and two (2) understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a ten-foot wide landscape buffer. Spacing of canopy trees will be determined by species, but in no case shall they be planted further than 40 feet on center. Examples of appropriate canopy trees are identified in Table 107.68.1. 
(b)  Under utility lines only, four (4) understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a ten-foot wide landscape buffer. 
2.  All single- and two-family residential uses shall be required to provide a minimum of two (2) canopy street trees for every 100 linear feet of property frontage along local streets. Spacing will be determined by species, but in no case shall they be planted further than 50 feet on center. Examples of appropriate canopy trees are identified in Table 107.68.1. 
3.  Utility allocations shall be designed to provide utilities' required separation between trees and utility facilities. 
4.  Street trees shall be planted between the street and the sidewalk whenever space permits to protect pedestrians and calm traffic. In such instances the planting area shall be a minimum width of five (5) feet between the back of the curb and the sidewalk, in accordance with the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, latest edition, incorporated in Rule 14-15.002, F.A.C. 
5.  For streets without curbing, all street trees shall be planted no further than ten (10) feet from the back of right-of-way. 
Section 107.72. - Alternative Compliance. 
(d)[(a)]  The provisions of this article shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out the purpose and the intent of the Plan and of this article in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City. 
(e)[(b)]  An applicant may submit a landscape or planting plan which varies from the strict application of the requirements of this article in order to accommodate unique site features, or characteristics, the preservation of water views or to utilize innovative design. 
(f)[(c)]  An alternative compliance landscape or planting plan may be approved only upon a finding that it fulfills the purpose and intent of the Plan and of this article as well as or more effectively than would adherence to the strict requirements. 
(g)[(d)]  In evaluating proposed alternative compliance landscape or planting plans, considerations shall be given to proposals which preserve existing native vegetation and use xeriscape and other low water use landscape design principles and where the design ensures the maximum preservation of existing vegetation on the site. 
ARTICLE 9. - OPEN SPACE 

Section 107.73. - Purpose. 
    This article implements the open space policies contained in the Future Land Use, and the Conservation and Coastal Elements of the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan and provides for open space areas designed to protect and enhance natural resources, promote pedestrian connectivity and enhance recreational opportunities. 
Section 107.74. - Minimum Open Space Requirement. 
    Open space shall be provided on at least 20 percent of a development and shall be delineated on all site plans and plats. Within environmentally sensitive parcels, as described in Chapter 106 "Natural and Historic Resource Protection", open space shall be provided pursuant to the zoning of the parcel and is subject to the open space requirements of Table 106.16.1 "Open Space Requirements by Habitat Type". 
Section 107.75. - Primary Open Space Areas. 
    When land development involves a parcel that contains any of the conservation areas listed in subsection A., the open space requirements shall first be fulfilled with these areas and the required buffers. When the minimum requirement is not fulfilled with conservation areas, the requirements shall then be fulfilled with Natural Areas as listed in Subsection B. 
A.  Conservation Areas and Associated Buffers: 
1.  Wetlands; 
2.  Surface waters within private ownership; 
3.  Listed species habitat. 
B.  Natural Areas: Native habitat or areas that potentially could be utilized to enhance or restore natural features on or adjacent to the development site. This open space shall be useable to the extent consistent with the character and protection of the resource. 
Section 107.76. - Secondary Open Space Areas. 
    After conservation areas and associated buffers and other natural areas have been set aside as open space, any remaining required open space may then be fulfilled with the qualifying areas listed in this article, based upon the type of development. 
A.  Residential Developments: Within residential developments, the following areas shall be credited toward open space requirements: 
1.  Community Green Spaces: Pervious open spaces designed as active or passive recreation areas intended primarily for recreational or pedestrian use, such as community fields, greens, and pervious areas of plazas or squares. Pedestrian amenities and other minor structures that enhance the open space may be permitted within these qualifying open space areas. 
2.  Pedestrian Trails: Paved or mulched pedestrian trails located within a qualifying open space may be counted towards the required open space area. 
3.  Stormwater Management Areas: Stormwater management areas that are designed consistent with Section 107.78, "Requirements for Stormwater Management Areas used as Open Space" and Section 107.79, "Access to Open Space" may be considered as credit for up to one-half (1/2) of the required open space. 
B.  Nonresidential Developments: Within nonresidential developments, the following areas shall be credited toward open space requirements: 
1.  Community Green Spaces: Pervious open spaces designed as active or passive recreation areas intended primarily for recreational or pedestrian use, such as community fields, greens, and pervious areas of plazas or squares. Pedestrian amenities and other minor structures that enhance the open space may be permitted within these qualifying open space areas. 
2.  Landscaped areas: Landscaped areas with a minimum area of 500 square feet and a minimum width of 20 feet containing native species canopy and understory trees, shrubs, and groundcovers consistent with xeriscape principles. 
3.  Stormwater Management Areas: All portions of stormwater management areas that are designed consistent with Section 107.78, "Requirements for Stormwater Management Areas used as Open Space" and Section 107.79, "Access to Open Space" may be considered as credit for the required open space. 
C.  Quality Mixed-Use Developments: All Community Green Spaces, Pedestrian Trails, Landscaped Areas as described above, as well as buffers, squares, parks, plazas, and all portions of stormwater management areas that are designed consistent with Section 107.78, "Requirements for Stormwater Management Areas used as Open Space" and Section 107.79, "Access to Open Space" shall be credited toward the required open space. 
Section 107.77. - Designation of Open Space Areas. 
A.  Prior to submitting a site plan or as part of the concept meeting, when applicable, an applicant shall consult with staff to identify the most appropriate portion of the development site to be designated as open space. 
B.  In addition to the specific standards and priorities set forth in this article, the following goals shall guide the designation of open space: 
1.  Open space areas shall be useable and contiguous to the extent consistent with the character and protection of the resource. 
2.  Open spaces should be contiguous to greenways, trails, public parks, or other open spaces on adjoining parcels in order to promote the creation of larger open spaces with greater usability, resource protection, and connectivity. 
Section 107.78. - Requirements for Stormwater Management Areas Used as Open Space. 
    Stormwater management systems shall be designed in accordance with Article 11 "Stormwater Management" of this Chapter and must complement and be integrated with the other required open space areas. In addition to the design requirements of Article 11 for stormwater management areas, the following criteria shall apply in order to be considered as credit toward the open space requirement: 
A.  Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to provide a greater biological diversity, enhanced stormwater treatment, and a variety of hydrologic conditions by incorporating the following design features: 
1.  Provide staged elevations within the treatment volume of the basin. The initial tier, or forbay, should be designed to capture the majority of the sediments. Additionally, baffles, islands, berms, channels and other similar measures may be incorporated to maximize the contact of the stormwater with the surfaces of the basin. 
2.  At a minimum, one (1) tree shall be planted for every 50 linear feet, or fraction of, of basin perimeter. Within the basin bottom, a variety of native trees shall be provided at an average of one (1) tree every 50 feet on center. Spacing of trees may be closer when trees are planted in groups. Certified apparently weed free sod shall be used. 
B.  Retention/detention basins are encouraged to be designed with irregular shorelines to increase the overall length of shoreline. 
C.  A five-foot wide maintained pedestrian path shall be provided around the perimeter of the basin and be connected to pedestrian paths in other open spaces. No clearing, mowing or removal of native, non-invasive vegetation shall take place interior to this path. As an alternative, a designed landscape plan may be approved by the TRC that would provide greater or equal biological diversity and enhanced stormwater treatment. 
D.  Stormwater facilities designated as open space shall be managed to maintain no invasive non-native plants. 
Section 107.79. - Access to Open Space. 
A.  Required open space shall be accessible from the development. Access to the open space areas shall be provided in the form of pedestrian paths that connect the open space to the transportation network, the mowed path around stormwater facilities, and open spaces on adjacent developments. These pedestrian paths shall be shown clearly on the site plan, maintained, and marked formally at entrances with explanatory signs describing their function and purpose. 
B.  For purposes of this section, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether the open space is useable and accessible: 
1.  Areas useable for passive recreation such as walking, picnicking, wildlife viewing and similar activities shall be considered accessible for purposes of this requirement; 
2.  Wet and natural areas that are not directly or easily accessible may be considered to meet the requirements of this Section if they can be viewed easily from adjacent land areas that are also part of the stormwater or open space system; 
3.  A periodic lack of public access due to significant rainfall shall not disqualify such areas from counting toward the required open space percentage. 
C.  Basins that require fencing, as defined in Chapter 110, shall not be counted toward the required open space for a development. For basins that do not require fencing, decorative fencing may be added as an aesthetic feature, provided that it does not preclude access to the open space. 
Section 107.80. - Protection and Maintenance of Open Space Areas. 
A.  All open space areas shall be maintained and remain undeveloped. 
B.  All open space areas shall be defined in detail on the site plan and delineated on plats. It shall be a condition of all development approval that such open spaces shall remain as shown on the site plan or plat, shall remain useable and accessible as required by this article, and shall be maintained accordingly. Any failure to abide by this condition shall be deemed a violation of the site plan or plat. 
C.  All conservation areas including those that contribute towards the required open space shall be identified and protected in accordance with Article 8 "Conservation Management Areas", Chapter 106 of the LDRs. 
D.  Where deemed necessary to ensure the protection or accessibility of the required open space, the approval of the development may be conditioned on the open space being protected by easements, restrictive covenants, or other legally enforceable instruments that run with the land. All such restrictions shall be recorded in the public records of Monroe County. 
E.  A responsible entity, which may include the owner, a property owner's association, the City, another public agency or a nonprofit organization, shall be designated to be responsible for maintaining the open space in a manner that is consistent with all applicable City requirements and the purpose for which it was created. 
F.  Any conditions necessary for stormwater facilities to meet open space requirements shall be incorporated into the stormwater maintenance plan. The responsible entity is required to inform the acting maintenance contractors of these conditions. 
Section 107.81. - Alternative Compliance. 
A.  The provisions of this article shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out the purpose and the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and of this article in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City. 
B.  An applicant may submit an open space plan which varies from the strict application of the requirements of this article in order to accommodate unique site features or characteristics, to provide specialized open space amenities, or to take advantage of innovative design. In no event, however, shall there be variation from the requirement to provide a minimum of 20 percent of the development site as open space area. 
C.  An alternative compliance open space plan may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Director, only upon a finding that it fulfills the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and of this article as well as or more effectively than would adherence to the strict requirements. 
D.  In evaluating proposed alternative compliance landscape or planting plans, considerations shall be given to proposals which preserve native vegetation and use xeriscape and other low water use landscape design principles and where the design ensures preservation of the maximum existing vegetation on the site.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-05 , § 2, adopted August 14, 2018, repealed the former Article 12, §§ 107.98-107.102.5, and enacted a new Article 12 as set out herein. The former Article 12 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2012-01, § 3, adopted January 24, 2012. 

Section 107.98. - General. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Marathon, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
B.  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
C.  Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
D.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
E.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
G.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the Planning Commission that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

ARTICLE 13. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT 

Section 107.103. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purposes of this article are to implement the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan's adopted level of service standards for roads, potable water, sanitary sewer, parks, solid waste, and stormwater management. 
Section 107.104. - Requirements for Concurrency. 
    No final development order shall be approved, except for the development that is defined as exempt or vested pursuant to this chapter, unless it is determined that the necessary public facilities will be available concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. The burden of meeting this concurrency requirement will be on the applicant requesting a final development order. No Certificate of Occupancy will be granted until all facilities and services, including stormwater, are in place and it is demonstrated that roadway levels of service are not degraded below adopted LOS. The criteria for determining whether the public facilities affected by the development will be available based on the level of service standards adopted for each public facility are as follows: 
A.  Potable water, Sanitary Sewer, Solid Waste, Roads and Stormwater Management Facilities: 
1.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued; 
2.  A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur; 
3.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a development permit is issued and will be in place when the impacts of development occur; or 
4.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement that includes the provisions in Subsections 1., 2. or 3. above. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to: (1) development agreements pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 163.3220; or (2) an agreement or development order issued pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 380. Any such agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of development occur. 
B.  Parks and Recreational Facilities: In addition to meeting one (1) of the criteria defined under Subsection A., above, the requirement for concurrency may be met if: 
1.  At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract which provides for the commencement of actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services within one (1) year of the issuance of the development permit; 
2.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires commencement of construction of the facilities within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development permit. Such enforceable development agreements may include, but are not limited to; development agreements pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 380; or 
3.  The payment of fees in lieu of dedication of land, to be used for the acquisition of lands for parks, conservation or open space, in a amount determined by the City. However, the facilities to correct the deficiency in LOS must be in place or under construction not more than one (1) year after the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy; and the improvement is included in the Capital Improvement Schedule; or that such an improvement is required through an enforceable development. 
Table 107.104.1 
Level of Service Standards Facilities Level of Service Standards Wastewater The City, shall at a minimum, adopt the current level of service standards as provided in federal and state regulations. The current LOS standards are as follows: 
Florida Statutory Treatment Standards in MG/L: BOD-TSS-TN-TP 
 1. On-Site Systems (BAT) Community Wastewater Collection and Treatment Systems in MG/L: 10-10-10-1 
 2. Design flows less than or equal to 100,000 gpd (BAT) in MG/L: 10-10-10-1

Overall LOS: 100 gallons/capita/day. Solid Waste Residential Disposal Quantity: 5.44 pounds/capita/day 
Nonresidential: 6.37 pounds/acre/day. Surface Water  1. Post development runoff shall not exceed the predevelopment runoff rate for a 25-year storm event, up to and including an event with a 24-hour duration. 
 2. Surface water treatment and disposal facilities shall be designed to meet the design and performance standards established in Chapter 17-25, Section 25.025, FAC, with treatment of the runoff from the first one (1) inch of rainfall on-site to meet the water quality standards required by Chapter 17-302, Section 17-302.500, FAC. 
 3. Surface water facilities which directly discharge into 'Outstanding Florida Waters' (OFW) shall provide an additional treatment pursuant to Section 17-25.025 (9), FAC. Surface water facilities must be designed so as to not degrade the receiving water body below the minimum conditions necessary to assure the suitability of water for the designated use of its classification as established in Chapter 17-302, FAC. Recreation and Open Space 4.42 acres per 1,000 population. Roadways U.S. 1 shall be maintained within five (5%) of LOS C 
Other roadways shall be maintained within five (5%) of LOS D.  
Section 107.105. - Information and Methodology. 
A.  The information and methodology to be used by the City as the basis for concurrency determinations are as follows: 
1.  The maximum service volume of each public facility affected by the proposed development based on the adopted level of service standards. 
2.  The existing demand on each public facility affected by the proposed development. 
3.  Any reservation of capacity on each affected public facility for approved development. 
4.  Proposed development impacts (the projected or estimated portion of the capacity of the affected public facility to be used by the proposed development). 
B.  The necessary public facilities will be deemed available concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development if the sum of proposed development impacts when added to the existing demand and the capacity reservation is less than the maximum service volume on the affected facilities. 
C.  For the purposes of making concurrency determinations, affected roadway segments are all those wholly or partially located within one-half (1/2) mile of the project's entrances/exits, or to the nearest intersecting major street, whichever is greater. 
Section 107.106. - Preliminary Certificate of Level of Service Compliance. 
A.  An applicant must apply for a preliminary Certificate of Level of Service Compliance (CLSC) no later than the time of application for preliminary site plan approval. The preliminary application for CLSC shall be submitted with an application for preliminary site plan approval. The applicant shall submit, with the preliminary application: 
1.  Documentation supporting any assertion of de minimis impact (minimal). 
2.  If the applicant is not asserting de minimis impacts, the appropriate traffic documentation including impacts to affected roadway facilities as defined in Section 107.104 shall be included in the application. 
B.  The City will review the application and supporting traffic documentation for completeness and correctness within the timeframes of the applicable TRC cycle in order to ensure that the information submitted is sufficient to accept the application and continue its review. If the application is determined to be incomplete or incorrect, the applicant will be notified within the applicable TRC review period and advised of the deficiencies required to be addressed in a new or revised application. 
C.  If the application is determined to be complete, an assessment of whether the concurrency requirements are met for each public facility affected by the proposed development will be provided by the TRC with its review of the preliminary site plan. 
D.  Based on this assessment by TRC, the Director will issue a preliminary CLSC determination within five (5) working days of TRC action on the preliminary site plan. The preliminary CLSC determination will indicate if the proposed developments' impacts are considered de minimis impacts or if the requirements for concurrency will be met, subject to any limitations indicated by the public facility provider, based on the preliminary site plan. 
E.  The CLSC will also indicate any additional information or items that are required to be submitted with final plan application. Projects determined to have de minimis impacts shall not be required to meet roadway concurrency requirements, or if the requirements will not be met based on the preliminary site plan, the preliminary CLSC will indicate what deficiencies will have to be addressed in the final site plan in order for a final CLSC to be issued. A preliminary CLSC is valid for 180 days from the date of assessment by the TRC. If there are changes to a proposed development's timing, the proposed density or intensity increases, or if the preliminary CLSC expires, then an amended CLSC must be obtained through the appropriate TRC process. An amended preliminary CLSC is valid for 180 days from the date of reassessment by the TRC. 
Section 107.107. - Concurrency Reservations. 
A.  Mixed-use Development: For projects associated with a mixed-use development (MUD) the preliminary CLSC may be issued for time periods established by the phasing schedule associated with an approved preliminary site plan. The phasing schedule shall specify, as a percentage, that portion of the project that will be completed at the end of each calendar year. The applicant shall demonstrate that LOS standards can be met for each of the time frames established with the approved preliminary site plan. In no instance, may the CLSC for a MUD be valid for greater than a ten-year time frame. 
B.  Affordable Housing Developments: For affordable housing developments, as defined in Chapter 110 of the LDRs, the preliminary CLSC may be issued for time periods established by the phasing schedule associated with an approved preliminary site plan. The applicant shall demonstrate that LOS standards can be met for the each of the time frames established with the approved preliminary site plan. In no instance, may the CLSC for an affordable housing project be valid for greater than a five-year time frame. 
Section 107.108. - Final Certificate of Level of Service Compliance. 
A.  The preliminary CLSC determination issued by the Director may be submitted with an application for final development order or plat approval as the basis for a final CLSC which shall be issued by the Director provided all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The final development order is submitted and determined to be complete by the TRC prior to the expiration date of a valid preliminary CLSC; 
2.  Any conditions identified in the preliminary CLSC are adequately addressed and are contained in the final development order application; 
3.  The intensities and densities requested for the final development order approval do not exceed those approved for the preliminary plan, unless the applicant has applied for and been issued an amended preliminary CLSC addressing the impacts of the increased densities or intensities requested and finding that adequate capacity will be available for each affected public facility. In order to obtain an amended preliminary CLSC, the applicant must submit the proposed increases in densities or intensities and relevant information to the TRC for an amended preliminary CLSC to be issued. The amended preliminary CLSC approval must be obtained by the applicant prior to application for final approval by the TRC. If the TRC determines that revised preliminary review is not required, an amended preliminary CLSC is not required for final development order approval; 
4.  The final CLSC shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from date of issuance by the TRC, unless otherwise specified for a phased MUD or affordable housing after which it shall be void unless construction has commenced prior to expiration of the one-year period, or other period specified for a phased MUD or affordable housing project, or an extension of no more than one (1) year has been granted by the Director for "good cause" (as defined in Chapter 110) shown by the applicant. Any such extension will be issued only if no imminent or existing public facility deficiencies exist at the time of the application for extension; and 
5.  Denial of an extension by the Director may be appealed in accordance with the LDRs. Provided that construction has commenced within the allowable period, the project shall have reserved capacity for a period of no more than two (2) years from commencement of construction. After that two-year period, or any period otherwise specified in the final CLSC, the public facility capacity required to accommodate the impacts of the un-constructed portions of the development may be made available to other proposed developments applying for CLSCs. Allocation of this capacity will be based on a management plan approved by the City Council to address any deficiencies or imminent deficiencies identified in the annual concurrency status report prepared pursuant to the Plan. 
Section 107.109. - Development Orders Requiring Certificate. 
    The following development orders and permits are subject to a determination that the proposed development will not cause levels of service to fall below the City's adopted standards for roads, potable water, sanitary sewer, stormwater management, parks, and solid waste: 
A.  An application for a final development order issued by the Council, where the proposed final development order would authorize any change in the density, intensity, location, land uses, capacity, size, or other aspects of the proposed development that could be expected to result in additional impacts on public facilities; or 
B.  Other permits for developments which do not undergo review by the TRC, which will affect one (1) or more of the public facilities that are subject to concurrency. Concurrency determinations for such permits will be limited to those public facilities which the TRC or Public Works Department determines will be impacted by the proposed activity. 
Section 107.110. - Exemptions from Requirement for Certificate. 
    Issuance of the following development approval shall be exempt from the requirements for obtaining a determination of capacity and a certificate of level of service compliance: 
A.  Projects determined to be vested from pertinent concurrency requirements pursuant to Chapter 102 Article 19, "Vested Rights"; 
B.  A demolition permit; 
C.  A permit for a temporary use; 
D.  Individual single-family or duplex residences and accessory building permits on existing lots of record. Although exempt from the requirement to apply for a CLCS of this article, the Director shall conduct a determination of capacity prior to administrative approval to assure the necessary public facilities and services are available; 
E.  A facility which by state or federal law is not subject to the concurrency requirements of local land development regulations; 
F.  Additions to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
G.  Ancillary facilities to existing residential structures including pools, screen enclosures, and utility sheds; and 
H.  Permits to bring existing structures into code compliance, including re-roofs. 
Section 107.111. - Denial of Certificate. 
    If it is determined that the requirements for concurrency cannot be met for any public facility impacted for a proposed development, an initial CLSC denial notice identifying the facilities that were determined not to be concurrent, the level of service deficiency and the impact assessment that was the basis for that determination will be issued by the concurrency management official and provided to the applicant. 
A.  Request for Reconsideration: Upon receipt of an initial CLSC denial notice, the applicant may submit a request for reconsideration of initial CLSC denial to the Director with a proposed alternative impact assessment demonstrating that impacts will not violate concurrency management requirements. Any such request for reconsideration and the accompanying documentation shall be submitted within 45 working days of the issuance of the initial CLSC denial notice and reviewed by the concurrency management official and approved or denied within 45 working days of the receipt of the request for reconsideration. 
B.  Proposal to Address Denial: Upon receipt of an initial CLSC denial notice, the applicant may submit a proposal to address an initial CLSC denial to the concurrency management official. Such proposal will identify proposed options to remedy the deficiency or deficiencies identified by the City as the basis for the initial CLSC denial. These options may include: 
1.  Modification of the density, intensity, or timing of the proposed development with identification of how the modifications will remedy the deficiency that was the basis for the initial CLSC denial; 
2.  Measures to mitigate the deficiency, including an action plan to reduce the impacts of the proposed development on the affected public facilities that were determined not to be concurrent; such action plans may include special demand management measures to be incorporated as conditions of the final development order; or 
3.  Proposed improvements to the affected public facility that will be sufficient to offset the impacts of the proposed development resulting in the failure to meet concurrency. Such improvements may be included by the applicant as part of a development agreement or proposed as an amendment to the comprehensive plan in the form of projects to be included in the capital improvement program of the comprehensive plan or amendments to adopted level of service standards; 
C.  Response to Proposal: The Director shall respond to the proposal within 45 working days of receipt with an indication of whether the proposal, if implemented, would allow the proposed development to meet the concurrency requirement. If the proposal would require further action by the TRC or by the City Council, the applicant will be informed of the process to be followed to apply for such approval. In addition, the Director shall provide information on CLSC denials and proposals to address denials in the annual concurrency status report. 
Section 107.112. - Appeals. 
    Any person with legal standing who wishes to challenge a final CLSC may do so in accordance with the procedures outlined in Chapter 102 Article 17, "Appeals". 
Section 107.113. - Enforcement. 
    A violation of this Chapter shall be a misdemeanor punishable according to law; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City shall have the power to sue in civil court to enforce the provisions of this Chapter. Violations of this Chapter may also be referred to the City of Marathon Code Compliance Board for enforcement in accordance with Fla.

4.  Design profile along the centerline of the driveway; 
5.  Typical cross section of the driveway showing the proposed pavement design; 
6.  Proposed and existing drainage pipe, or other drains, including pipe size and type of material. Also include significant existing and proposed grading or contouring that affects the natural drainage pattern or runoff toward the roadway and the driveway connection, drainage calculations and pertinent data; 
7.  Existing or proposed retaining walls, poles, sidewalks, bikepaths, drainage structures, utilities, and any other physical features which may affect the driveway location; 
8.  The location of all existing and proposed buildings that may be served by the connection; 
9.  All parking and interior drives that may impact the connection;

11.  Distance from the right-of-way line to gasoline pumps; 
12.  The location of all trees, within the road right-of-way, specifying those trees that must be removed to construct the connection and provide adequate sight distance; 
13.  All parcels intended to use the connection; 
14.  Traffic control devices and lighting; 
15.  The actual sight distance from the connection along the public street in the direction(s) of approaching traffic; 
16.  Topographic and Boundary Survey. The topography shall extend a distance of 50 feet outside the property boundary except where water borders the property. 
E.  Additional Traffic Data: The following additional traffic data may be required by the Director and City engineer for Class III and Class IV connections and may be required for Class II: 
1.  Vehicle turning movement data for present conditions and future conditions when fully developed; 
2.  Amount and type of traffic that will be generated by the proposed development; 
3.  Traffic signal warrant analysis and signal design if appropriate. 
Section 107.120. - Connection Design Requirements. 
A.  Location of Connections: All connections shall be located at a point along the frontage that will provide acceptable sight distance, as determined by the Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways, and avoid any unreasonable interference with the free and safe movement of traffic. 
1.  Existing or proposed roadway features, such as median openings, turning lanes, intersections, drainage, traffic signals, pedestrian traffic and utilities shall be considered in accordance with guidelines in the Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways in determining the location of driveways; 
2.  In the interest of public safety and/or in an effort to maintain the level of service of the road, the City has the authority to restrict the placement of a connection to a particular location along the frontage, or to require alternative access to other public roads, if available, where direct access to a road may be unsafe or cause improper traffic operations; 
3.  No connection shall be allowed within the radius return of intersecting roadways. 
B.  Operational Characteristics of Connections: All connections should be constructed so that all entering and exiting movements can be accomplished with minimum disruption to traffic flow on the intersecting roadway. For developments having drive-in services, the service area should be far enough from the roadway to ensure adequate vehicle storage space within the property limits. No connection shall be constructed along acceleration or deceleration lanes and tapers, unless access is unreasonably denied and the connection can be designed to function safely and efficiently. 
C.  Spacing Requirements: Connection spacing shall be subject to the approval of the City. 
D.  Number of Connections: The minimum number of connections should be allowed that will adequately serve the needs of the proposed land use. There shall be no more than two (2) connections to any single property. Additional connections may be permitted when one (1) or two (2) connections will not provide adequate access due to topographic or safety conditions. Additional connections may be permitted only upon submittal of an approved traffic engineering study that indicates additional connections are warranted and do not cause operational concerns. 
E.  Widths of Connections: The actual width of the connection shall be subject to internal and external traffic flow considerations. Consideration should be given to the number of lanes, driveway geometrics, internal obstructions, and traffic safety. In no case shall a Class I connection be less than 12 feet with a 25-foot radius. All other classifications shall be a minimum width of 24 feet for two-way connections. The maximum width of any connection shall be based on a maximum lane width of 15 feet. 
F.  Length of Connections: The length of connections shall be subject to providing for an uninterrupted traffic flow on the public street. This will require that the entering vehicles not be confronted with maneuvering vehicles at the immediate point of entry, thus requiring other entering vehicles to stop in the through traffic flow. The length, therefore, will be subject to the anticipated required stacking length of entering vehicles during the peak period. Class III connections should provide a minimum length of 100 feet. 
G.  Joint Connections and Frontage Roads: Joint connections or frontage roads should be given consideration and promotion where there are several adjacent developments with limited frontage, where there is probability of such developments, and when the City determines such features are necessary and feasible in promoting the safe and efficient operation of the road. 
H.  Grades: The profiles of all connections shall be constructed in accordance with Indexes 515 and 516 of the Roadway and Traffic Design Standards. 
Section 107.121. - Traffic Control Devices. 
    The installation of regulatory signs and pavement markings at Class II, III and IV connections shall be required in order to provide for safe and efficient movement of traffic. All traffic control devices shall be installed in accordance with the City of Marathon standards, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), and FDOT roadway and traffic design standards. 
Section 107.122. - Expiration of Permit. 
    A permit shall expire within six (6) months of the date of issuance, if construction of the connection has not commenced. Incomplete construction may also cause permits to be considered null and void and subject to removal of partially constructed access if not completed within the six-month period. 
Section 107.123. - Use of Permitted Access. 
    Construction required for permit approval shall be completed prior to approval by the City for public use and related building occupancy. 
Section 107.124. - Variances. 
    Variances from certain design requirements may be granted by the City in writing and in advance of construction. 
A.  Design requirements such as driveway width, radius, angle edge clearance, corner clearance; spacing and island dimensions may be granted variances. 
B.  A variance for existing development may be considered when connections are reconstructed as a part of redevelopment and where compliance with these standards will place extreme hardship on the property owner. 
C.  Variances may also be granted if the resulting connection will result in an improved condition, such as landscaping or stormwater management, without sacrificing the safety and efficiency of the traffic operations. 
Chapter 108 - NONCONFORMITIES 
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL 

Section 108.00. - Scope. 
    The regulations of this article govern uses, density, intensity, structures, lots, signs and other situations that came into existence legally but that do not conform to one (1) or more requirements of the LDRs. These are referred to in the LDRs as "nonconformities." 
Section 108.01. - General Policy.

C.  Prohibit the expansion and alteration of nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties or the community as a whole. 
Section 108.03. - Authority to Continue. 
    Any legal nonconformity that existed on the effective date of this Ordinance, or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to the LDRs, may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
Section 108.04. - Determination of Nonconformity Status. 
    The burden of proving that a nonconformity exists rests with the subject owner. 
Section 108.05. - Repairs and Maintenance. 
A.  Incidental repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a nonconforming structure in sound condition are permitted unless such repairs are otherwise expressly prohibited by the LDRs. 
B.  Nothing in this article will be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official. 
Section 108.06. - Change of Tenancy or Ownership. 
    Nonconformity status runs with the land and is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management. 
Section 108.07. - Change in Permitted Uses Under Previous Zoning Regulations. 
    A use permitted by temporary use permit, or a use permitted by conditional use under previous zoning regulations; and which is a permitted use under the current LDRs shall be allowed to continue, extend, enlarge, expand, rebuild, or repair consistent with the requirements of the current LDRs. 
ARTICLE 2. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES 

Section 108.08. - Nonconforming Structures. 
    Nonconforming structures may remain, subject to the regulations of this Section. 
A.  Structural Alterations: 
1.  Structural alterations are permitted if the structural alteration does not increase the extent of nonconformity. 
2.  An existing lawful nonconforming mobile home may be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced only in accordance with the following requirements: 
(a)  The repaired, rebuilt, or replaced mobile home meets the requirements and limitations in Chapter 104 "Use Regulations" and shall comply with the elevation and anchoring requirements of Article 12, "Floodplain Management" of Chapter 107; and

iv.  The replacement of the mobile home is compatible with surrounding residential development and does not increase the extent of the existing nonconformity. 
3.  When a structure is nonconforming because it encroaches into a required setback, this provision will be interpreted as allowing other portions of the structure to be expanded as long as there is no further encroachment into a required setback. 
4.  Structural alterations shall be permitted if the cost of the structural alteration does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure. 
5.  Nonconforming structures lawfully existing within the shoreline setback along man-made canals, channels, or basins, or serving three (3) or fewer dwelling units on any shoreline, maybe rebuilt in the same footprint provided that there will be no adverse impacts on surface water runoff or navigation. 
B.  Moving: A nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or in part to another location on the subject parcel only if the movement or relocation decreases or eliminates the nonconformity. 
C.  Restoration of Damaged Buildings: A nonconforming building which is damaged or partially destroyed by fire, flood, wind, or other calamity or act of God or the public enemy, may be restored and the occupancy or use of such building, structure or part thereof which existed at the time of such destruction may be continued or resumed, provided that such restoration is started within a period of one (1) year of destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion. 
(Ord. No. 2018-05 , § 4, 8-14-2018) 
ARTICLE 3. - NONCONFORMING USES 

Section 108.09. - Authority to Continue. 
    The use of any building, structure or land that becomes nonconforming because of the LDRs or subsequent amendments shall comply with the LDRs or be approved by the Director as a continuing nonconforming use. The nonconforming uses in the zoning district or the adopted land use designation shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
A.  Notification: The Department will provide individual notice by mail to all landowners of record according to the most recent listing of the Property Appraiser of Monroe County of the effective date of the LDRs or any amendment and the requirement to register nonconforming uses. 
B.  Time Limit to Register: All claims of nonconforming uses shall be registered with the Department within one (1) year of the service of notice. Failure to register a claim of nonconforming use within the required time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim nonconforming use. 
C.  Approval Criteria: Evaluation shall be on a case-by-case basis; and shall be based upon the lawful nature of the use when originally established. Such determinations shall be subject to appeal as provided in Article 17 "Appeals", Chapter 102. 
D.  Burden of Proof: The burden of demonstrating compliance with these requirements shall rest with the applicant. In permitting such change, appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the intent and purpose of these regulations may be imposed by the City Council. 
Section 108.10. - Loss of Nonconforming Use Status. 
    Once a nonconforming use is abandoned, the use's nonconforming status is lost and any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. A nonconforming use will be considered abandoned when any of the following occurs: 
A.  The intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent, e.g., written declaration of the owner; 
B.  The use has been discontinued for a period of 18 months or more; 
C.  A demolition permit has been applied for; 
D.  The characteristic equipment and furnishings associated with the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar equipment within 90 days, unless other facts show intention to resume the nonconforming use;

B.  All nonconforming structures lawfully existing within the rear yard setback may be rebuilt in the same footprint, providing that there will be no adverse impacts on stormwater runoff. 
Section 108.12. - Nonconforming Density and Intensity. 
A.  Protection of Residential Density: All lawfully established residential dwelling units in existence in 1996 shall be entitled to a density of one (1) dwelling unit, subject to the provisions of the Future Land Use Element of the Plan. 
B.  Protection of Nonresidential Intensity: All lawfully established nonresidential intensities in existence on or before 1996, shall be entitled to existing intensities, subject to the provision of the Future Land Use Element of the Plan. 
ARTICLE 4. - NONCONFORMING LOTS 

Section 108.13. - Nonconforming Lots. 
A.  Dwellings on Nonconforming Lots: A building permit may be issued for a single-family dwelling or a mobile home on any legally created lot that is rendered nonconforming by the adoption of these LDRs, provided that such use is permitted otherwise under the Plan and the LDRs and complies with each and every other requirement of the Plan and LDRs. 
B.  Development on Nonconforming Lots Due to Dedication of Street Right-of-Way: A development order may be administratively issued for development of a use not meeting the minimum area, setbacks or other standards of the zone, provided that the lot was made nonconforming through dedication of street right-of-way to the adjacent road system as requested by a governmental entity; all other requirements of the zoning district must be met unless a variance has been granted by the Council. A building permit for nonresidential development shall not be issued for any nonconforming lot unless the appropriate variances have been approved by the Council and it is a permitted use in the zoning district. 
ARTICLE 5. - OTHER NONCONFORMITIES 

Section 108.14. - Nonconforming Sexually Oriented Business. 
    A nonconforming sexually oriented business shall have the right to continue only as the subcategory of sexually oriented business to which it has established its nonconforming status. These sub-categories are: sex shop; sexually oriented motion picture theater; sexually oriented media store; or sexually oriented cabaret. A retail store that has carried an inventory of sexually oriented products that equaled less than 40 percent of its total inventory and that occupied less than 40 percent of its retail floor area is simply a retail store, subject to the restrictions on retail stores under Chapter 104 "Use Regulations" and shall not have nonconforming status as a sexually oriented business. 
Section 108.15. - Additional Standards for Nonconforming Sexually Oriented Businesses. 
A.  Purpose and Intent: On the date of adoption of new standards for the location of sexually oriented businesses, there are sexually oriented businesses that already exist but that fail to conform to the location requirements imposed in the new standards. In each case, the nonconformity involves proximity to residential neighborhoods or other sensitive uses. To balance the interests of these established businesses with the interests of the affected neighborhoods and other sensitive uses, the City Council has determined that such uses should be allowed to continue to operate but should be subject to additional standards to mitigate the impacts of their proximity to these sensitive uses. 
B.  Standards: Any sexually oriented business that is a lawful nonconforming use because it is located in a zoning district that does not permit such use or because it does not conform to the separation requirements of Chapter 104 "Use Regulations" shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  Operating Hours: Each such business that offers on-premises entertainment (including live entertainment, motion pictures, videos, arcade booths, modeling or any other form of on-premises entertainment) shall be closed from 2:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. each day. This restriction on operating hours shall not apply to a nonconforming business that simply offers retail goods for sale or rental. 
2.  Restrictions on Signage: Any sign on such a business, including both those that have on-premises entertainment and those that do not, shall be oriented so that it is not legible from any lot occupied by a single-family residence, a school or a house of worship. If it is impracticable to reorient the sign to preclude its legibility from such locations, the affected sexually oriented business may either install a landscaped or other screening device to accomplish the same purpose or remove the sign. 
Section 108.16. - Motion Picture Arcade Booths. 
    Motion picture arcade booths that were legally in existence on May 2, 2007, may continue at the same location, subject to the following requirements: 
A.  Continuous Requirements: 
1.  Management shall post on each booth and enforce a requirement that only one (1) person is allowed in each booth at one (1) time; 
2.  Management shall ensure that there are no openings in walls between booths and shall immediately patch with permanent opaque material any opening that is found; 
3.  Floors, walls, seats and any other surfaces in arcade rooms shall be nonporous; 
4.  Lighting in the hallways leading to the booths and in other parts of the establishment open to the public shall at all times be maintained at a no less than ten (10) footcandles at floor level; and 
5.  There shall be no doors, curtains, shutters or other visual obstructions in the door or entrance to each booth. 
B.  Additional Requirement: Effective as of May 2, 2007, motion picture arcade booths shall be arranged or configured so that the interior of each booth is at all times clearly visible from a space of at least 500 square feet that is open to customers generally and from the cash register or other station in the establishment normally occupied by the manager or clerk on duty. 
Section 108.17. - Nonconforming Parking Areas. 
    Existing developments that contain parking areas that are not in conformance with Article 6, Chapter 107, "Parking, Loading and Stacking" shall be required to bring such areas into compliance if a change in use occurs that requires more parking spaces than the existing use. Where a change in use is proposed for buildings classified by state or local jurisdictions as historical buildings, and the change in use will not increase parking beyond those of the existing use, the nonconforming parking will not be required to be brought into compliance as long as parking is provided to the extent that sufficient land is available on the site. 
Section 108.18. - Nonconforming Signs, Sign Structures and Advertising Structures. 
    All lawful nonconforming signs shall be permitted to continue as nonconforming uses with the following limitations: 
A.  On-site Signs: 
1.  Neither the overall size nor the sign area of a nonconforming sign may be increased, nor may the location be changed, nor may the ownership or the use of the property on which it is located be changed, unless the sign is made to conform to the current requirements of the LDRs. 
2.  A sign, or at least any advertising message of a sign, now or hereafter existing, which no longer advertises a bona fide business conducted, or a product sold, on the premises shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having beneficial use of the building, structure or land upon which such sign shall be found, within 30 days after written notice by the Department. 
B.  Off-site Signs: 
1.  A sign that is a lawful nonconforming off-site sign shall be removed or made to conform to the requirements of the LDRs within seven (7) years of receipt of notice to the property owner of record by the Department notifying said owner of the nonconforming sign. 
2.  Whenever any revision or modification is made to a building or to site improvements, which revision or modification requires the submission of a site plan, or a revised site plan, all signs, sign structures, or advertising structures on the parcel of land in question shall be made to conform to the current requirements of the LDRs, or shall be removed. 
Section 108.19. - Nonconforming Outdoor Storage. 
    Any existing outdoor storage area that become nonconforming because of the LDRs or subsequent amendments shall comply with the LDRs or be approved by the Director as a continuing nonconforming use. Within one (1) year of the effective date of the LDRs, all such properties shall be screened according to the provisions of Article 8, Chapter 107, "Landscaping" and the parcel shall be brought into compliance with the City of Marathon stormwater management criteria established in Article 11, Chapter 107. 
Section 108.20. - Nonconforming Docks and Shoreline Stabilization Structures. 
A.  Docks: If more than 50 percent of the structure of a nonconforming dock, including docks on vacant parcels, is damaged or destroyed or proposed for repair or replacement then the dock may be rebuilt in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. If the reconstruction of a nonconforming dock is unable to comply with all requirements of this chapter, then it shall adhere to these requirements to the maximum extent practicable. 
B.  Shoreline Stabilization Structures: Repairs or replacements of nonconforming vertical seawalls or bulkheads on open water are exempt from the nonsubstantial improvements limitation of nonconforming structures; however, repairs or replacements must maintain the existing footprint to the maximum extent practical and must be limited to the extent necessary to maintain the integrity of the upland. Such repairs or replacements on unaltered shorelines and open water shall be permitted only if riprap with filter cloth is not a feasible alternative. 
Section 108.21. - Nonconforming Live-aboard Vessels. 
    Live-aboard vessels docked, moored, anchored, or otherwise located within the City on May 2, 2007, may remain in the City, subject to the following requirements: 
A.  Inventory: Such vessels are listed among the City's inventory of live-aboard vessels. 
B.  Pump-out Facilities: Prior to such time as being connected to an approved moorage sewage collection system, all live-aboard vessels shall contract with an approved pump-out contractor for appropriate sewage disposal.

    After the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall submit a recommended order to the Council and the parties' representatives, containing findings of fact based upon a preponderance of the evidence, conclusions of law, and suggested relief. Upon receipt of the recommended order, City staff shall immediately act to schedule another public hearing of the Council in accordance with the notice requirements in Subsection C., above. 
    The Council shall render a final order within 60 days of receipt of the recommended order. Council may not reject or modify findings of fact in the recommended order unless it first determines from a review of the entire record, and states with particularity in the final order, that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with essential requirements of law. 
D.  Appeals of the Council's decision shall be by way of petition for writ of certiorari filed in the Circuit Court for Monroe County within 30 days of entry of the Council's final order. No person may apply to a court for relief from a decision made pursuant to this Section until first exhausting the remedies provided in this article.

    Salt Marsh and Buttonwood Wetlands: Two (2) plant associations that are sometimes collectively or individually referred to as the "transitional wetland zone." The salt marsh community is a wetland area subject to tidal influence, and the vegetation is dominated by nonwoody groundcovers and grasses. The vegetation may include, but is not limited to, the following nonwoody species: 
Sporobolus virginicus Dropseed Batis maritime Saltwort Distichlis spicata Salt grass Monanthochloe Key grass Salicornia spp. Glasswort Sesuvium portulacastrum Sea purslane Spartina spatinae Cordgrass Fimbristylis castanea Chestnut sedge  
Wood vegetation that may be present includes the three (3) species of mangroves, as well as buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus); however, the salt marsh community is distinguished by the dominance of nonwoody plants, and the woody species have a coverage of less than 40 percent. The salt marsh community may be associated and intermixed with areas of almost bare ground on which the vegetation may be limited to masts of periphyton. 
The buttonwood wetland is a wetland that is usually present in the more landward zone of the transitional wetland area, and may intermix with more upland communities. The vegetation may include, but is not limited to, the following species: 
Sporobolus virginicus Dropseed Borrichia spp. Sea ox-eye daisy Bumelia celastrina Saffron plum Coccoloba uvifera Sea grape Conocarpus erectus Buttonwood Erithalis fruticosa Black torch Fimbristylis castanea Chestnut sedge Jacquinia keyensis Joewood Lycium Carolinianum Christmas berry Maytenus phyllanthoides Mayten Spartina spartinae Cordgrass  
The buttonwood wetland is distinguished from the salt marsh wetland by the dominance of buttonwood trees, usually occurring as an open stand that permits the growth of an understory of groundcovers and shrubs. The buttonwood wetland is, in turn, distinguished from more upland communities by the presence of graminoids and halophytic groundcover under its open canopy, and generally by the lack of an appreciable layer of hums and leaf litter. As reference throughout these regulations, "Salt marsh and Buttonwood" habitat refers collectively and individually to "salt marsh" and "buttonwood" habitats for the purpose of determining regulatory requirements. 
Undisturbed or high functioning saltmarsh and buttonwood accrue density in accordance with Policy 4-1.7.2, of the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan for the purposes of transferring allocated density. However, the open space for such habitats is 100 percent and are otherwise unbuildable. Disturbed or low functional categories of saltmarsh and buttonwood wetland are best defined by the KEYWEP score as outlined in Chapter 106, Article 4, Section 106.27 C.2. of the LDRs and are buildable for KEYWEP scores.

    Water-enjoyment Use: A recreational use, or other use facilitating public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which through the location, design and operation assures the public's ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. In order to qualify as a water-enjoyment use, the use must be open to the general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment. Primary water-enjoyment uses may include, but are not limited to; parks, piers, scuba diving facilities and other improvements facilitating public access to shorelines of the state; and general water-enjoyment uses may include, but are not limited to; restaurants, museums, aquariums, scientific/ecological reserves, resorts and mixed-use commercial; provided, that such uses conform to the above water-enjoyment specifications and the provisions of the master program. 
    Water-oriented Use: Refers to any combination of water-dependent, water-related, and/or water-enjoyment uses and serves as an all-encompassing definition for priority. "Non-water-oriented" serves to describe those uses which have little or no relationship to the shoreline and are not considered priority uses. Examples include professional offices, automobile sales or repair shops, mini-storage facilities, multi-family residential development, department stores and gas stations. 
    Water-related Use: A use or a portion of a use which is not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location but whose economic viability is dependent upon a waterfront location because: 
A.  Of a functional requirement for a waterfront location such as the arrival or shipment of materials by water or the need for large quantities of water; or 
B.  The use provides a necessary service supportive of the water-dependent commercial activities and that the proximity of the use to its customers makes its services less expensive and/or more convenient. 
    Waterfront: Any site shall be considered as waterfront property provided that any portion of such property physically abuts any body of water excluding swimming pools and drainage facilities which do not permit any type of sport or recreational pursuit. 
    Water Use Zone: See Hydrozone. 
    Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and, under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils. Soils present in wetlands generally are classified as hydric or alluvial, or possess characteristics that are associated with reducing soil conditions. The prevalent vegetation in wetlands generally consists of facultative or obligate hydrophytic macrophytes that are typically adapted to areas having soil conditions described above. These species, due to morphological, physiological, or reproductive adaptations, have the ability to grow, reproduce or persist in aquatic environments or anaerobic soil conditions. Florida Keys wetlands generally include tidal marshes, mangrove swamps and other similar areas. 
    Wholesaling, Warehousing, Storage and Distribution: A use engaged in storage, wholesale, and distribution of manufactured products, supplies, and equipment, but excluding bulk storage of flammable materials or hazardous wastes. 
    Wireless Communications: Any form of conveying information between locations without physical connections. 
    Wireless Communications Facility (WCF) or Facility: Any unmanned facility for the transmission and reception of radio frequency signals, usually consisting of an Antenna or group of Antennas, transmission cables, and Equipment Enclosures, and may include a Tower.

    Wireless Communications Services Provider or Provider: Any wireless service provider as defined in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 which includes Federal Communications Commission licensed commercial wireless telecommunications services such as, but not limited to; cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobile radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR), paging, radio and television broadcast services, and similar services that currently exist or that may be developed in the future. 
    Wireless Service Facility (WSF): Facility for the provision of personal wireless services, as defined by Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. A WSF is any facility for the transmission and/or reception of personal wireless services, which may consist of an antenna array, transmission cables, equipment shelter or building, access road, mount, and a guy system. 
    Xeriscape or Florida-friendly landscape: Quality landscapes which conserves water and protects the environment and are adaptable to local conditions and which are drought tolerant. The principles of Xeriscape include planning and design, appropriate choice of plants, soil analysis which may include the use of solid waste compost, efficient irrigation, practical use of turf, appropriate use of mulches, and proper maintenance, (Fla. Stat. 373.185). 
    Yard: The open space existing on the same lot with a principal building, unoccupied and unobstructed by buildings from the ground to the sky, between the lot line and building line. 
    Yard, Front: The yard extending across the entire width of the lot between the front lot line and the front building line. The lot line of a lot abutting a public street shall be deemed the front lot line. The front yard of a corner lot shall be that yard abutting the street with the least frontage, unless otherwise determined on a recorded plat or in a recorded deed.

ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL 

Section 111.00. - Purpose and Intent. 
    The intent and purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the various costs borne by the City, including its outside consultants, in reviewing and processing applications for development approvals and permits is directly borne by those persons deriving the benefit of the review, not the general public and to require that new development pay for its fair share of public facilities through the imposition of impact fees that will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the City for public facilities and services that serve such development. 
ARTICLE 2. - IMPACT FEES 

Section 111.01. - Purposes and Intent. 
    The purposes and intent of the impact fee procedures are: 
A.  To establish uniform procedures for the imposition, calculation, collection, expenditure and administration of impact fees imposed on new development and redevelopment. 
B.  To facilitate implementation of goals, objectives and policies set forth in the City of Marathon Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Regulations relating to assuring that new impact-producing development and redevelopment contributes its fair share towards the costs of capital improvements reasonably necessitated by such growth. 
C.  To ensure that new development and redevelopment is reasonably benefited by capital improvements made with proceeds of impact fees. 
D.  To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are properly incorporated in these procedures. 
Section 111.02. - General Provisions; Applicability. 
A.  Term: This article shall remain in effect unless and until repealed, amended or modified by the Council in accordance with applicable state law and local ordinances and procedures.

D.  Effect of Annual Review: This annual review may, in whole or in part, form the basis for the recommendations to the Council and Council actions to repeal, amend or modify this article and/or fee schedules; however, the Director may cite and the Council may rely upon such other data, information, reports, analyses and documents relevant to such decisions as may be available. 
E.  Amendments: Changes to this article must be made by ordinance; changes to resolutions imposing and establishing specific impact fee schedules may be made by resolution of the Council. Nothing herein precludes the Council or limits its discretion to amend this article or the resolutions imposing specific impact fee schedules at such other times as may be deemed necessary. 
F.  Affected Area: 
1.  Impact Fee District: Impact fees shall be imposed on impact-producing development within the City of Marathon Impact Fee District, comprised of the entire area of the City of Marathon, Monroe County, Florida, 
2.  Type of Development Affected: This article shall apply to all impact-producing residential and nonresidential development for which a building permit is required by this chapter. 
3.  Type of Development Exempt from Paying Impact Fees: 
(a)  Replacement residential unit: Redevelopment or rehabilitation which replaces but which does not increase square footage of legally permitted residential dwelling units existing on the site prior to redevelopment or rehabilitation. 
(b)  Replacement nonresidential development: Redevelopment or rehabilitation which replaces, but which does not increase the legally permitted floor area above that existing on the site prior to redevelopment or rehabilitation nor changes the use to one which has a greater impact-producing effect with respect to any capital improvement than that existing on the site prior to redevelopment or rehabilitation. 
(c)  Public capital improvements as defined by Chapter 110. 
(d)  Public buildings as defined by Chapter 110 owned and operated by a governmental agency that is statutorily exempt from the payment of locally adopted impact fees. 
(e)  Any other use, development, project, accessory, structure, building, fence, sign or other activity that is not impact producing. 
(f)  Affordable or employee housing units as defined by Chapter 110 for which an affordable housing deed restriction has been recorded on the chain of title. 
G.  Minimum Fee Requirements: Upon receipt of an application, the Director is hereby authorized to establish a minimum fee requirement of not less than the amount which would be imposed on 1,000 square feet of building space of industrial development, for certain proposed nonresidential developments upon a finding that; (a) the impact produced by the proposed use is de minimis; (b) that the proposed use is not included in the applicable impact fee schedule nor is it similar to any listed use; and (c) that the cost of an individual impact analysis would outweigh the impact fee otherwise calculated to be due. The burden shall be on the applicant to establish that the required findings as set forth above will be met with respect to the proposed use. 
H.  Effect of Payment of Impact Fees on a Determination of Concurrency; a Dwelling Unit Allocation; and Other Land Development Regulations: 
1.  The payment of impact fees shall not entitle the applicant to a determination of concurrency except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The requirements for a determination of concurrency is a separate, independent and additional requirement imposed by this chapter and established in Article 13, Chapter 107. 
2.  The payment of impact fees shall not entitle the applicant to a residential dwelling unit allocation award pursuant to Article 1, Chapter 107. The requirement for a residential dwelling unit allocation award is a separate, independent and additional requirement imposed by this chapter. 
3.  Neither this article nor the specific impact fee resolutions shall affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density/intensity of development, design and improvement standards or other applicable standards or requirements of this chapter, all of which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation. 
Section 111.03. - Procedures for Imposition, Calculation and Collection of Impact Fees. 
A.  Imposition: No building permit shall be issued by the City for impact-producing residential or nonresidential development unless the applicant has paid the applicable impact fees in accordance with these procedures and requirements. The Council shall set the specific impact fee schedules by resolution at the time of the adoption of the annual budget or at such other times as may be deemed necessary. 
B.  Calculation: 
1.  Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the Director shall determine whether the proposed project is impact-producing and, if so: 
(a)  Whether it is residential or nonresidential; 
(b)  The specific category of residential or nonresidential development; and 
(c)  The number of square feet of floor area. 
2.  After making these determinations, the Director shall calculate the demand for capital improvements added by the proposed project and calculate the applicable impact fee by multiplying the demand of the proposed project by the impact fee per square foot or demand unit, as the case may be, in effect at the time of building permit issuance, less and applicable credit. 
3.  If the type of land use proposed for development is not expressly listed in the specific impact fee resolution, the Director shall: 
(a)  Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the impact fee based on the impact fee per square foot or demand unit, as the case may be, for that land use; or 
(b)  Identify the broader land use category within which the specific land use would fit and calculate the impact fee based on the impact fee per square foot or demand unit, as the case may be, for that land use category. 
4.  If neither of the alternatives set forth above is appropriate for the proposed development, the demand may be determined by an individual impact analysis performed by the applicant if authorized by the specific impact fee resolution and if requested by the applicant and approved by the Director or if requested by the Director. Any individual impact analysis shall conform to the requirements of the applicable impact fee resolution and Subsection D. of this section. 
5.  An applicant may request a nonbinding estimate of impact fees due for a particular development at any time. 
6.  The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple-use development shall be based upon the aggregated demand for each capital improvement generated by each land use type in the proposed development. 
7.  The calculation of impact fees due from a phased development shall be based upon the demand generated by each specific use for which a separate building permit application is received. 
8.  All impact fees shall be calculated based on the impact fee per square foot or demand unit, as the case may be, in effect at the time of building permit issuance. 
9.  Credits: 
(a)  Credits against the amount of an impact fee due from a proposed development shall be provided for the dedication of land and/or the provision of capital improvements by an applicant when such land or capital improvements provide additional capacity to meet the demand generated by the development and when either: 
i.  The costs of such land or improvements have been included in the fee calculation methodology for the applicable category of capital improvement; or 
ii.  The land dedicated or capital improvement provided is determined by the Director to be a reasonable substitute for the cost of improvements which are included in the applicable fee calculation methodology. 
(b)  Credit applications shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall be submitted at or before the time of building permit application. The application shall be accompanied by relevant documentary evidence indicating the eligibility of the applicant for the credit. When a credit application accompanies a building permit application, the Director shall calculate the applicable impact fee without the credit and shall then determine whether a credit is due and, if so, the amount of the credit. The credit shall be applied against the impact fee calculated to be due; however, in no event shall a credit be granted in an amount exceeding the impact fee due. 
(c)  Credit for dedication of land or provision of capital improvements shall be applicable only against impact fees for the same category of capital improvements. Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a capital improvement exceeds the impact fee due for that capital improvement category, the excess value may not be transferred to impact fees calculated to be due from the applicant for other categories of capital improvements nor may the excess value be transferred to other applicants or properties. 
C.  Collection: The Director shall collect all applicable impact fees at the time of building permit issuance unless: 
1.  The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full credit; 
2.  The applicant is not subject to the payment of impact fees; or 
3.  The applicant has taken an appeal and a bond or other surety in the amount of the impact fee, as calculated by the Director, has been posted with the City. 
D.  Individual Impact Analysis: 
1.  The applicant may request, and the Director may approve or require the submittal by the applicant of an individual impact analysis if the proposed impact-producing development is a land use type generating unusual demand for one (1) or more types of capital improvements or is a land use type for which the City does not have adequate and current demand data. 
2.  An individual impact analysis shall include: 
(a)  The application for building permit, including all information described in Subsection B.1. of this section. 
(b)  The demand generated by the impact-producing development and the methodology used to calculate the demand. 
(c)  Copies of any recorded conditions on the subject property operating to limit the demand for capital improvements generated by the proposed development. 
(d)  Information and data which may be required by a specific impact fee resolution. 
(e)  Any additional information, data or analysis deemed necessary by the Director. 
3.  If authorized or required by the Director, the individual impact analysis may be submitted by the applicant at the time of building permit application or within a time period established by the Director. 
4.  All costs of the preparation, submittal and review of an individual impact analysis, whether prepared at the request of the applicant or required by the Director, and whether performed by the City, the applicant, or a consultant, shall be borne by the applicant. These costs shall be itemized by the City and paid by the applicant upon completion of the individual impact analysis, but in no event later than at building permit issuance. The costs incurred shall be charged to the applicant regardless of whether the applicant proceeds to building permit issuance or whether the demand as calculated in the individual impact analysis is accepted or rejected by the Director. 
5.  Within 30 days of the receipt of an individual impact analysis, the Director shall provide a written determination of the demand generated by the proposed development and may: 
(a)  Find that the impact fee shall be calculated based on the demand as set forth in the individual impact analysis; 
(b)  Find that the impact fee shall be calculated based on the demand, as set forth in the individual impact analysis, as modified by the Director; or 
(c)  Find that the individual impact analysis does not support a different demand and, therefore, that the impact fee should be calculated based on the demand as calculated pursuant to the specific impact fee resolution. 
6.  The findings of the Director shall be set forth in writing and shall be provided to the applicant. 
Section 111.04. - Establishment of Impact Fee Accounts; Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds; Refunds. 
A.  Impact Fee Accounts: An impact fee account shall be established by the City for each category of capital improvements for which impact fees are imposed. All impact fees collected by the City shall be deposited into the appropriate impact fee account or subaccount, which shall be interest-bearing accounts. All interest earned shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of these accounts shall not be commingled with other funds or revenues of the City. If an impact fee account has previously been established pursuant to a separate ordinance for deposit of impact fee funds, such account shall be deemed to be an impact fee account pursuant to this section. The City shall establish and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure that the impact fee funds are properly deposited and appropriated in accordance with this Article and other applicable legal requirements. 
B.  Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds: 
(1)  In general: Impact fee funds may be appropriated for capital improvements and for the payment of principal, interest and other financing costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the City to finance such capital improvements. 
(2)  Restrictions on appropriations: Impact fees shall be appropriated only: 
a.  For the category of capital improvement for which they were imposed, calculated and collected; and 
b.  Within ten (10) years of the beginning of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period is extended as provided herein. 
Impact fees shall not be appropriated for funding maintenance or repair of capital improvements, nor for operational expenses. 
(3)  Appropriation of impact fee funds beyond ten years of collection: Notwithstanding Subsection D.7.(d) of this section, impact fee funds may be appropriated beyond ten (10) years from the beginning of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection if the appropriation is for a capital improvement which requires more than ten (10) years to plan, design and construct and the demand for the capital improvement is generated in whole or in part by the development or the capital improvement will serve the proposed development. 
C.  Procedure for Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds: 
    The City, as part of the annual budget and capital improvements programming process, shall each year identify capital improvement projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The capital improvement recommendations shall be based upon the impact fee annual review set forth in Section 9.5-490.2(b) and such other information as may be relevant. 
    The recommendations shall be consistent with the provisions of this Article, the specific impact fee resolutions, applicable legal requirements, and guidelines to be adopted by the Council. 
    The Council may include impact-fee-funded capital improvements in the adopted annual budget and capital improvements program. If included, the capital improvement description shall specify the nature of the improvement, the location of the improvement, the capacity to be added by the improvement, the service area of the improvement, the need/demand for the improvement and the timing of completion of the improvement. 
    The Council may recommend impact-fee-funded capital improvements at such other times as may be deemed necessary and appropriate. Such improvements shall also be described, as set forth above, on a project description sheet. 
    The Council shall verify that adequate impact fee funds are or will be available from the appropriate impact fee accounts for the capital improvements. 
D.  Refunds: 
1.  Abandonment of Development after Issuance of Building Permit: An applicant who has paid an impact fee for a proposed development for which the applicable building permit has expired or has been revoked shall be eligible to apply for a refund of impact fees paid. 
2.  Abandonment of Development after Initiation of Construction: An applicant who has paid an impact fee for a proposed development for which a building permit has been issued and construction initiated, but which is abandoned prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be eligible for a refund unless the uncompleted building is completely demolished pursuant to a City demolition permit. 
3.  Failure of City to Appropriate Impact Fee Funds Within Time Limit: The current property owner may apply for a refund of impact fees paid by an applicant if the City has failed to appropriate the impact fees collected from the applicant within the time limits established in Subsections B.(2) and (3) of this section. 
4.  Refunds shall be made only to the current owner of property on which the impact-producing development was proposed or occurred. 
5.  Applications for refunds due to the abandonment of a development shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall be made within 60 days following the expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the structure. The applicant shall submit: 
Evidence that the applicant is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner; 
The amount of the impact fees paid by capital improvements category and receipts evidencing such payments; and 
Documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the structure pursuant to a valid City-issued demolition permit. 
6.  Failure to apply for a refund within 60 days following expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the structure shall constitute a waiver of entitlement to a refund. Upon receipt of a complete application for refund, the Director, within 60 days, shall review the application and documentary evidence submitted by the applicant and make a determination of whether a refund is due. Refunds by direct payment shall be made within 60 days following an affirmative determination by the Director. No interest shall be paid by the City with such refunds. 
7.  Applications for refunds due to the failure of the City to appropriate fees collected from the applicant within the time limits established in Subsections B.(2) and (3) of this section shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall be made within one (1) year following the expiration of such time limit. The applicant shall submit: 
(a)  Evidence that the applicant is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner; 
(b)  The amount of the impact fee paid and the capital improvement category for which a refund application is being made; 
(c)  Receipts evidencing the impact fee payments; and 
(d)  Description and documentation of the City's failure to appropriate impact fee funds for relevant capital improvements. 
8.  Upon receipt of a complete application for refund, the Director shall review the application and documentary evidence submitted by the applicant as well as such other information and evidence as may be deemed relevant, and make a determination of whether a refund is due within 60 days. Refunds by direct payment shall be made within 60 days following an affirmative determination by the Director. Refunds shall include a pro rata share of interest earned by the applicable impact fee account calculated at the average annual rate of interest for each of the years during which the applicant's impact fees were in the account divided by the number of years in which the fees were in the account. 
9.  The City may, at its option, make refunds of impact fees by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other impact fees due for the same category of capital improvements for development on the same property, or by other means subject to agreement with the property owner. 
10.  Any fee payer may appeal the director's decision on a refund application by filing a petition with the Council within 30 days of a decision by the Director. 
Section 111.05. - Appeals. 
A.  An appeal from any decision of the Director pursuant to this article shall be made to the Council; however, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the City attorney in an amount equal to the impact fee as calculated by the Director to be due, the building permit shall be issued. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the collection of the impact fee as calculated by the Director unless a bond or other sufficient surety has been provided. 
B.  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the decision of the Director is erroneous. 
Section 111.06. - Fair Share Transportation Impact Fee. 
A.  Purpose and Authority: 
1.  The Council for the City of Marathon has determined and recognized that the growth rate the City will experience through the year 2020 will necessitate a significant number of major road network improvements which make it necessary to regulate new land development activity generating traffic in order to increase the capacity of the City's road network system to maintain an acceptable level of service as determined on the basis of an average annual basis. 
2.  In order to finance these new capital improvements, regulate traffic generation levels, and ensure that accommodating that growth is economically feasible, several combined methods of financing will be necessary, one (1) of which will require all new land development activity generating traffic to pay its pro rata share of the capital expansion costs that will be incurred to expand the City's road network system. 
3.  Implementing such a regulatory scheme that requires a new land development activity generating traffic to pay a "Fair Share Fee," that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new roads created by the new land development activity, is the responsibility of the City of Marathon pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
4.  Providing and regulating arterial and other roads and related facilities to make them more safe and efficient, in coordination with a plan for the control of traffic, is also the recognized responsibility of the City through Fla. Stat. § 125.01(1)(m), and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
5.  It is not the purpose of this section to collect any money from new land development activity generating traffic in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset the demand on the City's road network system generated by the new land development activity. Existing residents will still be required to bear their appropriate share of the cost of the City's road network system. 
B.  Payment of Fair Share Fee Prior to Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy: A fair share transportation fee shall be paid by any person, including any governmental agency, prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy for any new land development activity generating traffic or materially impacting existing traffic so as to create increased demand on the City's road network system. 
C.  Establishment of Fee Schedule: Any person who shall initiate any new land development activity generating traffic or materially impacting existing traffic, except those preparing a traffic impact analysis pursuant to Subsection D. of this section, shall pay, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, a fair share transportation fee as established by resolution of the Council. 
D.  Individual Assessment of Impact of Land Development Activity on the Road Network: The Traffic Impact Analysis: 
1.  Any person who shall initiate any land development activity generating measurable traffic or materially impacting existing traffic may choose to provide an individual assessment of the demand the proposed land development activity will place on the City's road network system in order to show that the capital expansion costs necessitated by the proposed land development activity are less than the fair share fee established in Subsection C. of this section. 
2.  The individual assessment shall be undertaken through the submission of a traffic impact analysis that shall include the following information: 
3.[(a)]  The projected trip generation rates for the proposed land development activity, on an average annual basis, and at a peak design hour basis. The trip generation rates for the same or similar land use types, or state or national trip generation rate information, if applicable. 
4.[(b)]  The proposed trip length, trip distribution, and traffic assignment of the trips generated from the proposed land development activity onto the City's road network system. Trip length information shall be based upon local empirical surveys of similar land use types or trip length data compiled by the Director for average trip length for similar land use types. Trip distribution information shall be based upon the existing physical development activity, and projections of population and physical development consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
5.[(c)]  The traffic assignment of trips generated by other approved land development activity in the area on the City's road network system. 
6.[(d)]  An assessment of the capital expansion of the City's major road system necessitated by the proposed land development activity if it is to be maintained at level of service D on an average annual basis. Needed improvements shall be determined through the end of a 20-year time horizon beginning with the year the project is "built out" or completed. Standard acceptable practices and methodological procedures in the transportation planning and engineering profession shall be used to determine the capital expansion of the City's road network system necessitated by the proposed land development activity. 
7.[(e)]  An assessment of the costs of providing the capital expansion necessitated by the proposed land development activity. The cost figures used shall be based upon recent empirical information of the costs in Monroe County for the construction of a lane mile, and shall include related right-of-way costs, and the planning, design and engineering costs for the necessary capital improvements. 
8.[(f)]  An assessment of the projected tax revenues that will be derived from the proposed land development activity that can be reasonably determined to be available to pay for new capital improvements to the City's road network system over the planning horizon. 
9.[(g)]  The amount of any shortfall between the projected tax revenues and the capital expansion costs for the road network system necessitated by the new land development activity. Any shortfall shall be considered the proposed fair share transportation fee.

1.  The Council has determined and recognized that the growth rate the City will experience through the year 2020 will necessitate significant expansion of the community parks and recreational facilities in the City in order to maintain an acceptable level of active recreational opportunities for City residents. 
2.  In order to finance these new capital improvements for community parks and recreational facilities, several combined methods of financing will be necessary, one of which will require all land development in the City to pay a fair share park fee which is consistent with the principles established in Contractors and Builders Association of Pinellas County v. City of Dunedin, 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976) and Hollywood, Inc. v. Broward County, 431 So.2d 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983). 
3.  Implementing such a regulatory and financing program is the responsibility of The City of Marathon pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 163.3161 et seq., and Fla. Stat. § 125.01(1)(f), and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
4.  It is the purpose of this section to establish a regulatory system to assist in providing for new community parks needed to serve new growth and development new growth. Pursuant to this section, land development activity will be required to pay a fair share community park fee which shall not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of new community park and recreational facilities required by new growth. 
5.  It is not the purpose of this section to collect any money from new residential development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset the demand placed on new community parks and recreational facilities by the development. 
B.  Time and Amount of Payment: No certificate of occupancy for a permanent or temporary residential unit shall be issued until any applicable fair share park fee is paid. If, in the time between the date of the building permit application and the date of the request for a certificate for occupancy, the applicable fair share park fee amount is altered, the fee due shall be the lowest of the two (2) amounts. 
C.  Fair Share Park Fee to Be Imposed on New Residential Land Development Activity: 
1.  Payment of fair share fee prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy: Any person who shall initiate any new residential land development activity that places an increased demand on the City's community park facilities shall pay prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, either an alternate fee amount based upon the preparation of an individual assessment pursuant to Subsection C.2. of this subsection or, a fare share park fee established by resolution of the Council. 
2.  Individual assessment of fiscal impact of land development activity on community park facilities: The community park impact analysis. 
3.  Any person who shall initiate any land development activity that places a demand on community park and recreational facilities may choose to provide an individual assessment of the demand the proposed land development activity will place on the City's community parks in order to show the capital expansion costs necessitated by the proposed land development activity is less than the fair share fee established in this Subsection C. 
4.  The individual assessment shall be undertaken through the submission of a community park impact analysis which shall include the following information: 
5.[(a)]  The projected use of community parks and recreational facilities by the proposed land development activity. This projection shall be based upon either local empirical surveys, or state or national information. 
6.[(b)]  An assessment of the capital expansion of the City's community parks and recreational facilities necessitated by the proposed land development, if those facilities are to be maintained at standards consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Standard acceptable practices and methodological procedures in park planning and impact analysis shall be used to determine the capital expansion of the City's community park and recreational facilities necessitated by the proposed land development activity. 
7.[(c)]  An assessment of the costs for providing the capital expansion necessitated by the proposed land development activity. The cost figures used shall be based upon recent empirical information of the costs in Monroe County for acceptable park acreage, the construction costs for park equipment outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, and the planning, design and engineering costs for the necessary capital improvements. 
8.[(d)]  An assessment of the projected tax revenues that will be derived from the proposed land development activity that can be reasonably determined to be available to pay for new capital improvements to the City's community park and recreational facilities. 
9.[(e)]  The amount of any shortfall between the projected tax revenues and the capital expansion costs for the community parks and recreational facilities necessitated by the new land development activity. Any shortfall shall be considered the proposed fair share park fee. 
10.[5.]  The community park impact analysis shall be prepared by qualified professionals in the field of community impact analysis and economics, and shall be submitted to the Director. 
11.[6.]  Within 20 working days of receipt of a community park impact analysis, the Director shall determine if it is complete.
