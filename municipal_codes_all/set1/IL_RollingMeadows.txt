PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rolling Meadows, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through September 26, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. William P. Barlow, City Manager, Mr. Donald M.

Sec. 2-1017. - Request procedures for inspection or copying of public records. 
(a)  The city shall make available to any person for inspection or copying all public records, except as otherwise provided in section 2-1022 of this article and except as such disclosure would be inconsistent with the public policy of the state as set forth in 5 ILCS 140/1. Notwithstanding any other law, the city may not grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license, or otherwise, the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record as defined in the Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. 
(b)  Subject to the fee provisions of section 2-1021 of this article, the city shall promptly provide, to any person who submits a request, a copy of any public record required to be disclosed by subsection (a) and shall certify such copy if so requested. 
(c)  Requests for inspection or copies shall be made in writing and directed to the city. Written requests may be submitted to a public body via personal delivery, mail, telefax, or other means available to the city. The city may honor oral requests for inspection or copying. The city does not require that the request be submitted on a standard form or require the requester to specify the purpose for a request, except to determine whether the records are requested for a commercial purpose or whether to grant a request for a fee waiver. All requests for inspection and copying received by the city shall immediately be forwarded to the city's freedom of information officer or designee. 
(d)  The city shall, promptly, either comply with or deny a request for public records within five business days after its receipt of the request, unless the time for response is properly extended under subsection (e). 
(e)  The time for response under this section may be extended by the city for not more than five business days from the original due date for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the City Hall Building, 3600 Kirchoff Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois. 
(2)  The request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records. 
(3)  The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it. 
(4)  The requested records have not been located in the course of a routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them. 
(5)  The requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under section 2-1022 of this article or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions. 
(6)  The request for records cannot be complied with by the city within the time limits prescribed by subsection (d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the city. 
(7)  There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of the city having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request. 
(f)  When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the city shall, within five business days after receipt of the request, notify the person making the request of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of the request. 
(g)  Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the city and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the city outweighs the public interest in the information. Before invoking this exemption, the city shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If the city responds to a categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions described above are met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance will so burden the operations of the city. Such a response shall be treated as a denial of the request for information. Repeated requests from the same person for the same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or properly denied under the Act shall be deemed unduly burdensome under this provision. 
(h)  Public records will be made available for inspection and copying pursuant to this article at 3600 Kirchoff Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. and between 2:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

(2)  Deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out in 5 ILCS 140/7; 
(3)  Notify the requester that the request is unduly burdensome and extend an opportunity to the requester to attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions; or 
(4)  Provide the records requested. 
(b)  Unless the records are exempt from disclosure, the city shall comply with a request within a reasonable period considering the size and complexity of the request, and giving priority to records requested for noncommercial purposes. 
(c)  It is a violation of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1, et seq., for a person to knowingly obtain a public record for a commercial purpose without disclosing that it is for a commercial purpose, if requested to do so by the city.

(a)  When a person requests a copy of a record maintained in an electronic format, the city shall furnish it in the electronic format specified by the requester, if feasible.

The city may charge the requester for the actual cost of purchasing the recording medium, whether disc, diskette, tape, or other medium. The city will not charge the requester for the costs of any search for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the records. Except as statutorily provided, the city shall not charge fees applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a paper format when furnishing the public records in an electronic format. 
(b)  Except when a fee is otherwise fixed by statute, the city may charge fees reasonably calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing and certifying public records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment of the city to copy records. No fees shall be charged for the first 50 pages of black and white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a requester. The fee for black and white, letter or legal sized copies shall not exceed $0.15 per page. If the city provides copies in color or in a size other than letter or legal, the city will not charge more than its actual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating its actual cost for reproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the city to reproduce records, the city will not include the costs of any search for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the records. Such fees will be imposed according to a standard scale of fees, established and made public by the city. The cost for certifying a record shall not exceed $1.00. 
(c)  Documents shall be furnished at a reduced charge, taking into consideration the amount of materials requested and the cost of copying them, if the person requesting the documents states the specific purpose for the request and indicates that a reduction of the fee is in the public interest. Reduction of the fee is in the public interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or the legal rights of the general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial benefit. For purposes of this section, the term "commercial benefit" shall not apply to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or the legal rights of the general public.

Each notice of denial shall inform such person of the right to judicial review pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/11.

An agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at the principal office of the public body and at the loca-tion where the meeting is to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the meeting.

(Code 1967, § 2-427) 
Sec. 2-1068. - Written minutes and verbatim record.

(2)  The public body approves minutes of the closed meeting that meet the written minutes requirements of subsection (a) of this section. 
(d)  Each public body shall periodically, but no less than semi-annually, meet to review minutes of all closed meetings. At such meetings a determination shall be made, and reported in an open session that (1) the need for confidentiality still exists as to all or part of those minutes or (2) that the minutes or portions thereof no longer require confidential treatment and are available for public inspection. The city council shall review minutes of its closed sessions at the regular city council meeting in the months of March and September of each year. 
(e)  Unless the public body has made a determination that the verbatim recording no longer requires confidential treatment or otherwise consents to disclosure, the verbatim record of a meeting closed to the public shall not be open for public inspection or subject to discovery in any administrative or judicial proceeding other than one brought to enforce this Act. In the case of a civil action brought to enforce this Act, the court, if the judge believes such an examination is necessary, must conduct such in camera examination of the verbatim record as it finds appropriate in order to determine whether there has been a violation of this Act. In the case of a criminal proceeding, the court may conduct an examination in order to determine what portions, if any, must be made available to the parties for use as evidence in the prosecution. Any such initial inspection must be held in camera. If the court determines that a complaint or suit brought for noncompliance under this Act is valid, it may, for the purposes of discovery, redact from the minutes of the meeting closed to the public any information deemed to qualify under the attorney-client privilege. The provisions of this subsection [do not supersede the privacy or confidentiality] provisions of state or federal law. 
(f)  Minutes of meetings closed to the public shall be available only after the public body determines that it is no longer necessary to protect the public interest or the privacy of an individual by keeping them confidential.

However, if it is determined by two-thirds vote of the city council then holding office, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the city council, that it is expedient and in the best public interest to begin proceedings for the construction of a needed public work, then the provisions of this section shall not apply to the extent that the city council may employ or contract for professional services necessary for the planning and financing of such public work.

Contracts for purchases of goods or services for more than $10,000.00 in value, except those for professional services, shall be made on the basis of awarding of contracts to the lowest responsible bidder after advertising for bids has taken place.

(3)  Public works construction projects under $20,000.00 in value. The purchasing agent shall develop administrative procedures for contracts up to $20,000.00 for public works construction projects of the city over which the city possesses statutory authority to establish such procedures.

f.  The bidder and all bidder's subcontractors must participate in applicable apprenticeship and training programs approved by and registered with the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. 
The provisions of this section shall not apply to federally funded construction projects if such application would jeopardize the receipt or use of federal funds in support of such a project. 
(6)  Notice requirements for bids. Notice inviting bids shall be published at least once in a newspaper generally circulated within the city at least ten days prior to the date set for receiving such proposals by the department responsible for the project. Provided, however, that where the goods to be purchased are of a specialized nature, the notice may be published in a publication pertaining to those particular goods. Such notice shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased or the services to be performed, shall state where bid banks and specifications may be secured, including the cost, if any, of the specifications, the amount of bid deposit required and the time and location for opening buds.

(c)  Change orders. The city manager may approve through a written change order increases in public works construction contract amounts due to unforeseen environmental of manmade circumstances, not to exceed in total five percent of the awarded contract amount or $50,000.00, and to extend the time of completion of public works construction contracts for not more than 30 days without prior city council approval where applicable. The city manager shall provide a report to the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting, summarizing the dollar impact and reasoning for the change order. However, no single change order shall exceed $50,000.00, except where a delay in approving such change order would result in a financial penalty or would create a serious emergency within the city that would endanger the health or safety of its citizens. In such event, the provisions of [section] 2-1147, "emergency purchases" shall be used. The city manager shall report his or her actions in making such approvals at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. 
Notwithstanding the above, any change order for a public works contract which authorizes or necessitates any increase in the contract price that is 50 percnet or more of the original contract price or that authorizes or necessitates any increase in the price of a subcontract under the contract that is 50 percent or more of the original subcontract price, then the portion of the contract that is covered by the change order must be resubmitted for bidding in the same manner for which the original contract bid. Bidding for the portion of the contract covered by the change order is subject to any requirements to employ females and minorities on the public works project that existed at the bidding for the original contract, together with any later requirements imposed by law.

(b)  The city department heads may establish pre-qualification standards and procedures and may require prospective bidders to pre-qualify themselves for bidding on city contracts.

Another purpose for such pre-qualification shall be to save the time of the city in reviewing the bids of unqualified entities and to allow for a more expeditious bidding procedure. The standards for such pre-qualification shall be the same as those used to award a bid except for the absence of any bid price. If a bidder participates in a pre-qualification process and is found to be unqualified, the bidder shall be notified in writing of this determination and shall be given an opportunity to respond in writing and may be accorded a hearing.

(Ord. No. 08-40, § 1, 10-28-2008) 
Sec. 2-1162. - Prohibited employee relationships.

(1)  A supervisor/subordinate relationship would, or could reasonably exist, between a relative and an employee. If a direct supervisory or managerial relationship would or could reasonably be established, relatives of a current employee cannot be considered as applicants for a position; or 
(2)  The employment of a relative would create an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. For example, this policy bars the hiring or employment of an employee's relatives in any position that has an auditing or control relationship to the employee's job. 
(Ord. No. 08-40, § 1, 10-28-2008)

If accommodations of this nature are not feasible, then one of the employees will be discharged in the city's discretion. 
    Employees hired prior to January 1, 2008 found to be in one of the prohibited employment relationships described herein shall not be subject to the transfer and/or discharge provisions.

ARTICLE XIII. - PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT, INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

Sec. 2-2001. - Statement of anti-harassment/anti-discrimination policy. 
    The city is committed to maintaining a work environment which is free from all forms of harassment or discrimination of any kind. In keeping with this commitment, the city will not tolerate any form of harassment, including sexual harassment, or discrimination of any kind based upon race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, or other legally protected group status, by its elected and appointed officials or against anyone, including elected or appointed officials, supervisors, co-workers, officers, agents, vendors, customers or any third party. This policy is intended to assure that the city is taking all steps to prevent harassment and discrimination in the workplace and to correct harassing or discriminatory conduct that does occur before it becomes severe or pervasive. 
    Each city elected or appointed official bears the responsibility to refrain from discrimination or harassment in the workplace. City elected or appointed officials who engage in discriminatory or harassing conduct may be subject to disciplinary action. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of all elected or appointed officials to make sure that the work environment is free from harassment or discrimination of any kind. 
    The city also prohibits retaliation of any kind against anyone who has complained about discrimination or harassment, whether that concern relates to discrimination against or harassment of the individual raising the concern or against another individual. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2002. - Definitions and prohibited conduct. 
(a)  Sexual harrassment. Sexual harassment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Illinois Department of Human Rights, and for purposes of this policy, is defined as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, or any conduct of a sexual nature, when: 
(1)  Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's employment; 
(2)  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
(3)  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. 
Sexual harassment can occur between men and women, or members of the same gender. This behavior is unacceptable in the work place itself and in other work-related settings such as business trips, court appearances and business-related social events. 
Sexual harassment affects the victim and other employees as well. Each incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which everyone suffers the consequences. Sexually-oriented acts or sex-based conduct have no legitimate business purpose. Where such conduct is directed by an elected or appointed officials toward a employee, the former will be held to a higher standard of accountability because of the degree of control and influence he or she has or is perceived to have over the employment conditions and benefits of the employee. 
(b)  Prohibited acts. Prohibited acts of sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Examples of conduct that may constitute sexual harassment include: 
(1)  Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. 
(2)  Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises. 
(3)  Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites. 
(4)  Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault. 
(5)  Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter). 
Harassment that does not include sexual activity or language may also constitute discrimination if it is severe or pervasive and directed at employees because of their gender. 
(c)  Non-sexual harassment and discrimination. Non-sexual harassment or discrimination consists of unwelcome conduct of any kind, whether verbal or physical, or disparate treatment affecting an individual's terms and conditions of employment based upon a person's protected status such as race, color, religion, sex (gender), pregnancy, ancestry, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, or other legally protected group status. 
Harassing conduct (based on other protected categories) includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group (including through e-mail, instant messaging, texts, internet or computer usage) because of his or her protected status. 
The city will not tolerate harassing or discriminatory conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that interferes unreasonably with an individual's work performance, or that creates and intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2003. - Individuals covered under the policy. 
    This policy covers all elected or appointed officials of the city. The city will not tolerate, condone or allow harassment or discrimination, whether engaged in by fellow officres, employees, supervisors, officers, agents or by other non-employees who conduct business with the city. The city supports and encourages reporting of all incidents of harassment and discrimination, regardless of who the offender may be, and will promptly investigate all reported incidents. Where the alleged offender is not an employee or officer of the city the city manager or his or her designee, in consultation with the complainant, will review the complaint and make every effort to identify a reasonable remedy if harassment or discrimination has been confirmed. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2004. - Responsibility of supervisory employees. 
    Each elected or appointed official is responsible for maintaining the workplace free from harassment and discrimination. This is accomplished by promoting a professional environment and by dealing with harassment and discrimination as with all other forms of employee misconduct. In addition, all elected or appointed officials are required to report complaints of harassment or discrimination to the city manager. An elected or appointed official must address an observed incident of harassment or discrimination or a complaint, with seriousness, take prompt action to investigate it, report it, and end it, and implement appropriate disciplinary action. This also applies to cases where an employee tells the elected or appointed officials about behavior that constitutes sexual harassment, or other harassment or discrimination, but does not want to make a formal complaint. In addition, elected or appointed officials must ensure that no retaliation will result against an anyone making a complaint of harassment or discrimination. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2005. - Responsibility of individual employees. 
    Each individual elected or appointed official has the responsibility to refrain from harassment and discrimination in the workplace and to report incidents of harassment or discrimination. An individual elected or appointed official who harasses or discriminates against a fellow elected or appointed official or employee is, of course, liable for his or her individual conduct and will be subject to disciplinary action. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2006. - Complaint process. 
    While the city encourages individuals who believe they are being harassed or discriminated [against] to firmly and promptly notify the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome, the city also recognizes that such a confrontation may be ineffective or impossible. In the event that such informal, direct communication between individuals is either ineffective or impossible, or even when such communication has occurred, the following steps should be taken to report a complaint of harassment or discrimination. 
(1)  Reporting of incident. All elected or appointed officials are required to report any suspected harassment or discrimination to the city manager. The report may be made initially either orally or in writing, but reports made orally must ultimately be reduced to writing. 
(2)  Investigation of complaint. When a complaint of harassment or discrimination has been reported, the city manager or his or her designee will make a determination as to whether a detailed fact-finding investigation is necessary. (For example, if the alleged harasser does not deny the accusation, there would be no need to interview witnesses, and the city could immediately determine appropriate corrective action.) If a fact-finding investigation is necessary, the city manager or his or her designee will initiate an investigation of the suspected harassment or discrimination within five working days of notification. The fact-finding investigation will include an interview with the elected or appointed officials and/or employee(s) who made the initial report, the person(s) towards whom the suspected harassment was directed and the individual(s) accused of the harassment or discrimination. Any other person who may have information regarding the alleged harassment or discrimination may also be interviewed. 
(3)  Report. The person responsible for investigating the complaint will objectively gather and consider the relevant facts and shall prepare a written report within ten working days of his/her completion of the investigation of the harassment or discrimination unless extenuating circumstances prevent him/her from doing so. The report shall include a finding that harassment or discrimination occurred, harassment or discrimination did not occur, or there is inconclusive evidence as to whether harassment or discrimination occurred. The findings of the investigation will be given to the elected or appointed officials and or employee(s) who made the initial report, the elected or appointed official employee(s) to whom the suspected harassment or discrimination was directed, and the individual(s) accused of the harassment or discrimination. 
(4)  Records; confidentiality. Employees who report incidents of harassment or discrimination are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record the offensive conduct. Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related to the investigation and various reports confidential. In the event of a lawsuit, however, the city advises that records it maintains and the complainant maintains may not be considered privileged from disclosure. 
(5)  Timeframe for reporting complaint. The city encourages a prompt reporting of complaints so that rapid response and appropriate action may be taken. Delayed reporting of complaints will not, in and of itself, preclude the city from taking remedial action. 
(6)  Protection against retaliation-retaliation prohibited. The city will not in any way retaliate or permit any employee, officer or agent of the city to retaliate against an individual who makes a report of harassment or discrimination or provides information related to such report. Any witness to an incident or participant in any investigation of harassment or discrimination is also protected from retaliation. Retaliation is a serious violation of this anti-harassment/anti-discrimination policy and should be reported immediately. Any person found to have retaliated against another individual for reporting harassment or discrimination will be subject to the same disciplinary action provided for harassment/discrimination offenders. No one making a complaint of harassment or discrimination or providing information related thereto will be retaliated against even if a complaint made in good faith is not substantiated. Similar to the prohibition against retaliation as set forth in this policy, whistleblower protection from retaliatory action is afforded under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10; 5 ILCS 430/70-5), the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)) and the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101). 
(7)  Reconsideration. If either party directly involved in a harassment or discrimination investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that individual has the right to reconsideration of the decision. The disatisfied party should submit his/her written comments to the city manager for reconsideration within ten working days after the findings of the investigation are issued. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2007. - False and frivolous complaints. 
    If an investigation results in a finding that the complainant falsely accused another of harassment or discrimination knowingly or in a malicious manner, the complainant will be subject to appropriate sanctions, up to and including termination. False and frivolous charges do not refer to charges made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for an individual accused of harassment or discrimination, a false and frivolous charge is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action, including termination. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2008. - Education/training. 
    Education and training for employees at each level of the work force are critical to the success of the city's policy against harassment and discrimination. The anti-harassment/anti-discrimination policy will be distributed to all elected or appointed officials. All elected or appointed officials are required to read and sign a receipt of the city's policy. In addition, employees will receive periodic training, on city time, regarding the city's anti-harassment/anti-discrimination policy. 
    All elected or appointed officials will participate in periodic training sessions so that city elected or appointed officials understand their responsibilities under the city's anti-harassment/anti-discrimination policy and complaint procedure. Such training will explain: the types of conduct that violate the city's policy; the seriousness of the policy; the responsibilities of elected or appointed officials when they learn of alleged harassment or discrimination; and the prohibition against retaliation. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 1-23-2018) 
Sec. 2-2009. - External procedures for filing a complaint of harassment or discrimination. 
    The city hopes that any incident of harassment or discrimination can be resolved through the internal process outlined above. 
    An employee who has been physically harassed or threatened while on the job may also have grounds for criminal charges of assault and battery.

(c)  At least 14 days prior to vehicle immobilization, a notice of intended vehicle immobilization and a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the notice of impending immobilization by disproving liability for unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, or compliance violations listed on the notice, shall be sent to the vehicle's registered owner first class United States mail, postage prepaid, at the address of the registered owner recorded with the Secretary of State or, in the event that a vehicle bearing a registration number of a state other than the State of Illinois at the address of the registered owner recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles. The impending immobilization notice shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the vehicle, the nature of the ordinances violated and the numbers and issue dates of the outstanding violation notices. The notice shall also advise that a person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by appearing in person on the date, time and location as set forth in the notice and submitting evidence which would conclusively disprove liability. Evidence shall be limited to the following: 
(1)  That the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of violations were issued; or

(d)  In the event the registered owner of the vehicle fails to challenge the validity of the notice within 14 days of the notice or fails to satisfy those fines and penalties determined to be due and owing, then the vehicle shall be immobilized. 
(e)  Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place and such notice shall warn that the vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in damage to the vehicle. In addition, the notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of Sections 16-1 and 21-1 of the Illinois Criminal Code (720 ILCS 5/1-1, et seq.). The notice shall further provide information specifying how release of immobilizing restraint may be had and how the registered owner may obtain an immobilization hearing. 
(f)  In the event the immobilizing restraint has not been released, as hereinafter provided, within 48 hours of its placement on the vehicle, then the restraint shall be released and the vehicle towed and impounded at the direction of the chief of police. 
(g)  Prior to a hearing on the validity of vehicle immobilization as hereinafter provided, the owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person shall be permitted to secure the release of the vehicle by paying a deposit in an amount equal to the immobilization, towing and storage fees, if applicable, as hereinafter specified plus a bond in an amount equal to the total fines and late fees determined to be due and owing.

The notice of impoundment shall state that the owner has a right to a post immobilization and post towing hearing as hereinafter provided and that if the vehicle is not claimed within 30 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with applicable state law. 
(i)  The registered owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing was erroneous if he/she files a written demand for a hearing with the City of Rolling Meadows traffic compliance administrator within 14 days after issuance of the immobilization notice or within 14 days of the immobilization, whichever is later. Any such hearing requested shall be conducted within five days of receipt of the written demand for hearing unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Failure to request or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing. In the event of such failure, any amounts deposited pursuant to subsection (g) shall be forfeited. A hearing provided pursuant to this subsection shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of parking, standing, or compliance violation issued relative to the immobilized vehicle. Any order entered after the hearing to contest the validity of the immobilization or towing and impoundment is a final administrative decision within the meaning of 735 ILCS 5/3-101, et seq. 
(j)  The fee for immobilization shall be $200.00. In addition thereto, the registered owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with towing subsequent to immobilization as well as any and all storage fees incurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no fee shall be assessed for immobilization, towing, or storage when such action has been determined to be erroneous. 
(k)  It shall be unlawful for any person to relocate or to tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilizing device without the prior approval of the traffic compliance administrator. Any person who relocates or otherwise moves an immobilized vehicle or attempts to remove an immobilization device placed on a vehicle in violation of the provisions of this section shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $750.00.

    As used in this section "City Code" shall mean the City of Rolling Meadows Code of Ordinances.

    When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in spite of a steady red or flashing red signal indication, in violation of section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or similar provision of Section 106-625 of the City Code, the duly appointed City of Rolling Meadows official ("city official") shall, for each alleged violation recorded, issue or direct to be issued a written notice of the violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered by first class mail, postage prepaid, within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the city or its designee of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation. Prior to service of a notice of violation, the associated recorded image(s) shall be reviewed by a technician employed or contracted by the city and by a city police officer or retired city police officer, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle violated section 11-306 of the Vehicle Code and/or similar provisions of Section 106-625 of the City Code, and whether one of the defenses enumerated hereinafter is visibly applicable upon inspection of the recorded image. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation of one of the foregoing provisions and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner herein provided. The traffic compliance administrator or other duly appointed official shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the alleged violator.

(8)  A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation of a red light signal violation; 
(9)  A warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty or request a hearing to contest liability within 21 days of the mailing of the notice of violation is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle in addition to other specified penalties for failing to appear at the hearing or pay the fine in advance of the hearing; and 
(10)  A statement that the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle may elect to proceed either by paying the fine stated in the notice of violation, by challenging the charge in court, at a city administrative hearing conducted pursuant to chapter 3, of the City Code of Ordinances or contesting the violation by mail.

Sec. 3-71. - Defenses available to alleged violator for violation of a red light signal. 
    The following shall be the only defenses available for an alleged violator contesting liability for a violation of a red light signal, which shall be weighed by the hearing officer and shall only rebut the prima facie case established by the notice of violation insofar as one or more of the following defenses are established by a preponderance of the evidence: 
(1)  The motor vehicle and/or registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the exclusive control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the red light signal violation, which defense may be demonstrated through the submission of a certified copy of a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates filed with a law enforcement agency prior to the time of the alleged violation; 
(2)  The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection or turned right without stopping in spite of a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, or as part of a funeral procession; and 
(3)  The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection or turned right without stopping in spite of a red light at the direction of a police officer acting within the scope of his/her duties; or 
(4)  The operator of the vehicle received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer, which citation is determined to be a moving violation reportable to the Illinois Secretary of State. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-10) 
Sec. 3-72. - Penalty. 
    Unless the driver of the motor vehicle in question received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the alleged violation, the motor vehicle owner or lessee shall be liable for a civil penalty not exceeding $100.00 for a proved violation of this section, plus an additional penalty of not more $100.00 for failure to pay the original penalty or contest the violation at an administrative hearing in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. Any penalty imposed for a violation of this section is a civil penalty and is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of motor vehicles and, except as otherwise provided in this article, shall not be transmitted to the Illinois Secretary of State to be recorded on the driving record of the vehicle owner. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-10) 
Sec. 3-73. - Hearing. 
    The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of section 11-306 of the Vehicle Code or similar provision of section 106-625 of the City Code may request a hearing no later than the respond-by date on the notice of violation (21 days from the date of issuance of the notice), to challenge the evidence or set forth an applicable allowable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of section 11-306 of the Vehicle Code or similar provision of section 106-625 of the City Code. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in section 3-71. No hearing fees or costs shall be assessed to any person exercising his/her right to appear at a hearing and contest the validity of the violation notice. 
    The vehicle owner's or lessee's failure to appear at the hearing, or failure to contest the violation by mail in a timely manner, shall result in a finding of liability. A finding of liability entered after a hearing or in the event of a failure to appear, or contest the violation by mail in a timely manner, shall result in the hearing officer issuing a "findings, decision and order" letter which will be sent to the owner or lessee of the vehicle. A failure to pay the fine amount by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination of liability. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-10) 
Sec. 3-74. - Notice of determination of liability. 
    If the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle fails to pay the fine or contest the notice of violation, a notice of determination of liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in the amount of $100.00 is due and owing to the city. The notice will also state that the owner can petition the city to set aside the determination of liability before it becomes final. If the owner does not pay the $100.00 as specified in the notice, or fails to petition the city to set aside the determination within 14 days, a notice of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has exhausted all challenge options and the $100.00 fine is a debt due and owing to the city and must be paid within 14 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the $100.00 fine within 14 days thereafter will result in a late fee of $100.00 being added to the original fine. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-2010; Ord. No. 14-27, § 1, 10-28-2014) 
Sec. 3-75. - Final determination. 
    A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing, whether in person or contest by mail by the respond-by date, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability, failure to file a petition to set aside determination of liability in a timely manner and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures that may be provided by the City Code or the Illinois Administrative Review Law. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing, to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination shall become final upon a failure to pay the amount owed on the date provided in the "findings, decision and order" letter. Appeal from a final determination of liability may be made to the Circuit Court of Cook County pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Law. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-10)

    A notice of final determination shall be sent following the final determination of liability and after the conclusion of the period for judicial review. The notice of final determination shall include the following information: 
(1)  A statement that the unpaid fine is a debt due and owing to the City of Rolling Meadows; and 
(2)  A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the City of Rolling Meadows within 14 days may result in a petition to the Circuit Court of Cook County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment or may result in the suspension of a owner or lessee's driver's license for failure to pay fines or penalties due and owing for five or more final determinations of liability under this article. 
(Ord. No. 07-37, § 1, 10-23-2007; Ord. No. 10-54, § 1, 12-14-10) 
Sec. 3-77. - Contesting by mail. 
    Registered owners or lessees of the cited vehicle may contest the violation using the same available defenses set forth in section 3-71, but rather than attend the administrative hearing, the owner of the violating vehicle may submit any and all documentary evidence to the city's traffic compliance administrator or other duly appointed official no later than the hearing date, together with a written statement setting forth with specific reason(s) why they believe that the owner is not liable. The traffic compliance administrator or other duly appointed official shall forward all timely-submitted materials to the hearing officer for review and determination.

Sec. 3-78. - Petitions to set aside determination. 
    A petition to set aside determination of an automated traffic law violation must be filed with or mailed to the appropriate city official within 14 days of the date of mailing of the notice of determination of liability. The grounds for the petition are limited to: 
(1)  The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued; 
(2)  The person already paid the fine for the violation in question; or 
(3)  Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. 
    Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of liability, the hearing officer shall review the petition to determine if cause has been shown to set aside the determination. If cause has been shown, the city shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date on which the petitioner must appear to present his case. The city shall notify the petitioner of the hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within 14 days of the hearing officer's decision.

Sec. 3-79. - Notice of impending driver's license suspension. 
    A notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent to any person liable for any fines or penalties that remain due and owing on five or more final determinations of liability for violations of this chapter. The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall state that the failure to pay the fine owing within 45 days of the notice's date may result in the City of Rolling Meadows notifying the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/6-306.5). 
    The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the secretary of state or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States post office approved database.

    The traffic compliance administrator or other duly appointed official, by certified report, may request that the secretary of state suspend the driving privileges of an owner of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of five final determinations of liability. The report shall be certified and contain the following: 
(1)  The name, last known address of the owner of the vehicle as recorded with the secretary of state, or as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent under this chapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of the person who failed to pay the fine(s) or penalty(ies) and the registration number of any vehicle known to be registered to such person in another state;

(3)  A statement that a notice of impending driver's license suspension has been sent to the person named in the report at the address recorded with the secretary of state or at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of the lease or, if any notice sent under this chapter is returned as undeliverable at the last known address recorded at a United States post office approved database; the date on which such notice was sent; and address to which such notice was sent. 
    The city shall notify the secretary of state whenever a person named in the certified report has paid the previously recorded fine(s) or penalty(ies) or whenever the city determines that the original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein.

(b)  General regulations. 
(1)  This section is in addition to and shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing state or federal laws or any ordinance that relates to the seizure and/or impoundment of motor vehicles, and any penalty in this section shall be in addition to any and all penalties that may be assessed or imposed by a court for any criminal charges related to operating or control a motor vehicle by a person while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. 
(2)  The provisions of this section are inapplicable if at the time of the offense the vehicle used in the violation was stolen or otherwise operated without the knowledge and express or implied consent of the registered owner and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authority within 24 hours after the theft was discovered. 
(3)  Any and all fees for towing and storage of a vehicle under this section shall be those approved by the chief of police for all towing companies authorized to tow for the city. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  Whenever a police officer has cause to believe that a motor vehicle is subject to impoundment, the officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the city. 
(2)  At the time the vehicle is towed, the city shall notify or make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner, lessee, or person identifying himself or herself as the owner or lessee of the vehicle, or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense, of the fact of the seizure, and of the vehicle owner's or lessee's right to an administrative hearing. 
(3)  The city shall also provide notice that the motor vehicle will remain impounded pending the completion of an administrative hearing, unless the owner or lessee of the vehicle or a lienholder posts with the city a bond equal to the administrative fee as provided herein and pays for all towing and storage charges. 
(4)  The registered owner or lessee of the vehicle and any lienholder of record shall be provided with a notice of hearing. The notice shall: 
a.  Be served upon the owner, lessee, and any lienholder of record either by personal service or by first class mail to the interested party's address as registered with the Secretary of State; 
b.  Be served upon interested parties within ten days after a vehicle is impounded by the city; and 
c.  Contain the date, time, and location of the administrative hearing. An initial hearing shall be scheduled and convened no later than 45 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of hearing. 
(d)  Preliminary hearing. If the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section desires to appeal the seizure and impoundment he or she must make a request for a preliminary hearing within 24 hours of the seizure. The request shall be deemed filed upon delivery to the chief of police care of the Rolling Meadows Police Department. The preliminary hearing request shall be in writing and the chief of police or his designee shall conduct the preliminary hearing within 24 hours after receipt of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or city holidays, in which case the preliminary hearing shall be heard on the next business day after the request. All interested parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, he/she shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the city a cash bond in the amount of $500.00, and pays the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief of police or his/her designee determines that there is no such probable cause to believe the vehicle was operated while the operator was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, the vehicle will be returned to the registered owner without penalty or other fees. 
(e)  Hearing. The owner shall appear at the hearing and enter a plea of liable or not liable. If a plea of liable is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner pleads not liable, a final seizure/impoundment hearing shall be scheduled and held, no later than 45 days after the vehicle was seized, unless continued by order of the hearing officer. Continuances shall be granted only for good cause. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of any party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. Subpoenas for the production of witnesses and records may be issued upon request and for good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation of an offense set forth in subparagraph (a) hereof, the hearing officer shall enter a written decision finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the city for an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $500.00 and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the city plus pays any and all fees to the tower for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If after proper service of notice, the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the city, a copy of which default order shall be sent to the registered owner via first class mail. If at the hearing the hearing officer enters a written decision that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle and cash bond without assessing fees or penalty. 
(f)  Administrative penalty. If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the City of Rolling Meadows. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be forfeited to the city. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the city and any applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to a person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment and lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 35 days after an administrative penalty is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 35 days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within 35 days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. All final decisions of the administrative hearing officer shall be subject to review under the provisions of the Administrative Review Law. Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this section which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Law may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(g)  Vehicle possession. 
(1)  Except as may otherwise be provided by law, no owner, lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person or other entity with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the city the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle shall be the record title holder as registered with the Secretary of State, State of Illinois. 
(h)  [Hearing officer; appointment; requirements.] The hearing officer shall be appointed by the city manager and shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Illinois for a minimum of three years next preceding the date of his/her appointment. 
(i)  Disposition of penalties. Penalties or fees received by the city pursuant to this section 3-90 shall be deposited to the police towing fund. The city council shall in its annual budget determine the amount of fees and penalties to be deposited in the police towing fund. When the total fees and penalties deposited to the police towing fund equal the city council specified annual budget amount for the police towing fund, all additional fees and penalties shall be deposited to the general corporate fund.

Sec. 3-104. - Evidence, confidentiality, defenses, penalty. 
(a)  Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be prima facia evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this section. 
(b)  Recorded images made by an automated traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation. 
(c)  The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation: 
(1)  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation; 
(2)  That the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a violation of section 11-1414 of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; 
(3)  That the visual signals required by sections 12-803 and 12-805 of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code were damaged, not activated, not present in violation of sections 12-803 and 12-805 of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, or inoperable; and 
(4)  Any other evidence or issues provided by the city's Code of Ordinances.

(e)  Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $150.00 for a first time violation or $500.00 for a second or subsequent violation, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100.00 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle, but may be recorded by the city for the purpose of determining if a person is subject to the higher fine for a second or subsequent offense. 
(Ord. No. 14-03, § 1, 1-14-2014) 
Sec. 3-105. - Hearing. 
    The owner of the vehicle being operated in violation of section 11-1414 of the Vehicle Code or section 106-625-5/11-1414 of the City Code may request a hearing no later than the respond-by date on the notice of violation (21 days from the date of issuance of the notice), to challenge the evidence or set forth an applicable allowable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of section 11-1414 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or section 106-625-5/11-1414 of the City Code. The notice shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in section 3-104(c) of this section. No hearing fees or costs shall be assessed to any person exercising his/her right to appear at a hearing and contest the validity of the violation notice. 
    The vehicle owner's or lessee's failure to appear at the hearing, or failure to contest the violation by mail in a timely manner, shall result in a finding of liability. A finding of liability entered after a hearing or in the event of a failure to appear, or contest the violation by mail in a timely manner, shall result in the hearing officer issuing a "finding, decision and order" letter which will be sent to the owner or lessee of the vehicle. A failure to pay the fine amount by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination of liability. 
(Ord. No. 14-03, § 1, 1-14-2014) 
Sec. 3-106. - Notice of determination of liability. 
    If the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle fails to pay the fine or contest the notice of violation within 21 days of the notice of violation, a notice of determination of liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in the amount of $150.00 for a first offense or $500.00 for a second offense is due and owing to the city. The notice will also state that the owner can petition the city to set aside the determination of liability before it becomes final. If the owner does not pay the $150.00, or $500.00, if applicable, as specified in the notice, or fails to petition the city to set aside the determination, within 14 days, a notice of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has exhausted all challenge options and the $150.00 fine or $500.00 as the case may be, is a debt due and owing to the city and must be paid within 14 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the fine within 14 days thereafter will result in a late fee of $100.00 being added to the original fine.

Where a person fails to appear at a hearing, to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination shall become final upon a failure to pay the amount owed on the date provided in the "findings, decision and order" letter. Appeal from a final determination of liability may be made to the Circuit Court of Cook County pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Review Law.

(2)  A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the City of Rolling Meadows within 14 days may result in a petition to the Circuit Court of Cook County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment or may result in the suspension of a owner or lessee's driver's license for failure to pay fines or penalties due and owing for five or more final determinations of liability under this article.

Sec. 3-109. - Contesting by mail.

The traffic compliance administrator or other duly appointed official shall forward all timely-submitted materials to the hearing officer for review and determination.

The report shall be certified and contain the following: 
(1)  The name, last known address of the owner of the vehicle as recorded with the secretary of state, or as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent under this chapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of the person who failed to pay the fine(s) or penalty(ies) and the registration number of any vehicle known to be registered to such person in another state;

Sec. 3-114. - Statistical analysis. 
    The police department shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact in each school district using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the city. If the statistical analysis for the 36-month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of accidents at the approach to school buses monitored by the system, the city shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the accidents, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the accidents involving school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system.

The driver's license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by a police officer if needed for enforcement of this article. 
    Upon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, a police officer may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this article, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.

Such license shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, but it shall cease upon the death of the licensee, provided that executors or administrators of the estate of the deceased licensee and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor, may continue the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor under order of the appropriate court, and may exercise the privilege of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt until the expiration of such license, but no longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee. Except for a nonbeverage user's license, a refund shall be made of that portion of the license fees paid for any period in which the licensee shall be prevented from operating under such license in accordance with this subsection. Any licensee may renew his license at the expiration thereof, provided he is then qualified to receive a license and the premises for which such renewal license is sought are suitable for such purpose, and provided, further, that the renewal privilege provided for in this article shall not be construed as a vested right which shall in any case prevent the city council from decreasing the number of licenses to be issued within its jurisdiction. No retailer's license shall be renewed if the department of revenue has reported to the state liquor control commission that such retailer is delinquent in filing any required tax returns or paying any amounts owed to the state until the applicant is issued a certificate by the department of revenue stating that all delinquent returns or amounts owed have been paid by guaranteed remittance or the payment agreement to pay all amounts owed has been accepted by the department. No retailer's license issued by a local liquor control commissioner shall be renewed unless the applicant provides documentation that any tax owed to (i) the municipality in which the applicant is located (in the case of a license issued by the mayor or president of the board of trustees of a city, village or incorporated town acting as local liquor control commissioner) or (ii) the county in which the applicant is located (in the case of a license issued by the president or chairman of a county board acting as local liquor control commissioner) by the applicant has been satisfied by payment in the form of a cashier's check, certified check, money order, or cash. A negotiable instrument received as payment for a license fee, transfer fee, late fee, offer in compromise, predisciplinary conference settlement, or fine imposed by order that is dishonored on presentation shall not be considered payment and shall be cause for disciplinary action. 
(b)  The liquor commissioner in his/her sole discretion, may issue a temporary liquor license: 
(1)  If the holder of a liquor license enters into a contract for the sale of the business pending the issuance of a liquor license to the prospective new owner.

The liquor commissioner must be satisfied that the proposed temporary license holder will operate the business in accordance with applicable state and city laws and is of good character. The duration of the temporary license shall be 90 days or the time required to review the new owner's application for liquor license and to complete an investigation of the applicant to enable the liquor commissioner to make a decision on the application for the liquor license, whichever time is lesser. The issuance of the temporary license creates no property right in the holder thereof nor does it increase the number of licenses available under this article nor does it predispose or require the liquor commissioner to issue the applied for liquor license. 
A temporary license shall not be issued unless the applicant has posted with the liquor commissioner proof of dram shop liability insurance as specified in section 6-34(8) of this chapter.

Proof that the defendant-licensee or any principal, officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of such licensee demanded, was shown, and reasonably relied upon such written evidence in any transaction forbidden by this subsection is an affirmative defense in any criminal prosecution therefor or to any proceeding for the suspension or revocation of any license based thereon.

(3)  Dangerous dog.

(Ord. No. 07-39, § 1, 11-27-2007) 
Sec. 14-115. - Dogs deemed vicious. 
(a)  In order to have a dog deemed "vicious," the animal administrator must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the dog is a vicious dog and give the report to the state's attorney's office and the owner. The animal administrator, state's attorney, or any citizen of the county in which the dog exists may file a complaint in the circuit court in the name of the people of the State of Illinois to deem a dog to be a vicious dog. Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, a board certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the dog's behavior was justified. The petitioner must prove the dog is a vicious dog by clear and convincing evidence. The animal administrator shall determine where the animal shall be confined during the pendency of the case. 
    A dog may not be declared vicious if the court determines the conduct of the dog was justified because: 
(1)  The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog, or was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises or property owned or occupied by the owner of the animal; 
(2)  The injured, threatened, or killed person was abusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the dog or its offspring, or has in the past abused, assaulted, or physically threatened the dog or its offspring; or 
(3)  The dog was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or offspring. 
    If a dog is found to be a vicious dog, such dog shall at all times be kept in an enclosure. The dog shall be spayed or neutered within ten days of said determination at the expense of its owner and microchipped, if not already spayed, neutered or microchipped. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or harbor a vicious dog on a porch or patio or in any part of a house or building that would allow the dog to exit such structure on its own volition. The only times that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure are: 
(1)  If it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the vicious dog; 
(2)  In the case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog's life is threatened; or 
(3)  To comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that said vicious dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding six feet in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dog or muzzled in its residence. 
    In addition, the owner of a vicious dog must comply with the following conditions: 
(1)  The owner, at his/her own expense, shall acquire a special license tag from the city designating the animal as vicious, and shall post signage at the front and rear property lines of the premises on which said animal is kept, which signage reads as follows: "BEWARE OF VICIOUS DOG." 
(2)  The owner shall notify the city within 24 hours if the dog is loose, unconfined, has attacked another animal, or has attacked a human being, or has been removed from the city, or has died. 
(3)  The owner must provide proof that the dog has been neutered. 
(4)  The owner of a vicious dog shall present to the city proof that the owner has procured liability insurance in the amount of at least $100,000.00, covering the 12-month period during which licensing is sought. The insurance policy shall contain a provision that the city will be notified by the insurance company of any cancellation, termination or expiration of the policy. 
(5)  The owner, at his/her expense, shall attend classes in dog obedience and care offered through any approved institution, park district or licensed trainer. 
(6)  The owner shall allow inspection by the animal administrator without prior notification, on a regular basis, but not more than three times a year, of the premises in which the vicious animal is kept. The animal administrator shall determine whether or not the enclosure is secure, that facilities exist to adequately feed, house and maintain the animal, that the location of the enclosure is not likely to endanger the peace, quiet, health, safety or comfort of persons in the vicinity of the location, and that maintenance of the dog in the location has not resulted in or is not likely to result in the animal being subjected to neglect, suffering, cruelty or abuse. 
(b)  Any dog that has been found to be a vicious dog and is not confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the animal administrator. 
    If the owner of the vicious dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the circuit court with 15 working days, the animal may be euthanized. 
    Upon filing a notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear all costs associated with the impoundment and the burden of timely notification to the animal administrator in writing. 
(c)  No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away any vicious dog without approval from the animal administrator or court. 
(d)  If the owner of a vicious dog is unwilling or unable to comply with the foregoing regulations, then the owner shall have the animal humanely euthanized by an animal shelter, animal control agency, or licensed veterinarian. 
(Ord. No. 07-39, § 1, 11-27-2007) 
Sec. 14-116. - Dangerous dogs. 
(a)  The animal administrator may find a dog to be a dangerous dog after a thorough investigation including sending, within ten business days of the animal administrator becoming aware of the alleged infraction, notifications to the owner of the alleged infractions, the fact of the initiation of an investigation, and affording the owner an opportunity to meet with the animal administrator prior to the making of a determination; gathering of any medical or veterinary evidence; interviewing witnesses, and making a detailed written report. No dog shall be deemed a dangerous dog unless shown to be a dangerous dog by a preponderance of the evidence. The owner shall be sent immediate notification of the determination by registered or certified mail that includes a complete description of the appeal process. 
    A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the animal administrator determines the conduct of the dog was justified because: 
(1)  The threat was sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog or was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises or property occupied by the owner of the animal; 
(2)  The threatened person was abusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the dog or its offspring; 
(3)  The injured, threatened or killed companion animal was attacking or threatening to attack the dog or its offspring; or 
(4)  The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or a member of its household, kennel, or offspring. 
    If a dog is found to be a dangerous dog, the dog shall be spayed or neutered within 14 days of the finding at the expense of the owner and microchipped, if not already, and one or more of the following as deemed appropriate by the animal administrator or his appointee: 
(1)  Evaluation of the dog by a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or other recognized expert in the field and completion of training or other treatment as deemed appropriate by the expert. The owner of the dog shall be responsible for all costs associated with the evaluation and training ordered under this section. 
(2)  Direct supervision and leash control by an adult 18 years of age or older when the animal is on public or private property other than the property of the owner. 
(3)  The dog shall be muzzled when the animal is on public or private property other than the property of the owner in a manner that will prevent it from biting any person or other animal. 
(b)  The owner, at his/her own expense, shall acquire a special license tag from the city designating the animal as dangerous, and shall post signage at the front and rear property lines of the premises on which said animal is kept, which signage reads as follows: "BEWARE OF DANGEROUS DOG." 
(c)  It is unlawful for any person to knowingly or recklessly permit any dangerous dog to leave the premises of its owner when not under the control by a leash or other recognized control methods. 
(d)  The owner of a dog found to be a dangerous dog by the animal administrator or his appointee may file a complaint against the animal administrator or his appointee in the circuit court within 30 days of receipt of the notification of the determination.

    Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the physically handicapped, and sentry, guard or police-owned dogs are exempt from this article; provided an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section, each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies and registered with the city for its specific duties.

    Control area emergency means that control area is at risk of having to shed firm load, having taken or committed to take all feasible mitigating action short of shedding firm load and firm sales. 
    Controlled rotating interruptions of electrical service means the implementation of a plan to curtail electric service to firm load customers for a short period of time and rotating this curtailment of electric service through different areas within the electric utility's service territory in a situation where the demand has exceeded or is at significant risk of exceeding the supply of electricity available to the electric utility. The action of an electric utility to interrupt or curtail electric service to a customer participating in or taking service under an interruptible or curtailable rate is not included in this definition of a "controlled rotating interruption of electric service." 
    Emergency energy plan means the portions of the emergency load conservation procedures, which immediately precede and include the controlled rotating interruption of electrical service to firm load customers within the city. The emergency energy plan shall include the following steps:

The electric utility company shall be required to examine and update, as needed its emergency energy plan at least annually. The electric utility company shall notify the city manager in writing of any material revisions to its plan and the rationale for said revisions within five business days of the time said revisions are made. 
(1)  The emergency energy plan shall include, at a minimum, information detailing: 
a.  Circumstances that would require the implementation of the emergency energy plan; 
b.  Stages of the emergency energy plan; 
c.  The approximate geographic limits of each outage area provided for in the emergency energy plan;

(a)  Upon submittal of the emergency energy plan to the city, the city shall review the emergency energy plan in order to determine if the emergency energy plan is complete and to assure appropriate coordination with public health and safety agencies. The city may reject the emergency energy plan if it does not contain all the information required under section 34-251, in which case the city shall notify the electric utility company in writing of said rejection and the reasons therefor. The electric utility company shall thereafter submit a complete emergency energy plan to the city no later than 30 days after the city sends such notice. 
(b)  The city and the electric utility shall work cooperatively to: 
(1)  Identify customers and facilities for which a controlled rotating interruption of electric service would require heightened response by city public health and safety agencies; 
(2)  Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on public health and safety; and

(3)  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any of the following factors if they are found appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable:

(2)  In addition to the remedy provided in paragraph (1) above, the court may impose upon the owner of the property a civil penalty in the amount of not less than $100.00 or more than $1,000.00 per day payable to the City of Rolling Meadows, for each day the owner had actual knowledge that the property was a public nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a public nuisance property. 
(3)  In determining what remedy or remedies to employ, the court may consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The disturbance of neighbors. 
b.  The occurrence of other nuisances on or from the property. 
c.  The property's general reputation and/or the reputation of persons in or frequenting the property. 
(4)  The court may authorize the city to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the city is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the city to affect the closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property and debt to the city. As used herein, "costs" means those costs actually incurred by the city for the physical securing of the property. 
(5)  The city department affecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs, and the city shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
(6)  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the city.

For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans, and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 46-69 of this article. 
(2)  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the community development director shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the special flood hazard area and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(3)  The community development director shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The community development director shall not issue a permit unless all other applicable local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(c)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. For this purpose, the following is required: 
(1)  Data submitted. If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data, including an as-built of the filled area, signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor, showing the revised topographical data in the USGS datum, and obtain a letter of map revision from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
(2)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation as determined by the city engineer. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.0 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure as required by the city engineer. For streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All required floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All required floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
Exception: Lots less than one-third acre in area and filling less than 20 cubic yards in the flood fringe for building additions or floodproofing activity when done in accordance with other applicable city codes.

(c)  Preventing increased damages; list of appropriate uses. 
(1)  Generally. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code part 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise inappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence and storage of materials except as specifically defined in this subsection as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
a.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
b.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of or requiring access to the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses. 
c.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls. 
d.  Underground and overhead utilities. 
e.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing, at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction, built parallel to the direction of flood flows and including open air pavilions. 
f.  Detached garages, storage sheds or other nonhabitable accessory structures to existing buildings without toilet facilities that will not block flood flows or reduce floodway storage. 
g.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto. 
h.  Parking lots and any modifications thereto, where depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot, and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation. 
i.  Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse. 
j.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
k.  For damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the property before it was damaged or replaced and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building. 
l.  Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's footprint and are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the property. 
(2)  Engineering and mitigation criteria. Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible, provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 46-69 of this article: 
a.  Preservation of flood conveyance. Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
1.  Regulatory floodway conveyance, 1.486 K n where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A1" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter (see Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York). 
2.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions, unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative land cover to a nonvegetative land cover. 
3.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, through engineering calculations or model tests, that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
i.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
ii.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
iii.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
iv.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation of adjacent properties. 
v.  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
b.  Preservation of floodway storage to not increase downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations, that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure. 
c.  Preservation of floodway velocities to not increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, for bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
d.  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks, such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
1.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 46-65 of this article. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
2.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated at per subsection (c)(2)b of this section. 
3.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (c)(2)c of this section. 
4.  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a department of transportation permit be received. 
5.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, for concurrence that a conditional letter of map revision is not required by subsection (c) of this section. 
6.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection (c)(2)h of this section. 
e.  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and approach roads. 
1.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than a 0.1-foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
2.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects of flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
3.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and shall be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the department of transportation rules 92 Ill. Adm. Code part 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the office of water resources for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
f.  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event, shall be contained within the channel banks or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks, such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or a waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures, as defined in section 46-61, shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm. Code part 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention. 
2.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning. 
3.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and presedimentation basin. 
4.  A non-point-source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as to minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed shall coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control. 
5.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
g.  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
h.  Excavation in floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, through engineering calculations or model tests, that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
3.  When expanded or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
i.  Channel modification. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
2.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
3.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
i.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical; 
ii.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion; 
iii.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation; 
iv.  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for the construction of the channel; 
v.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, whenever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives; 
vi.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover; 
vii.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles or other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate; 
viii.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality; 
ix.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry, and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel; 
x.  There should be no increase in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project; 
xi.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
4.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
j.  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k.  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
2.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
3.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches and sediment basins. 
4.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels, per subsection (c)(2)p of this section. Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
5.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988), also known as the Green Book, and Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (IEPA, 1987). 
l.  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations, that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
m.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
1.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 46-65, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
2.  If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by the backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
3.  If the applicant learns from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
n.  Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state department of natural resources, office of water resources. For nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before state department of natural resources, office of water resources, approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision is issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state department of natural resources, office of water resources. 
o.  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
p.  Construction within 25 feet of channel. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
2.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
3.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the as-built plans. 
(d)  State review. For the projects listed in this subsection that are located in a regulatory floodway, the following information shall be submitted to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, for its review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit: 
(1)  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection (c)(2)d of this section.

(e)  Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/4.9 et seq. No permit from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, shall be required if the office has delegated this responsibility to the city. 
(f)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in section 300 per 92 Ill. Adm. Code part 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall require a state office of water resources dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of the dam. If the community development director finds a dam that does not have a permit, the community development director shall immediately notify dam safety section of the office of water resources. If the community development director finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the community development director shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, dam safety section, in Springfield and the state emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA). 
(g)  Activities not requiring registered professional engineer's review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements:

Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevations as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the special flood hazard area and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(3)  Other permits or approvals. The community development director shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The community development director shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(b)  Preventing increased damages. No development in a special flood hazard area, where a floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. 
(1)  Standards for riverine special flood hazard areas. Within all riverine special flood hazard areas where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
a.  The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of subsections 46-67(c)(2)a through (c)(2)l for the entire floodplain as calculated under subsection 46-65(e) of this article. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, for review and approval. After the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, approves the floodway, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section 46-67 for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in section 46-61 of this article. 
b.  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, or written documentation that a permit is not required from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources. 
c.  No permit from the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, shall be required if the office has delegated permit responsibility to the city per 92 Ill. Adm. Code part 708 for regulatory floodways, per the state department of natural resources, office of water resources statewide permit entitled "Construction in Floodplains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois." 
d.  Any work involving the construction modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water, as defined in section 46-61, shall obtain an office of water resources dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the community development director finds a dam that does not have a state department of natural resources, office of water resources permit, the community development director shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the office of water resources. If the community development director finds a dam that is believed to be in unsafe condition, the community development director shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the state emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA) and the state department of natural resources, office of water resources, dam safety section, in Springfield. 
e.  The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway; such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article: 
1.  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
i.  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
ii.  Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
iii.  For underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing streambed; and 
iv.  For overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse, and the utilities are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
2.  Storm sewer outfalls that: 
i.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; 
ii.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
iii.  Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the outfall location. 
3.  Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that: 
i.  Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length. 
ii.  Has materials that are not placed higher than the existing top of bank. 
iii.  Has materials placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area of the floodplain by more than ten percent. 
4.  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
i.  The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above the natural grade. 
ii.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert. 
iii.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
iv.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
v.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization. 
5.  The construction of light poles, signposts and similar structures. 
6.  The construction of sidewalks; driveways; athletic fields, excluding fences; patios; and similar surfaces which are built at grade. 
7.  The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports built at or below the existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of floodwaters. 
8.  The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding 70 square feet in size or more than ten feet in any one dimension (e.g., animal shelters and tool sheds). 
9.  The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20 percent, which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building and which do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of floodwaters. 
10.  Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where: 
i.  The affected length of the stream is less than 1,000 feet. 
ii.  The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels; or 
iii.  The cross sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site. 
iv.  Dredge material will be placed in an upland site (nonwetland or non-special flood hazard area site). 
v.  The flood-carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(2)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. For streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the existing ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

Sec. 46-71. - Variances. 
(a)  No variances shall be granted to any development located in a regulatory floodway, as defined in section 46-61. However, when a developmental proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway and whenever the standards of this article place undue hardship on a specific developmental proposal, the applicant may apply to the community development director for a variance. The community development director shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit his recommendation to the city council. 
(b)  No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that: 
(1)  The development activity cannot be located outside the special flood hazard area; 
(2)  An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted; 
(3)  The relief requested is the minimum necessary; 
(4)  There will be no additional threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation of a nuisance; 
(5)  There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to streambeds and stream banks, roads, utilities or other public facilities; 
(6)  The provisions of subsections 46-66(c) and 46-68(b) of this article shall still be met; 
(7)  The activity is not in a regulatory floodway; 
(8)  The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a general problem; and 
(9)  The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses. 
(c)  The community development director shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of section 46-69 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will: 
(1)  Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; 
(2)  Increase the risks of life and property; and 
(3)  Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability. 
(d)  Variance requested in connection with restoration of a site or building listed on the National Register of Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(Code 1967, § 81/2-11) 
Sec. 46-72. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the special flood hazard area, will be free from flooding or damage. This article does not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision made lawfully under this article. 
(Code 1967, § 81/2-12) 
Sec. 46-73. - Penalty. 
(a)  Under this article, failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this article.

Sec. 70-226. - Findings. 
    The General Assembly of the State of Illinois has found that tobacco smoke is a harmful and dangerous carcinogen to human beings and a hazard to public health. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes at least 65,000 deaths each year from heart disease and lung cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes heart disease, stroke, cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, low birth weight in infants, asthma and exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia in children and adults. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Illinois workers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke are at increased risk of premature death. An estimated 2,900 Illinois citizens die each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. 
    The General Assembly of the State of Illinois has also found that the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report has determined that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; the scientific evidence that secondhand smoke causes serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma, is massive and conclusive; separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate secondhand smoke exposure; smoke-free workplace policies are effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure; and smoke-free workplace policies do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. 
    The General Assembly of the State of Illinois has further found that the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are capable only of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments because it cannot determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer-causing chemicals, and ASHRAE acknowledges that technology does not exist that can remove chemicals that cause cancer from the air. A June 30, 2005, ASHRAE position document on secondhand smoke concludes that, at present, the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to eliminate all smoking activities indoors.

(2)  Renegotiate any term and condition of the franchise before any final decision to approve the sale, transfer, delegation or assignment of the franchise from the grantee to a person or group of persons is approved by the city in accordance with this article. 
(e)  Negotiations. Upon completion of review of the application for modification of the franchise by the franchising authority and the franchising authority has not made a final determination regarding the merit of the requested modifications, the grantee may request negotiations with the franchising authority for modification of service requirements in accordance with section 625 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended. The franchising authority shall permit such negotiations to proceed only in such cases where the grantee agrees to provide a mix, quality, and level of services which the grantee and the franchising authority believe are in the best interest of the subscribers. The franchising authority shall have 120 calendar days to negotiate and approve such modifications unless the grantee and the franchising authority agree to an extension of time. 
(f)  Procedures for approval or denial. Procedures for approval or denial shall be as follows: 
(1)  Upon receipt of the request for modifications by the grantee, the franchising authority shall indicate its decision to grant or deny the grantee's request for modifications within 120 calendar days of its receipt of the modification request. The grantee and franchising authority may mutually agree to extend the 120-day time period. The franchising authority shall state its decision for approval or denial or the request for modifications at a public meeting of the city council. 
(2)  If the franchising authority denies the grantees request for modifications, the grantee may commence an action for judicial review of the franchising authority's determination in accordance with the process set forth in section 625(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, or any successor provision. 
(g)  Costs incurred with modification of franchises. 
(1)  Upon the application, or notice, of a modification request by a grantee, the franchising authority shall prepare an estimate of its costs to consider the modification. The costs may include, but not be limited to, reasonable fees for any or all of the following professionals: an attorney, an accountant, an engineer, municipal staff, and other professionals with expertise or training relating to the modification. The franchising authority shall provide to the grantee the estimate of fees and costs within 45 days of the grantee's application or notice. The grantee may appeal the franchising authority's estimate to the appropriate city official to initiate the modification request based upon the estimated expenses, or withdraw the request. In no event shall the liability for actual costs and fees exceed the estimate by 25 percent and in no event shall the grantee's liability for the payment of fees and expenses exceed 50 percent of the preceding year's franchise fee or fee in-lieu of franchise fee payment. The 50 percent figure is intended as an agreed-upon cap to the expenses by the parties and not a claim against the franchise fee or fee in-lieu of franchise fee by the grantee. Should the franchising authority initiate a request for modification of the franchise, each party shall bear their own costs and fees.

(e)  During a review and evaluation by the city, the grantee shall fully cooperate with the city and shall provide such information and documents as the city may reasonably need to perform its review. 
(f)  If at any time during its review the franchising authority determines that reasonable evidence exists of inadequate performance of the cable system or multichannel video system, it may require the grantee to perform tests and analysis directed toward the suspected inadequacies, and to locate system deficiencies and specify remedies to correct such deficiencies. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the city in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report is requested within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the following information: 
(1)  A statement of the nature of the complaint, suspected deficiency or problem which precipitated the need for testing and assessment.

The consultant should sign all records of special tests which will confirm that the tests were performed in their presence and forward to the city such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken which would remedy problems or deficiencies uncovered during the course of such testing and assessments. Where said testing determines that problems, deficiencies, or violations of the franchise exist, franchising authority shall provide grantee with notice of said problems, deficiencies, or franchise violations and provide an appropriate time period for the grantee to cure said problem, deficiency or violation. 
(g)  The franchising authority's rights under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis, assessments and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on a sufficient number of complaints, suspected deficiencies or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the franchising authority has grounds to believe that the sufficient number of complaints, suspected deficiencies or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect cable system or multichannel video system subscribers against substandard cable service. 
(h)  The costs of conducting franchise performance evaluation sessions shall be borne by the grantor.

(a)  Initiation of proceedings by franchising authority. The franchising authority may, at its discretion, commence renewal proceedings during the six-month period beginning with the 36th month before the expiration date of the franchise. If the franchising authority seeks to initiate renewal proceedings, the franchising authority shall notify the grantee in writing, with delivery by certified United States mail, its desire to commence proceedings which affords the franchising authority the opportunity to identify future cable-related needs and interests and to review the performance of the grantee during the franchise term. Such notification shall not be made any later than the end of the 30th month prior to the expiration date of the franchise. 
(b)  Initiation of proceedings by grantee. Unless a request for franchise renewal proceedings is initiated by the franchising authority, the grantee shall be responsible for providing notification, in writing, to the franchising authority, delivered by certified United States mail, that it requests consideration of renewal of the franchise. Such notification shall be sent no sooner than the beginning of the 36th month prior to the expiration date of the franchise and not any later than the 30th month prior to the expiration date of the franchise to preserve the grantee's formal renewal rights under section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended. This section shall not prohibit the grantee from requesting franchise renewal before the beginning of the 36th month prior to the expiration date of the franchise, nor shall this section prohibit the franchising authority and the grantee from engaging in the informal renewal process. 
(c)  Application fee for renewal. The grantee shall provide to the franchising authority, with the request to initiate franchise renewal proceedings, a nonrefundable fee to be determined by the city council by resolution which shall be applied by the franchising authority to solely defray costs incurred by the franchising authority in initiating renewal procedures as outlined by section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, or any successor provision. 
(d)  Review proceedings. Proceedings for review shall be as follows: 
(1)  The franchising authority shall conduct a series of public meetings and hearings which shall address the following objectives:

(3)  During the course of such meetings and hearings, the franchising authority shall receive comments and testimony from the public with regard to the performance of the cable system or multichannel video system. At the completion of the proceedings, the franchising authority may determine whether or not the grantee was in reasonable compliance with the requirements set forth in the franchise ordinance or agreement. The franchising authority may also seek outside independent evaluations of the physical state of the cable system or multichannel video system, and of the payment of franchise fees or fees in-lieu of franchise fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement, as a part of its overall assessment of the performance of the grantee. 
(4)  Upon completion of the public meetings and hearings which have been called by the franchising authority, the franchising authority may, at its option, request the grantee to respond to a request for renewal proposal (RFRP) for renewal of the cable system or multichannel video system franchise by a specified date. Grantee shall cause the proposal to be delivered to the franchising authority by hand or by certified United States mail or an overnight package delivery service with a number of copies of the proposal to be provided as set forth in the RFRP document. 
(5)  The proposal submitted by the grantee shall, to the extent allowed by Section 624 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as now or hereinafter amended, or by any successor provision, provide such material as required by the franchising authority, including, but not limited to, improvements in the cable system or multichannel video system, services to be provided, and technical specifications to be met. 
(6)  The franchising authority shall, during the 120-day period from the date of the official receipt of the grantee's complete proposal, determine whether the franchise shall be renewed or if a preliminary assessment shall be made which would deny the grantee's request for renewal of the franchise. The franchising authority shall take into consideration the extent to which it believes the grantee to be in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of this article and the existing agreement, the degree to which the grantee has addressed future cable-related community needs and interests for the future in its proposal, and the grantee's financial and legal ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the proposal. Based on its review during the 120-day period, the franchising authority shall decide whether to renew the grantee's franchise and enter into negotiations with the grantee to determine terms and conditions for a new franchise. 
(7)  If the franchising authority issues a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed, the franchising authority shall commence an administrative proceeding, subject to the notice set forth in section 82-242. Such administrative proceeding shall be subject to the procedures and criteria as established by section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, or by any successor provision. 
(8)  Notwithstanding any other section of this division, a grantee may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise at any time, and the franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time, including after proceedings pursuant to this article have commenced. Such proceedings may allow the mayor or a committee to be appointed by the mayor or any other municipal officer, employee, or independent contractor to negotiate the terms and conditions of a renewal franchise agreement with the grantee. 
(9)  The city shall have the right to recoup from the grantee or succeeding grantee, if other than the grantee, all direct expenses incurred pursuant to renewal of the franchise, whether or not the franchise is renewed.

(b)  If the grantor believes that grounds for revocation exist or have existed, the grantor may notify the grantee in writing, setting forth the nature and facts of such noncompliance. If, within 30 days following such written notification, the grantee has not furnished reasonably satisfactory evidence that corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued or that the alleged violations did not occur or that the alleged violations were beyond the grantee's control, the matter shall be referred to the city council.

Further, the failure of a grantee to obtain financing or to pay any money due from it to any person, including the city, for whatever reason, shall not be an act or omission which is beyond the grantee's control. 
(e)  In the event that a franchise has been revoked by the city council, the city council shall have an option, to the extent then permitted by existing law, to purchase the tangible assets of the grantee's cable system or multichannel video system previously governed by the franchise at their depreciated value as defined herein. The city council may exercise this option to purchase any portion of the cable system or multichannel video system, including all books and records, private easements and assignable contracts. Unless some later date is agreed to by the grantee and except as provided in section 82-248 of this division, such an option must be exercised within one year from the date of revocation of the franchise, or the entry of a final judgment by a court reviewing the question of the city council's revocation, or the entry of a final order upon appeal of same, whichever is later. Upon determination by the city council that it intends to purchase the assets of the grantee's cable system or multichannel video system, the city council shall notify the grantee by certified United States mail of its desire and intent to acquire the assets of the cable system or multichannel video system from the grantee. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise has been revoked by the city council, the city council shall, to the extent then permitted by existing state and federal law, require sale of the cable system or multichannel video system at the fair market value determined on the basis of the cable system or multichannel video system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself by grantee to a successor person or group of persons, who, upon approval of the city council under the provisions of section 82-252 as stated hereinbelow, shall be granted a franchise to operate a cable system or multichannel video system within the franchise area.

Upon completion of termination and dismantling of the cable system or multichannel video system, grantee shall, upon direction of the city, restore any property, public or private, to the condition in which it existed prior to erection or construction of the cable system or multichannel video system, including any improvements made to such property subsequent to construction of the cable system or multichannel video system. Restoring of city property, including all public streets and public ways as defined herein, easements, parks, parkways, and other public lands, shall be in accordance with the directions and specifications of the city and all applicable laws. Grantee shall restore said public streets, public ways and properties at its expense. 
(h)  The termination of a grantee's rights under a franchise shall in no way affect any other rights the city may have under the franchise or under any provisions of law or ordinance. 
(i)  If a grantee arbitrarily and capriciously discontinues service to a substantial number of its subscribers, the grantee's franchise may be revoked by a resolution of the city council under the procedures as stated in this section following notice to the grantee and an opportunity to be heard. Notwithstanding section 82-242, notice to the grantee under this section may be less than 30 days, provided, further, the city may seek appropriate judicial or other relief and/or may proceed to exercise its rights and powers as provided for in this article.

Sec. 82-247. - Provision for arbitration. 
(a)  In the event the city pursues the option to purchase grantee's cable system or multichannel video system in an instance other than revocation, and the fair market value cannot be agreed upon, said value shall be determined by a panel of arbitrators who are professional cable system or multichannel video system valuators whose valuations have resulted in the sale of cable system or multichannel video systems, which panel may be requested by either the city of the grantee no sooner than 90 days after notice that the city desires to purchase the system. The panel shall be composed of one arbitrator chosen by the city, one arbitrator chosen by the grantee, and a third arbitrator chosen by the first two. The expenses of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators, shall be borne by the parties in such manner as the arbitrators provide in their decision. The determination of a majority of the arbitrators shall be binding on the parties only as to the value of the cable system or multichannel video system. The arbitrators shall follow the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association except where in conflict with an express provision of this article. The arbitration hearing shall take place in Cook County as the city shall determine unless otherwise agreed to by all parties in writing. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other timetable imposed by this article, the city shall, within 90 days following notice to it of the decision of the arbitrators, either withdraw any notice it may have given of its intent or election to acquire the grantee's system or shall affirmatively accept the decision of the arbitrators and affirm its election to purchase the system or assets. If the city fails to accept the arbitrators decision and affirm its election to purchase within the 90-day period, the rights of the city to purchase shall expire.

(a)  At all times from the expiration or revocation of a franchise and until either: 1) a grantee transfers to the city or other succeeding operator of the system all of its rights, title, and interest to all assets, real and personal, related to its cable television system, or 2) the city's right to acquire or assign its rights to acquire any of the grantee's assets expires without the city having exercised such a right, whichever occurs first, the grantee shall have a duty to such successor as a trustee holding such assets for the benefit of such success. The existing grantee shall continue to provide cable service to its subscribers in the same manner and with programming, customer service, and repair capabilities consistent with other operations of the grantee as it provided prior to the change in status of the franchise. The right of grantee to operate the cable system or multichannel video system in the event of revocation, expiration, or transfer of the franchise shall be considered by the franchising authority to be granted on a day-to-day basis until: the transfer or sale of the franchise to a successor grantee is completed and approved by the city. The grantee shall, at all times, operate the system in accordance with the terms of this article and the terms of the most recent previously existing franchise. In the event the grantee fails or refuses to operate the system as a trustee, the city shall have the option to name a successor trustee or operate the system itself as a trustee in accordance with the terms of this article and the terms of the franchise. 
(b)  For expiration or revocation of a franchise, this section shall not be construed to give a grantee any vested or other franchise right, but the right of the grantee in such circumstances shall exist only on a day-to-day basis until the transfer is effected. 
(c)  As full compensation for its ownership interests during this interim period, the grantee shall be entitled to receive the net profit, as defined in this article, generated during the period between the expiration or revocation of the franchise, as the case may be, and the transfer of the grantee's assets to the city or a successor.

If certain necessary records or documents cannot be made available at the location agreed to by the franchising authority, the franchising authority may, at its option, send its designee to the location where the grantee has stored such records. To the extent permitted by law, the grantee may be required to pay for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the franchising authority. Any additional amount due the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report or agreed-upon procedures report.

The city shall retain the right to reexamine insurance policy coverage limits and, where necessary, after consultation with the grantee, reasonably increase the coverage limits during the life of the franchise agreement or any extension thereto to ensure compliance with any risk management program to which the city belongs. 
(d)  Grantee shall maintain at its own expense, and by acceptance of a franchise be deemed to have agreed that it will maintain on deposit with the city, throughout the term of such franchise, and any extension thereof, a security fund in the form of a cash escrow or a letter of credit from a financial institution in the amount of $25,000.00 or such greater or lesser amount as may be specified in the franchise agreement. The form and content of such security fund escrow or letter of credit shall be approved by the Corporation Counsel. In particular, but without limitation, such escrow or letter of credit shall be drawn in the case of any default or failure of the grantee to pay any fees, penalties, claims, liens or taxes due the city under this article or the franchise. Upon drawing on such escrow or letter of credit for any reason, the city shall notify the grantee. The grantee shall, within three days of the receipt of such notification, take all action required to restore the security fund escrow or letter of credit to its original, full amount. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund escrow or letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund escrow or letter of credit shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(e)  All insurance policies, bonds, security fund escrows or letters of credit required by this section shall contain a provision requiring at least 30 days' written notice to both the city and the grantee of any cancellation, termination, or other expiration and shall provide that no such cancellation, termination or expiration shall be effective prior to such notice. Each such policy, bond, escrow and letter of credit must be approved by the city manager, and copies of such documents, along with written evidence of payment by the grantee of required premiums or fees, shall be filed and maintained with the city clerk. Notices of any renewal of any expiring policy or bond shall be filed with the city clerk at least 60 days prior to the date of such expiration. 
(f)  If the grantee proposes to secure a new insurance policy, bond or letter of credit (collectively referred to as the "instruments") instead of renewing an existing policy, bond or letter of credit, the grantee shall, at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of any such insurance policy, bond or letter of credit, submit to the city manager a copy of the proposed new instrument for the city manager's review. If the city manager finds that the instrument does not provide substantially the same indemnity or that it is procedurally defective, the city manager shall so notify the grantee and the grantee shall be obligated to reasonably cure the defect. Where an existing instrument reaches its expiration date, such proposed new instrument shall become effective only upon the expiration date of such expiring instrument if the city manager has approved the terms and coverage of such new instrument, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The grantee shall comply with all applicable provisions of this section as to any such instrument.

Such additional time for review shall be allowed upon agreement of a specific extension period by the franchising authority and the grantee. In the event that there is a violation, finding, or proceeding pending against the grantee, and such violation, finding, or pending proceeding is not concluded prior to the sale, transfer, or delegation, such responsibility for addressing such violations, findings, or proceedings shall inure to the buyer. The buyer shall be obligated for performance to no greater or lesser extent than the seller. 
(e)  No such approval of any agreement to sell, transfer, delegate, or assign shall be granted by the franchising authority unless all monies accruing to the city as of the date of sale, transfer, delegation or assignment, whether by way of fees, penalties, damages, or otherwise, have first been paid in full or are guaranteed to be paid out of the consideration received by the buyer, transferor, delegator, or assignor for such transaction. 
(f)  This section shall not apply to any sale, transfer, delegation, or assignment to one or more purchasers, transferees, delegees, or assignees who are controlled by, controlling, or under common control with the seller, transferor, delegator, or assignor. This section shall not apply to those proposed sales, transfers, delegations, or assignments of ownership of a cable system which are specifically exempted by the provisions of section 617 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or its successor provision. 
(g)  The consent of the city to any sale, transfer, lease, trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this article and the franchise. 
(h)  If the franchising authority rejects the application for transfer of the franchise to a proposed buyer, transferee, delegee, or assignee, the grantee may sell, transfer, delegate, or assign its rights under the franchise agreement notwithstanding such rejection, except that the grantee shall remain obligated to perform, cause the performance of or guarantee the performance of all obligations of the buyer, transferee, delegee, or assignee so identified.

(b)  Intent. In enacting this article, the city intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation: 
(1)  Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places; 
(2)  Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
(3)  Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property; 
(4)  Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities; 
(5)  Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces; 
(6)  Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed; 
(7)  Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the city's residential neighborhoods; 
(8)  Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and 
(9)  Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations. 
(c)  Facilities subject to this article. This article applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this article may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement. 
(d)  Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this article. 
(e)  Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. 
(1)  Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(2)  Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(f)  Conflicts with other articles. This article supersedes all articles or parts of articles adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict. 
(g)  Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this article to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations. 
(h)  Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this article when the city so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

(b)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(c)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt of a written request therefore from the city. 
(d)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Mayor and the City Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
    Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. 
(e)  Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(f)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(g)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

(Ord. No. 07-42, § 2, 11-27-2007) 
Sec. 82-395. - Security. 
(a)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the city director of community development, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city director of community development may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this act. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

Sec. 98-4. - Intent and purpose. 
    This chapter is adopted to: 
(1)  Ensure sound, harmonious subdivision development and community growth which will become a permanent asset by establishing minimum standards for design and construction. 
(2)  Ensure the development of land for the highest possible use with all the necessary protection against deterioration and obsolescence which would adversely affect the living environment or tax base. 
(3)  Provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working relationship between the city and the developer and to safeguard the interests of the homeowner, the subdivider, the investor and the city. 
(4)  Prevent scattered platting of lots beyond the existing public utilities and improvements. 
(5)  Cause the cost of design and installation of improvements in new, platted subdivisions to be borne by the persons purchasing the lots, rather than by any direct or indirect burden upon the existing property owners beyond the limits of the subdivision who have already paid for the improvements servicing their property. 
(6)  Bring about compact development of both the homes and the public improvements without the delay often experienced through future use of special assessment methods. 
(7)  Bring about the indirect effect of having dwellings erected on lots soon after the time of platting due to the investment of the developer in the public utilities and street facilities or within a short period of time thereafter as a result of posting of bond. 
(8)  Coordinate new subdivision design with the design of the city as a whole to allow for the proper capacity of all types of improvements on the basis of an orderly sequence of subdivisions as a part of neighborhoods and neighborhoods as a part of the community. 
(9)  Secure the rights of the public with respect to public lands and waters. 
(10)  Improve land records by establishing standards for surveys and plats. 
(11)  Ensure compatibility and uniformity of lots within established subdivisions.

(b)  This chapter shall also apply to all planned developments, whether residential, commercial, or otherwise in nature, and to any other developments whether a subdivision is required or not under the law, statutes, ordinances or regulations of the governmental body or agency having jurisdiction or control, and regardless of whether such is labeled a subdivision or not, it being the intent of this chapter to apply to all types of development, both within the city and to areas lying within 11/2 miles of the corporate limits. 
(Code 1967, § 18-3) 
Sec. 98-6. - Scope. 
(a)  Whenever any subdivision of land shall be laid out, the subdivider thereof or his agent shall submit a preliminary and a final subdivision plat to the planning and zoning commission. Such plats and plans of proposed improvements and all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance with this chapter. 
(b)  Until plats and plans for the subdivision are approved, properly signed and recorded: 
(1)  No land shall be subdivided nor shall any street be laid out nor shall any improvements be made to the natural land. 
(2)  No lot, tract, or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be offered for sale nor shall any sale, contract for sale or option be made or given. 
(3)  No improvements such as sidewalks, water supply, stormwater drainage, sanitary sewer facilities, gas service, electric service or lighting, grading, paving or surfacing of streets shall be made by any owner or his agent or by any public service corporation at the request of such owner or his agent. 
(c)  All lands offered to the city for use as streets, alleys, schools, parks, and other public uses shall be referred to the planning and zoning commission for review and recommendation before being accepted by the city council or by any other governing authority of the city. 
(d)  No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains poor drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the city engineer, make the area safe for residential occupancy, and provide adequate lot and street drainage, the plat of the subdivision may be approved. See subsection 98-132(a)(14). 
(e)  In all subdivisions due regard shall be given to the preservation of historical sites and natural features such as large trees, watercourses and scenic views. 
(f)  For preliminary plats for parts of tracts, where it appears necessary to the planning and zoning commission for the satisfactory overall development of an area, an owner may be required to prepare at least a street plan of his entire tract based upon proper topographic surveys before approval of any portion of such plan. 
(g)  Whenever an area is subdivided into lots of 40,000 square feet or more which may at a later date be resubdivided, consideration shall be given to the street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional minor streets can be located which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.

Sec. 98-101. - Preapplication procedure. 
(a)  Preapplication conference. Prior to the filing of an application for approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the planning and zoning commission plans and data in sketch form and as specified in division 3 of this article. This step does not require formal application, fee or filing of the plat. 
(b)  Advice to subdivider. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the planning and zoning commission and to consult early and informally with the planning and zoning commission staff or consultant before preparation of the preliminary plat and before formal application for its approval, in order to save time and money and to make the most of his opportunities. 
(c)  Notification. Within 90 days the planning and zoning commission shall inform the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not meet the objectives of this chapter. When the planning and zoning commission finds the plans and data do not meet the objectives of this chapter, it shall express its reasons therefor. 
(Code 1967, § 18-29; Ord. No. 17-19, § 8, 6-13-2017) 
Sec. 98-102. - Procedure for conditional approval of preliminary plat. 
(a)  Preparation. On reaching conclusions informally by the preapplication conference regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in division 3 of this article. If a proposed subdivision is three acres or less in area, the subdivider shall have the right to dispense with preparation of the preliminary plat and to proceed directly with submission of the final plat. In such case, the fee of subsection (c) of this section shall be payable upon submission of the final plat. 
(b)  Submission. An application in writing with one reproducible vellum or mylar and 20 folded paper copies of the preliminary plat shall be filed with the public works director or his designee at the city hall at least 30 days prior to the regular meeting at which the plat is to be considered. The planning and zoning commission secretary will forward copies of the application with prints to the planning and zoning commission chairman and members of the planning and zoning commission, the city engineer, the city fire chief, the director of public works, and the city manager. 
    The planning and zoning commission secretary shall determine whether the preliminary plat is in proper form. The planning and zoning commission shall not receive or consider the application as filed until all documents are in accordance with the requirements set in this section. 
(c)  Fees. At the time of filing for conditional approval of the preliminary plat, the application shall be accompanied by a fee in accordance with the schedule of rates, fees, fines and penalties as adopted by the city council from time to time and found in appendix B to this Code. 
(d)  General factors for consideration. The planning and zoning commission will study the preliminary plat in connection with division 3 of this article, the official plan, including the major street plan, chapter 122 and the topography of the area, and will take into consideration the general requirements of the community, the particular requirements of the neighborhood, and the best use of the land to be subdivided. Particular attention will be given to specific requirements for parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street connections and the suitability of the land for development. The preliminary plat will also be subject to check and comments to be submitted in writing within 30 days to the planning and zoning commission by the boards and officers listed in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Planning and zoning commission hearing. After receipt of an application and the filing of all the required data and fees, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing. Notice shall be given of the time and place of the hearing not more than 30 and not less than 15 days before the hearing by publishing a notice thereof in a newspaper having a general circulation within the city. The applicant shall make written notification by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all property owners or tax bill recipients of property within 250 feet including rights-of-way, stating the date, time, place and nature of the hearing request. This notification is to be not less than 15 and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing. Notification to condominiums need not be mailed to each condominium unit, provided the notification is sent to the board of directors of the condominium association in care of the association president. Certified mail, return receipts (green cards) are to be submitted to the community development department no later than 48 hours prior to the hearing along with a map depicting the properties within the service area. Accompanying the return receipts shall be a sworn statement as to the source of the names and addresses notified. 
(f)  Planning and zoning commission conditional approval. Following review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted for conformity thereof to this chapter and negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by him, the planning and zoning commission shall, within 30 days, act thereon as submitted or modified, and if approved, the planning and zoning commission shall express its approval as a conditional approval and shall state the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved shall express its disapproval and its reason therefor. 
(g)  Notification. The action of the planning and zoning commission shall be noted on three copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy forwarded with a report to the city council and the other retained by the planning and zoning commission. 
(h)  Meaning of conditional approval. Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be submitted for approval of the planning and zoning commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of this chapter and the conditions of the conditional approval, if any. 
(i)  City council conditional approval. The city council shall, within 30 days, upon receipt of the preliminary plat and report from the planning and zoning commission, upon motion and majority vote, conditionally approve or disapprove the preliminary plat and notify the planning and zoning commission and subdivider of its action. 
(j)  Effective period of conditional approval. Conditional approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum period of 12 months, except that submission within this period of a final plat applying to a portion of the area covered by the preliminary plat shall extend the effective period of conditional approval to a maximum of 24 months from the date of submission of the preliminary plat. If a final plat has not been submitted to the planning and zoning commission within these time limits, the planning and zoning commission may require that the preliminary plat shall again be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for conditional approval.

Sec. 98-103. - Procedure for approval of final plat. 
(a)  Submission. After approval of the subdivision preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission and fulfillment of the required conditions as provided in division 3 of this article, the subdivider shall apply for approval of a final plat. The application for approval shall be submitted in writing to the director of public works at least 30 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The application shall be in quadruplicate and shall be accompanied by the original inked plat on tracing cloth or vellum, one Van Dyke or sepia reproduction and 20 folded prints. The original and 20 paper copies are also to be accompanied by an electronic file media in a format compatible with the city's CAD capabilities and as approved by the public works director or his designee. Specifications for the plat and for other documents to accompany the application are given in division 3 of this article. The final plat will not be considered as submitted unless in agreement with specifications and accompanied by required documents. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at the time; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Planning and zoning commission action. Within 45 days after submission the planning and zoning commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If the planning and zoning commission approves, such approval shall be entered upon the tracings by the signatures of the chairman and secretary of the planning and zoning commission. The tracings shall then be transmitted to the city council by the planning and zoning commission with recommendation for council approval. If the planning and zoning commission disapproves, it shall set forth its reasons in its own records and provide the applicant with a copy. 
(c)  City council action. Within 30 days after receiving the final plat from the planning and zoning commission, the city council shall take action. If the council approves, such approval shall be entered upon the tracings by the signatures of the mayor and city clerk. Approval by the council shall be by resolution setting forth all conditions upon which approval is predicated. If the council disapproves, it shall set forth its reasons in its own records and provide the applicant and planning and zoning commission with a copy. 
(d)  Filing. The city attorney or city clerk shall record the plat with the county recorder of deeds after approval by the city council and after request of the subdivider that the plat be recorded. After acceptance of the plat by the city, but prior to the recording the plat, the subdivider shall pay to the city the required filing fee in addition to all costs and attorney's fees incurred for the filing of the plat. No building permit shall be issued nor shall any construction be started until evidence of recording has been delivered to the public works director or his designee. A sepia tracing shall be returned to the planning and zoning commission for filing. Appropriate notifications shall be given the planning and zoning commission and the subdivider advising council approval or disapproval and advising document numbers after recording. 
(e)  Approval not acceptance of improvements. Approval of the final plat shall not be deemed to constitute or effect any acceptance by the city of any improvement shown on the plat. 
(f)  Failure to record plat. Unless a plat of subdivision approved by the city council is recorded with the county recorder of deeds within two years of the date of city council approval, the approval of the plat automatically expires without further action of the city council. Thereafter, the plat shall be of no force and effect.

DIVISION 4. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 98-161. - General principles of acceptability. 
(a)  Conformance to official plan. The subdivision shall conform to the official plan or the portions thereof existing and shall not encroach upon areas designated in the official plan for future public facilities. 
(b)  Neighborhood plan. If a suggested plan for the neighborhood or area in which the tract to be subdivided is located has been made by the planning and zoning commission, the street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformance thereto. 
(c)  Provision for future subdivision. If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision. 
(Code 1967, § 18-55; Ord. No. 17-19, § 13, 6-13-2017) 
Sec. 98-162. - Streets. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets in the subdivision shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets in conformance with the city's official plan. Whenever a subdivision embraces a major street, as shown on the major street plan, such major street shall be platted in the location and of the width indicated on the major street plan. 
(b)  The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding area; or 
(2)  Meet a particular situation where topographical, drainage or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(c)  Minor residential streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(d)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major highway or interstate highway, the planning and zoning commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatments as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(e)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning and zoning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, for park purposes in residence districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined also with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(f)  The spacing between minor street to major street intersections shall be a minimum of 660 feet, centerline to centerline. 
(g)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 75 degrees. 
(h)  Surface grading at street intersections shall be such as to permit unrestricted vision within the sight triangles as determined per chapter 114, section 114-37(b)(1). 
(i)  Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other requirements of this chapter, and where the city engineer finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half or partial street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(j)  Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently (culs-de-sac), shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 90 feet, a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. Where an existing street terminates at the boundary line of a proposed subdivision, either the street shall be continued in the street pattern of the proposed subdivision or a turnaround shall be provided in the proposed subdivision. 
(k)  No subdivision name or street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets within or near the city. Street names shall be selected by the subdivider subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission. 
(l)  If deemed necessary by the city engineer for vehicular traffic safety acceleration and/or deceleration lanes shall be added on major streets with the right-of-way width being increased accordingly.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 00-14, § 26, adopted May 9, 2000, repealed § 98-163 in its entirety. Formerly said section pertained to alley design standards. See the Code Comparative Table. 
Sec. 98-164. - Easements. 
(a)  Specifications. In a subdivision, all utilities shall be placed on rear or side property lines and shall be designed to provide continuity from block to block. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, an appropriate easement shall be provided for the watercourse, as determined by the city engineer. Where water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, gas mains, telephone lines, power lines, or other utilities are located on or adjacent to property lines, adequate easements, in the form set forth in subsection (c) of this section, together with right of ingress or egress thereto and therefrom, shall be provided and platted. Easements for gas mains, telephone lines, power lines, cable television or other utilities shall not be less than ten feet in width and centered upon the centerline of the utility. Easements for water mains, storm sewers or sanitary sewers shall not be less than 15 feet in width and centered upon the centerline of the utility. If the burial depth of the watermain, storm sewer or sanitary sewer exceeds ten feet, the width of the easement shall be increased to 20 feet. Where more than one utility is to occupy the easement, the easement shall be of such width as to extend five feet at each side beyond the centerline of the outermost utilities. Additional width shall be provided where necessary to accommodate utility pole bracing. The planning and zoning commission may require evidence of approval by the public utility company of easement width. Where side lot easements occur adjacent to a driveway, there shall not be less than five feet clearance between the easement line and the extreme projection of the building structure. 
(b)  Grant to cable television company required. Each plat of subdivision shall contain a grant of easement to any cable television company with which the city has executed a valid franchise agreement and shall be in the form set forth in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Easement language. 
(1)  Electric and telephone. A permanent, nonexclusive easement for serving the subdivision and other property with electric and communication service is reserved for and granted to any electric, telephone and/or communication company authorized by the city (referred to as "grantees"), jointly and severally, to install, operate, maintain and remove, from time to time, facilities used in connection with underground transmission and distribution of electricity and sounds and signals in, under, across, along and upon the surface of the property known as and/or labeled as utility easement, utility and drainage easement, or utility and landscaping easement within dashed lines on the attached plat of subdivision and property designated on the plat for streets and alleys, together with the right to install required service connections under the surface of each lot to serve improvements thereon; the right to cut, trim or remove trees, bushes and roots as may be reasonably required incident to the rights given in this section; and the right to enter upon the subdivided property for all such purposes. Obstructions shall not be placed over the grantees' facilities or in, upon or over such easements without prior written consent of the grantees. Such facilities shall generally be located underground and, after installation of any such facilities, the grade of the subdivided property shall not be altered in a manner so as to interfere with the proper operation and maintenance thereof. The location of facilities by the grantees shall not conflict or interfere with public improvements, and any conflicts in use shall be subject to resolution and approval by the city. 
(2)  Gas. A permanent, nonexclusive easement for serving the subdivision and other property with gas is reserved and granted to any natural gas company authorized by the city in all platted easement areas, streets, alleys and other public ways and places shown on this plat; such easement to be for the installation, maintenance, relocation, renewal and removal of gas mains and appurtenances for the purpose of serving all areas shown on this plat as well as other property, whether or not contiguous thereto. No buildings or other structures shall be constructed or erected in any such easement areas, streets, alleys or other public ways or places. All such gas mains and appurtenances shall be generally located underground, and the use of the easements shall not conflict or interfere with public improvements, and any conflicts in use shall be subject to resolution and approval by the city. 
(3)  Cable television. A permanent, nonexclusive easement is reserved for and granted to the city and/or to any cable television company authorized by the city to install cable television facilities within the subdivision (referred to as the "company") and to their successors and assigns in, upon, across, under and through the areas shown and/or labeled as "utility easement" within dashed lines on the attached plat of subdivision for the purpose of installing, constructing, inspecting, operating, replacing, renewing, altering, enlarging, removing, repairing and maintaining cable television lines or appurtenances and, without limitation, such other installations as may be required to furnish cable television service to the attached area and such appurtenances and additions thereto as the city and the company may deem necessary, together with the right of access across the easements included in the attached plat for the necessary men and equipment to do any and all of such work. The right is also granted to the city and the company to cut down, trim or remove any trees, shrubs or other plants that interfere with the operation of or access to such lines in, on, upon, across, under or through such easements. No permanent buildings or trees shall be placed on such easements, but some may be used for gardens, shrubs, landscaping and other purposes that do not then or later interfere with such uses and rights. Such facilities shall generally be located underground, and the use of such easement shall not conflict or interfere with public improvements, and any conflicts in use shall be subject to resolution and approval by the city. 
(4)  Sewers and drainage. A permanent, nonexclusive easement is reserved for and granted to the city and to its successors and assigns in, upon, across, over, under and through the areas shown as and/or labeled as "utility easement" or as "utility and drainage easement" or as "utility and landscaping easement" or as "stormwater management easement" within dashed lines on the attached plat of subdivision for the purpose of installing, constructing, inspecting, operating, replacing, renewing, altering, enlarging, removing, repairing, cleaning and maintaining sanitary sewers, storm sewers, ditches, swales, water mains and any and all manholes, hydrants, pipes, connections, catchbasins, buffalo boxes and, without limitation, such other installations as may be required to furnish water, sanitary sewer and stormwater storage and drainage for the attached area and such appurtenances and additions thereto as the city may deem necessary, together with the right of access across the easement included in the attached plat for the necessary personnel and equipment to do any or all of such work. The right is also granted to do any or all of such work. The right is also granted to the city cut down, trim or remove any trees, shrubs or other plants that interfere with the operations of or access to such facilities, in, on, upon, across, under or through such easements. No permanent buildings or trees shall be placed on such easements, but some may be used for gardens, shrubs, landscaping and other purposes that do not then or later interfere with such uses and rights; provided, however, that such use of such easements shall not conflict or interfere with public improvements, and any conflicts in use shall be subject to the approval of the city. If the city enters upon any easement for the purposes stated in this section, the city shall be responsible only for restoring the grade of and seeding the affected area. 
Unless otherwise specifically directed by the city, the respective lot owners shall be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management facilities, the control of erosion and maintenance of such permitted landscaping, including grass within those portions of any easements which are part of their respective premises, as indicated on the plat of subdivision. If a lot owner fails to fulfill such responsibilities, the city may but shall not be obligated to fulfill such responsibilities. The city may record the costs, including attorneys' fees, as a lien against the title of the lot. The city may initiate legal proceedings to foreclose such lien and may, in addition or in the alternative, bring action at law against the owner of record of the delinquent lot. 
(Code 1967, § 18-58; Ord. No. 00-14, § 27, 5-9-2000; Ord. No. 17-19, § 15, 6-13-2017)

(4)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(b)  The maximum lengths of blocks may be permitted up to 1,800 feet. Blocks over 800 feet may require pedestrian easements. Pedestrian easements not less than 12 feet in width shall be provided where deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission. The use of additional pedestrian easements in any instance to provide safe and convenient access to schools, parks, shopping areas, or other similar destinations may be recommended by the planning and zoning commission. The minimum length of blocks shall be 400 feet. 
(c)  Blocks intended for industrial or commercial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose, with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading. 
(d)  It is preferred that blocks adjacent to major streets be so arranged that the long dimension of the block will be parallel to the major street and that lots do not front on or have access to the major street. Where this arrangement is not feasible, frontage streets may be required. 
(Code 1967, § 18-59; Ord. No. 17-19, § 16, 6-13-2017) 
Sec. 98-166. - Lots. 
(a)  The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. Every lot must contain a suitable building site. 
(b)  Lot dimensions and areas shall conform to the requirements of chapter 122, where applicable, but in no case shall a lot for residential purposes in a new subdivision be less than 60 feet wide at the building line or less than 7,800 square feet in area. The area of the street right-of-way shall not be included in calculating the area of the lot in accordance with the minimum lot area requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
(c)  Residential lots served by septic systems shall be a minimum of 100 feet wide at the building line and shall have a minimum area and depth as determined by specification for seepage systems recommended by the county department of public health, provided, further, that no such lot shall have an area less than one acre (43,560 square feet). 
(d)  Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. The maximum depth of any lot, exclusive of unusable land, shall be 31/2 times the width of the lot. 
(e)  Every lot shall abut on a dedicated and improved street for at least 25 feet except in a planned development as provided in article IV of chapter 122. 
(f)  Minimum setback lines from property lines in residential zones shall conform with the zoning regulations, except that there shall be a side yard along each lot line of a width not less than ten feet, and front yard setbacks shall apply to both streets of a corner lot. 
(g)  Corner lots in residential zones shall be considered as having frontage on both streets and shall be increased in width to conform with minimum setback lines on both streets. 
(h)  Sidelines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the street line. 
(i)  Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have additional minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site and afford the minimum usable area required in chapter 122 for front, rear, and side yards. 
(j)  Where lots front upon a cul-de-sac or curved road or street having a radius of 200 feet or less, the minimum width of the frontage at the lot may be measured at the building line. 
(k)  No lot shall be established between a proposed road and adjacent property for the implied purpose of requiring the adjacent owner to share in the cost of the street improvements nor to prevent or limit access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use. 
(l)  Additionally, the consolidating or combining of lots within established subdivisions must consider the resulting lot's size and proportion to other lots within the subdivision.

All engineering plans shall be submitted on 24 inch by 36 inch sheets and shall bear the signature and seal of the state-registered professional engineer under whose directions they were prepared. 
(b)  Submission. Upon receipt of the final plans, the community development director shall cause their review by the city engineer and director of public works to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The city engineer may, at his discretion, confer with the design engineer concerning correction or clarification of the final plans. In addition to the paper copies of final plans, the subdivider shall submit final approved plans on an electronic file media prescribed by the community development director. 
(c)  Permission to proceed required. Specific permission of the community development director, via permit, shall be secured before commencement of construction of any improvement. No substantial deviations from the approved plans and specifications will be allowed without the written permission of the city engineer. Field changes may be allowed by the city engineer. The subdivider shall also secure any permission or permits required by law of state; county or other applicable governmental officials and permission extended by the city council shall not relieve the subdivider of responsibility to secure such other approvals. If the subdivider elects to construct an improvement prior to approval of the final plat, the city council may extend permission to proceed upon recommendation of the city engineer and community development director together with certification by the community development director that working drawings and specifications have been approved and that engineering fees have been paid and that the inspection bond and performance guarantees have been posted. 
(d)  Qualification of contractors. The developer shall make available to the community development director a list of all contractors and subcontractors who are to participate in construction of public improvements. Such contractors and subcontractors shall be subject to the appropriate licensing provisions of this Code and shall be subject to disqualification because of faulty performance upon past construction work done in the city. 
(e)  Notification and required inspections. The subdivider or his contractor shall notify the community development department at least 48 hours in advance of initial work on an improvement and shall schedule required inspections at least 24 hours in advance of the inspection. Required inspections include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: proof roll of street subgrade, underground utility installation, placing of concrete and laying of bituminous concrete pavement courses. 
(Code 1967, § 18-72; Ord. No. 00-14, §§ 29-31, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 98-227. - Guarantee of completion and maintenance. 
    The final plat of subdivision shall not be recorded until the subdivider has completed all required public improvements or guarantee the completion of all required improvements and has guaranteed to maintain the improvement for a period of one year following satisfactory installation of the improvement. This guarantee shall be by either one or a combination of the following methods; only one method shall be applied to a specific improvement: 
(1)  Surety bond. The subdivider may post a surety bond or other security as provided by this article or as authorized by state statute in a form approved by the city attorney. The amount of the bond or other security shall be not less than 115 percent of the final estimate of cost of the improvement, as estimated by the city engineer under section 98-229. There shall be no reduction in the amount of that portion of the bond applying to a particular improvement unless and until that improvement is complete and accepted or approved by the city engineer and the community development director. Each such bond is deemed to contain the following provisions, whether such provisions are inserted in such bond or not: 
The principal and sureties on this bond agree that all the undertakings, covenants, terms, conditions and agreements of the contract or contracts entered into between the principal and the city will be performed and fulfilled, and to pay all persons, firms and corporations having contracts with the principal or with subcontractors, all just claims due them under the provisions of such contracts for labor performed or materials furnished in the performance of the contract on account of which this bond is given, if such claims are not satisfied out of the contract price of the contract on account of which this bond is given, after final settlement between the city and the principal has been made. 
(2)  Irrevocable letter of credit. The subdivider may post an irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the city attorney. The amount of the letter of credit shall be not less than 115 percent of the final estimate of cost of the improvement as estimated by the city engineer under section 98-229. Reductions in the amount of a letter of credit shall only be by approval of the city attorney conditioned upon the following: 
a.  The installation of an improvement or improvements for which a reduction is requested must be approved by the city engineer and community development director. 
b.  For full improvement installation the amount of the reduction shall not exceed 85 percent of the guarantee's value assigned to that improvement. 
c.  For partial improvement installation the amount of the reduction shall not exceed 75 percent of the guarantee value assigned to the installed improvement. A partial reduction request may be rejected if it is determined by the city engineer that damage or unreasonable wear will result to the improvement or other improvements as a result of the partial completion. 
(3)  Cash bond. The subdivider may deposit a cash bond with the city in accordance with a specific escrow agreement approved by the city attorney and community development director and in an amount not less than 115 percent of the final estimate of cost of the improvements as estimated by the city engineer under section 98-229. The deposit shall be held in a special account by the city, and the agreement may provide for partial payouts as work progresses in amounts recommended by the city engineer and approved by the community development director as corresponding to the original estimate of unit costs. Partial payouts shall be contingent upon favorable inspection reports, and the sum of partial payouts for a single improvement shall not exceed 85 percent of the original deposit for the improvement until and unless the improvement is complete and accepted or approved by the city council. 
(4)  Cash deposit. The subdivider shall deposit cash with the city to guarantee the repair, correction or replacement of any improvement not properly completed or destroyed or damaged after installation and prior to acceptance of the subdivision improvements by the city proposed in section 98-228. The cash deposit shall pertain to the following but is not limited thereto: cleanup; buffalo box repair or adjustment to proper level; sidewalk, curb or street damage repair; tree plantings and water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer extension. The cash deposit required by this subsection is as follows: (i) $50.00 per lot for a single-family dwelling, (ii) $20.00 per unit for a multifamily dwelling, (iii) $50.00 per acre for commercial and industrial property. The maximum cash deposit for each classification shall be $5,000.00. The cash deposit shall be held in a special account by the city. After the area is complete, the city engineer shall present the subdivider with a written list of necessary repairs and corrections. If this work is not done within 30 days of notice by the city engineer to the subdivider, the city will make the correction and repairs and the cost thereof will be deducted from the cash deposit. 
(5)  Alternate improvement method. The subdivider may, for subdivisions of not to exceed ten acres for residential subdivisions and not to exceed 20 acres for industrial subdivisions that are contiguous and adjacent to a previously improved subdivision, provide the following materials as proof of intent to install and maintain required improvements: 
a.  Proof of ownership of the land to be subdivided, approved by the city attorney. 
b.  A photographic copy of the contract between the subdivider and his subcontractors in which the city is named as the beneficiary of the public improvements, as specified, plus the requirements of subsection (5)f. of this section. 
c.  A letter of guarantee from the owner of the subject land to the subcontractors of the subdivider that the owner will pay for all public improvements of the entire subdivision if the subdivider defaults. 
d.  A letter from the owner and the subdivider of the subject land guaranteeing maintenance of the properly completed public improvements for the period of one year from the date of completion thereof. 
e.  A performance bond, letter of credit or other security from the subcontractor or contractor installing the public improvements, subject to the approval of the city attorney. 
f.  The contract between the subdivider and his subcontractors shall provide that the subcontractors shall maintain the public improvements for one year from the date of completion, as provided in this section, and that the subcontractors shall provide a maintenance bond for that period equal to 100 percent of the value of the improvements, or the subdivider shall turn over to the city a sum equal to 15 percent of the total value of the improvements to be used by the city for maintenance or paid to the subcontractors if, on certification of the city engineer, the improvements have been properly maintained for one year by the subcontractors. 
(6)  Project completion. The city shall refund a cash bond to the subdivider or release the irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond within 60 days after the subdivider notifies the city in writing of the completion of the project improvements for which the security was required. For this purpose, "completion" means that the city has determined that the project improvement for which the security was required is complete or a licensed engineer or licensed architect has certified to the subdivider and the city that the project improvement has been completed in compliance with the applicable codes and ordinances of the city. The city shall pay interest to the subdivider, beginning 60 days after the subdivider notifies the city in writing of the completion of the project improvement, on any security not refunded to the subdivider, at the rate of one percent per month. 
(Code 1967, § 18-73; Ord. No. 00-14, §§ 32-37, 5-9-2000; Ord. No. 01-50, § 1, 12-18-2001) 
Sec. 98-228. - Inspection. 
(a)  Required. All improvements in a subdivision shall be subject to inspection by the city engineer both during the course of construction and after construction is complete. The city engineer shall have authority over materials of construction, methods of construction and workmanship to ensure compliance with work drawings and specifications. The contractor shall provide for reasonable field and laboratory tests and proof of quality of materials as requested by the city engineer. Upon due cause the city engineer may require that work be suspended, and due cause shall include weather conditions, questionable materials of construction, methods of construction, workmanship or nonadherence to specifications and drawings. Required inspections shall include but are not necessarily limited to the following: proof rolling of roadway, subgrade, underground utilities, placement of concrete, laying of bituminous concrete pavement, grading and street lighting. 
(b)  Inspection reports. The city engineer shall prepare and submit to the community development director each month a report stating the progress of the work and giving his findings as to quality and quantity of materials used and quality of methods and workmanship. He shall in particular call attention to any circumstances that entail departures from working drawings and specifications such as unforeseen difficulties of drainage, groundwater, poor subsoil, unstable fill material, unconventional or faulty practices of contractors or other circumstances. Whenever, in his opinion, such departures are likely to cause either a lower ultimate standard of performance or a higher construction cost than could reasonably be anticipated, he shall immediately notify the community development director. When an improvement has been completed he shall prepare a summary report. The summary report shall be dated, signed and one copy each prepared for the subdivider, community development director and the city council. 
(c)  Subdivider responsibility. Approval by the city engineer or absence of inspection shall in no way relieve the subdivider of full responsibility for adherence by his contractors to specifications and working drawings nor for high standard of materials, methods and workmanship. The subdivider shall be responsible for providing, at his expense, any third party inspection reports as requested by the city engineer. 
(d)  Approval not acceptance. Approval by the city engineer shall not be deemed acceptance of the public improvement by the city. Acceptance shall be only by action of the city manager, and acceptance shall be contingent upon a favorable inspection report. 
(Code 1967, § 18-74; Ord. No. 00-14, §§ 38-41, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 98-229. - Fees.

(b)  Administrative and permit fees. To offset the administrative cost associated with administration of this chapter by the community development department, the subdivider shall pay fees in accordance with the fee schedule set forth in appendix B of this Code. 
(c)  Recapture fees. The subdivider shall pay any applicable recapture fees as required by ordinance. 
(Code 1967, § 18-75; Ord. No. 00-14, § 42, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 98-230. - Maintenance and final acceptance. 
(a)  Subdivider's responsibility for maintenance of improvements. As further assurance of serviceable construction and to provide for repair of damage resulting from subsequent construction operations of the subdivider or his contractors, the subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance of an improvement for a period of 12 months from the satisfactory completion of an entire improvement as determined by the city engineer or community development director. The guarantee of completion and maintenance shall recognize the possibility of maintenance costs, and the terms of the guarantee shall provide for reimbursement to the city for any maintenance expenses incurred by the city in performing maintenance work after failure of the subdivider to perform such work upon due notice. Sale of a parcel or lot does not relieve the subdivider of the responsibility to maintain the improvements adjacent to the lot in accordance with this section. 
(b)  Guarantee for maintenance of improvements. The contract between the subdivider and his subcontractors shall provide that the subcontractor shall maintain their installed improvement for a period of one year from the date of completion as determined by the city engineer. The subdivider shall provide a maintenance guarantee to the city in a form approved by the city attorney and equal to at least 15 percent of the improvement cost. Said guarantee shall be used by the city for maintenance failed to be performed by the subdivider of his contractor. 
(c)  Protection and repair of existing improvements. The subdivider, his contractors and suppliers shall be jointly and severally responsible that existing improvements and the property of the city are not damaged or rendered less useful or unsightly by the operations of the subdivider, his contractors or suppliers. This subsection is intended to include damage or nuisance with respect to the land, improvements or landscaping of the city; damage to existing streets, sidewalks, curb and gutter, parkways by passage thereover of equipment or trucks or by excavation for any purpose; the spillage or tracking of earth, sand or rock onto existing streets, sidewalks, curb and gutter or parkways; the washing by stormwater of earth or sand onto streets, sidewalks, curb and gutter or parkways or into catchbasins; damage to water mains, sanitary sewers, culverts or storm sewers. To reduce or localize the possibility of damage to streets by heavy trucking, the director of public works, with approval of the city engineer, shall instruct the subdivider as to the streets to be used for access to the subdivision by equipment and trucks, and the subdivider shall be responsible for enforcement of this instruction upon his contractors and their suppliers. The subdivider shall make provision to prevent damaging or washing of earth or sand onto sidewalks, streets, curb and gutter and into catchbasins by stormwater. When deemed advisable, the director of public works shall have the power to require, either prior to commencement of construction or after construction is in process, that the subdivider post surety to guarantee repair of damages or abatement of nuisances. Where need for surety becomes apparent after construction is in progress, the director of public works shall have the power to order construction discontinued until surety has been posted. Expenses incurred by the city in repairing damages and in cleaning streets, catchbasins and sewers shall be deducted from the surety. 
(d)  Acceptance. Acceptance of an improvement shall be by approval of the city manager upon recommendation of the city engineer and community development director. Acceptance of an improvement shall constitute release of the applicable portion of the performance bond or of the applicable portion of the balance of cash deposit. Recommendation shall be contingent upon the following: 
(1)  Fulfillment of the requirements of subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section. 
(2)  An opinion of the city attorney that satisfactory and proper conveyances have been made by the subdivider to the city. 
(3)  Improvement being complete and in good repair in accordance with city standards and requirements. 
(4)  Inspection reports, including but not limited to television inspection of all sanitary and storm sewers as required by sections 98-269 and 98-270, indicating compliance with working drawings and specifications.

The submittal shall be on a reproducible mylar or vellum with four paper copies and must be sealed by an engineer or surveyor licensed in the State of Illinois and also be placed on an electronic media in DXF file format. The drawings shall include one foot contours, first floor elevations, all rim and invert elevations of all underground structures, actual pipe lengths, location of water and sanitary service lines and any field changes approved by the city engineer. 
(6)  Completion of a single improvement throughout the subdivision as indicated in the final plat and working drawings. A single improvement shall not be accepted in part. The subgrade, base course and surface course of a street, alley or parking area shall be considered as a single improvement. 
(e)  Effect of other regulations. None of the sections of this chapter pertaining to permission, surety, fees, acceptance and approval shall be construed as exempting subdividers, general contractors, subcontractors or any other contractor or craftsman from any other section of this Code or city ordinance or regulation with respect to licenses, fees, surety, inspection or other control.

DIVISION 4. - RECAPTURE 

Sec. 98-280. - General. 
    Wherever: 
(1)  A municipal ordinance of the city requires the installation of any water mains, sanitary sewers or storm drains; and 
(2)  In the opinion of the city council such facilities may be used for the benefit of additional property not controlled by the person of whom an installation is required; and 
(3)  Such water mains, sanitary sewers and storm drains are to be dedicated to the public. 
The corporate authorities may, by ordinance, require that additional property benefitted by such facilities not be permitted to develop or connect to the facilities unless a fair and reasonable portion of certified costs of installation are reimbursed to the installing party. Installation cost, as determined by the city engineer, shall include the following and no others; actual construction costs (material, labor, equipment and overhead associated with the contract to install) and engineering fees equaling not more than three percent of the installation cost applicable to the recapture. 
A property is considered benefitted if the improvement fronts the property, otherwise serves the property, or is oversized and/or deepened beyond what would be required to serve just the developed property. 
The installing party has a maximum of one years' time, from the time of the placement of the public utility that was installed into operation, to make a formal written request to the city council to establish a recapture agreement, by ordinance. Recapture agreements shall have a term of ten years. Upon the completion of said ten-year term, the installing party may request one extension, up to five years, if justification can be provided that additional development or utility connections are likely to occur within the time frame of said extension.

    The city council shall have the sole authority to determine the following: 
(1)  The benefitted properties. 
(2)  The costs eligible for the recapture. 
(3)  The method by which the costs are to be determined and certified. 
(4)  The amount of interest, if any, which may be charged to a benefitted property owner (not to exceed ten percent simple interest per annum). 
(Ord. No. 00-14, § 71, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 98-282. - Methodology. 
    The city engineer will use the following methodology when determining benefitted areas and costs to be allocated for recommendation to the city council. 
(1)  Sanitary sewer. 
a.  Properties that will or can be served by an extension of the system are determined. 
b.  The size (square footage) of a property in relation to the total area served is used to establish its pro-rated share. 
c.  The actual cost for the sanitary sewer installation is used. Up to three percent of such cost for engineering may be included. The gross cost of installation is divided by the total square footage of the benefitting properties; the factor is multiplied by the square footage of the benefitted properties outside the subdivision to determine a gross amount due from each property. 
d.  While the developer's sanitary sewer installation allows outside property owners to connect to the sanitary sewer in the future, the future customers will still have to extend the sewer mains additional distances to account for their needs. The value of this additional work is subtracted from the gross installation cost to develop a net eligible cost for each parcel. 
(2)  Water main. 
a.  Property that will or can be served by an extension of the water main system is determined. 
b.  The total front footage of all of the benefitted properties is determined. 
c.  The actual cost for the installation is used. Up to three percent of such costs may be included for engineering. The cost for installation is divided by the total front footage for the benefitting properties. 
d.  The factor is applied to the benefitted properties outside the subdivision. 
(3)  Storm sewer. 
a.  Property that will or can be served by an extension of the storm sewer system is determined. 
b.  The size (square footage) of a property in relation to the total area served is used to establish its pro-rated share. 
c.  The actual cost for the storm water sewer installation is used. Up to three percent of such costs may be included for engineering. 
d.  The gross cost of installation is divided by the total square footage of the benefitting properties. The factor is multiplied by the square footage of the benefitted property outside the subdivision. Only those costs that are attributable to benefitted properties outside the subdivision are included in the ordinance.

The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

Sec. 110-186. - Stormwater management fee. 
(a)  The base billing unit for the stormwater management fee is defined as the runoff generated by the "typical" single-family residence. The runoff will be measured in terms of mean or median square feet of impervious area defined as the "equivalent residential unit" (ERU). The ERU is the measure that will serve as an index to compare runoff generated by different types and uses of properties with different stormwater generation characteristics. The ERU is defined as 3,604 square feet of impervious surface area. The stormwater management fee per ERU is in accordance with the schedule of rates, fees, fines and penalties as adopted by the city council from time to time and found in appendix B to this Code. 
(b)  There is hereby established a stormwater management fee for single-family detached residences and single-family attached residences (townhomes) at the rate set in accordance with the schedule of rates, fees, fines and penalties as adopted by the city council from time to time and found in appendix B to this Code. 
(c)  Properties other than single-family detached residences and single-family attached residences (townhomes) will be charged a stormwater management fee at the rate set in appendix B for each ERU, or fraction thereof, of impervious surface area of the property. (Example: a property consisting of 50,000 square feet of which 25,000 square feet is impervious would pay a stormwater management fee computed as follows: 25,000 square feet of impervious surface divided by the ERU (3,604 square feet) equals 6.9; the 6.9 ERU multiplied by the rate set in appendix B.) 
(d)  All premises lying within the corporate limits of the City of Rolling Meadows, will pay a rate set in appendix B per ERU. The ERU is defined as 3,604 square feet of impervious surface area.

If any bill is paid after such period, there shall be added thereto a late charge of ten percent of the storm sewer management fee to be paid by any sewer user making a late payment. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1, 6-12-2001) 
Sec. 110-189. - Right to change rates and regulations. 
    The city reserves the right to make such reasonable changes in rates and in conditions established in this provision and to establish further rules and regulations from time to time as may be found expeditious or necessary. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1, 6-12-2001) 
Sec. 110-190. - Lien for unpaid charges. 
(a)  Charges for stormwater sewer service shall be upon the premises serviced. Whenever a bill for storm sewer service remains unpaid 30 days after it has become due, the director of finance may direct the city attorney to file with the recorder of deeds of the county a statement of lien claim or take other appropriate action, including but not limited to the use of a collection agency. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the city claims a lien for the amount when due plus any and all charges for the storm sewer service subsequent to the period covered by the then-due bill. 
(b)  If the storm sewer user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the director of finance has notice of this, the notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises, if his address is known, whenever such bills remain unpaid for a period of 20 days after it has become due. 
(c)  The failure of the city to record such lien claim or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid storm sewer maintenance fees. 
(d)  Property subject to a lien for unpaid storm sewer management fee charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the charges, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the stormwater management fee, after deducting costs, as the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosures shall be a bill in equity in the name of 
the city. The city attorney is authorized to institute such proceedings in the name of the city and in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which a stormwater management fee charge has remained unpaid and a statement of lien claim has been filed as set forth in this section and a period of 30 days has lapsed since such filing.

Sec. 114-26. - Statement of purpose. 
    The primary objective of the city government is to provide the citizens of Rolling Meadows a safe, prosperous, and healthy community in which to live and work. To consistently meet this objective requires the coordinated efforts of many individuals and municipal departments including those responsible for maintaining the infrastructure of the city. Components of this infrastructure include streets, sidewalks, sewers, buildings and trees. Healthy trees are unique in that they appreciate in value as they mature, unlike other components of the infrastructure that continually depreciate over time. 
    Trees provide a wide range of benefits to the city. Healthy trees reduce air and noise pollution, slow stormwater runoff, contribute to energy conservation through shade and protection from the wind, and significantly increase property values. Trees need sufficient soil, water, and air to survive. Protecting existing natural resources and planning for the establishment and care of new trees will enhance the economic and environmental health of the city. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote and protect public health and safety by providing for the proper establishment of new trees, the protection and maintenance of existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous or undesirable trees. 
(Ord. No. 00-36, § 1, 8-8-2000) 
Sec. 114-27. - Goals. 
    The provisions contained in the City Code are designed to yield specific goals when properly implemented. These goals include: 
(1)  Maintain a healthy urban forest. The urban forest of the city is a dynamic ecosystem comprised of trees, soil, water, air, wildlife and humans. Proper stewardship of the ecosystem is the most efficient and economical method of ensuring a safe and relatively hazard-free environment for the citizens of Rolling Meadows. 
(2)  Promote age and species diversity of the tree population. The long-term health of city' urban forest depends on a proper distribution of young, middle-aged and mature trees. Adequate stocking of variously aged trees ensures that as mature trees decline and are removed, younger trees are available to fill in the canopy. Species diversity is also important to guard against substantial losses to a species-specific pest or disease, such as Dutch elm disease. 
(3)  Improve species and site selection for new tree plantings. Increasing species diversity will only improve the urban forest if the species are matched with the site in which they are growing. Large trees provide the greatest benefits relative to energy conservation; air quality and storm water retention, but require sufficient space to reach their full size at maturity. Small trees can be used in a variety of places that are size restricted, however, if a space will accommodate a tree that achieves a larger size at maturity, the larger-growing species should be considered. The proper tree should be located according to the conditions of the site with consideration given to increasing canopy closure, maximizing environmental benefits and achieving consistency in the landscape design. 
(4)  Establish optimum canopy closure. Trees help to conserve energy by providing shade to buildings during the summer. Additional cooling can be realized by shading roads and parking lots that would otherwise absorb sunlight and radiate heat. Since the city is located in a climate where considerably more energy is spent on heating than cooling, consideration must also be given to the effect of shade on heating costs in the winter. Careful consideration of the establishment of new trees will result in the optimum canopy closure relative to energy conservation. 
(5)  Resolution and prevention of tree/hardscape conflicts through coordinated planning. Trees require space for roots, trunk, and branches. Frequently the space occupied by portions of trees is needed for other elements of the infrastructure such as roads, sewers, utility lines and buildings. Conflicts between trees and other infrastructure components can be minimized through cooperation of the various city departments, local utility companies and citizens. The provisions of this article are intended to facilitate communication and cooperation between those individuals and agencies charged with maintaining the city's infrastructure. 
(6)  Provide attractive and aesthetically pleasing transportation routes and open space. The city recognizes the benefits associated with the development of shade provided by trees along motor vehicle and bicycle routes in the community. The shade provides a cooling effect, which encourages physical activity, manifested by walking, jogging and bicycle riding. In addition, the beauty of a tree canopy adds charm and attractiveness to residential and commercial settings. 
(7)  Promote public education and support. The primary reason to care for trees and natural resources in the city is to improve the community for its citizens. The urban forest management program must be based on the informed support of the citizens. A goal of this article is to provide proper tree care through informed, professional management based on knowledge. Those city employees responsible for the management of natural resources in Rolling Meadows are also responsible for sharing their knowledge and sources of information with the public. 
(8)  Facilitate the resolution of tree-related conflicts. A goal of this article is to make available reasonable and fair guidelines for maintaining healthy, structurally sound and safe trees, and providing a comprehensive standards manual for planting, pruning and removing trees. By providing these guidelines in a clear and understandable format, equal and fair treatment is guaranteed for all residents.

(4)  Regulations governing tree planting. All trees to be planted on public property shall be planted in accordance with the provisions outlined in the current arboricultural standards manual on file in the offices of the department of public works. 
(Ord. No. 00-36, § 1, 8-8-2000; Ord. No. 12-16, § 1.b, 3-27-2012) 
Sec. 114-34. - Spraying or pruning of trees. 
(a)  Pesticide application and pruning of trees. It shall be unlawful to treat diseases or pests through pesticide application or application of materials, or prune or remove branches from any public tree without having first secured a permit therefor. Applications for such permits or requests for exemption shall be made to the director of public works or designee for approval before permission shall be granted. As a condition of a contractor obtaining a pesticide application or pruning permit the applicant shall be required to carry public liability and property damage insurance in an amount to be determined by the director of public works and proof of insurance coverage shall be filed with same. When advisable, the director of public works may require the posting of a performance bond to guarantee the completion of any job in accordance with adopted city standards, rules and regulations. 
(b)  certified arborist required. When performing pruning on public trees, any tree service contractor performing work shall have on its staff an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture. This arborist must oversee all pruning work and certify that all work meets the city's pruning specifications as outlined in the city arboricultural standards manual. 
(c)  Safety standards. All tree service contractors pruning, maintaining or removing city trees must comply with safety requirements as specified in the State of Illinois and Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the American National Standards Institute. 
(d)  Topping. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person or firm to top any public tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes may be exempted from this requirement as determined by the director of public works or designee. 
(e)  Pruning standards. Trees are pruned to preserve their health and appearance and to make adjustments that will increase their longevity. Pruning will reduce or eliminate hazards and can provide adequate clearance around utility lines. To achieve the objectives of extending the life of city trees, reducing hazards, and providing appropriate utility line clearance, pruning must be conducted using sound arboricultural methods. The city shall maintain pruning standards consistent with the National Arborist Association and the American National Standards Institute. 
(f)  Pruning American elm or oak trees. To help prevent the spread of Dutch elm disease and oak wilt, American elm or oak trees on public property shall not be pruned during the growing season, except when, in the opinion of the director of public works or designee, pruning is required to alleviate an imminent hazard. Other exemptions from this requirement may be granted as deemed necessary by the director of public works or designee. 
(g)  Pruning diseased trees. All tools used on a public tree known to contain an infectious tree disease shall be properly disinfected immediately after completing work in such a tree. 
(h)  Utility line clearance pruning. 
(1)  The city recognizes the need to maintain utility lines with regard to public safety and service. The city also recognizes the benefits provided by healthy public trees. In the cases where public trees occupy space under or adjacent to overhead utility lines, the need to maintain utility line clearance will be balanced with the need to maintain healthy trees by using proper arboricultural pruning techniques to obtain the required clearance. Topping is not a proper arboricultural pruning technique and shall not be used in utility line clearance of public trees in the city. 
(2)  With the exception of emergency line clearance operations, companies or organizations owning utility lines in the city, or their line clearance contractors, are required to notify the mayor of vegetation maintenance activities at least 21 calendar days before beginning the activity. Notice shall be in writing. 
(3)  When necessary, as determined by the director of public works or designee, a representative of the utility company, who shall be an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) or a degreed forester, will be required to meet with the director of public works or designee to evaluate the impact of pruning on specific public trees and to evaluate tree removals requested by the utility company. Joint agreement is required prior to all public tree removals. Criteria to be considered in tree removals include potential hazards, tree health and species, damage from past maintenance, and tree location. 
(4)  Each parkway tree that is removed for the purpose of utility line clearance shall be replaced with one newly planted tree. The species selection for replacement trees will consider the available growing space under or adjacent to utility lines and will use narrow-crowned or low-growing cultivars when appropriate. When it is not practical install a replacement tree at the site of a tree removal, the replacement tree shall be planted in another public location as identified by the director of public works or designee. The utility company will reimburse the city for the cost of purchase and installation of replacement trees, unless other arrangements have been agreed to in a franchise agreement. 
(5)  A written agreement between the city and a electric public utility that mandates or allows for specific less restrictive standards and practices for vegetation management shall take precedence over section 114-34(a) through (h)(5) of the City Code of Ordinances. 
(6)  Where line clearance pruning will be performed on private property, the utility company shall be required to provide advance written notice to each individual property owner. Such notice shall be in the form of a door hanger or a mailing to each property, and shall include a phone number where questions can be directed. Said notice shall be made at least seven calendar dates in advance. Additionally, the scope of the work to be performed on private trees shall be determined in advance of pruning by an ISA certified arborist or a degreed forester. 
(Ord. No. 00-36, § 1, 8-8-2000; Ord. No. 12-16, § 1.c, 3-27-2012) 
Sec. 114-35. - Planting trees under electrical utility lines. 
    Large-growing trees, whose canopies may grow into and disturb electrical service lines, shall not be planted directly under existing power lines or within recorded utility easements. This provision shall apply to all vegetation planted after the effective date of this article. 
(Ord. No. 00-36, § 1, 8-8-2000) 
Sec. 114-36. - Removal of trees. 
(a)  Tree removal permit. It shall be unlawful to remove or cut down any tree in any street, parkway or other city property without having first secured a permit therefor. Applications for such permits shall be made to the director of public works or designee for approval before permission shall be granted. As a condition of a contractor obtaining a tree removal permit the applicant shall be required to carry public liability and property damage insurance in an amount to be determined by the director of public works or designee and proof of insurance coverage shall be filed with same. When advisable, the director of public works may require the posting of a performance bond to guarantee the completion of any job in accordance with adopted city standards, rules and regulations. 
(b)  Issuance or denial of permit. Within ten days after receipt of a completed application for a tree removal permit, the director of public works or designee shall review the application for compliance with applicable city regulations. If the proposed removal does not so comply, the director of public works or designee shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for noncompliance. Requests for tree removals will be reviewed on an individual basis. However, general guidelines regarding acceptable and unacceptable reasons for tree removals are contained in the city arboricultural standards manual. Applicants for tree removal permits are advised to review tree removal criteria prior to submitting a tree removal permit application. 
(c)  Safety standards. All tree service contractors pruning, maintaining or removing city trees must comply with safety requirements as specified in the State of Illinois and federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and or American National Standards Institute regulations.

In exercising the powers in this section, the commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the public works director or his designee from whom the appeal is taken.

For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, if the principal building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 50 percent of its replacement value, it shall then be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities as required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or construction. 
(n)  Submission of plot plan. Any application for a building permit shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this chapter.

Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or other public way in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements. No driveway across public property or requiring a curb shall exceed a width of 25 feet. 
(5)  Location in yards. Off-street parking spaces and driveways within yard areas shall conform to the requirements of article VII of chapter 18 of this Code relating to driveways.

ARTICLE V. - SPECIAL USES 

Sec. 122-301. - Purpose. 
    The principal objective of this chapter is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses, and for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the city. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various districts established by this chapter. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to allow because of their unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These special uses require particular considerations as to their proper location in relation to adjacent, established or intended uses, or to the planned development of the community. The conditions controlling the location and operation of such special uses are established by this article. 
(Ord. No. 626, § 3 (art. VII, § 1), 12-14-1972) 
Sec. 122-302. - Authority. 
    The city council shall have authority to permit a special use of land or structures or both, subject to the hearing procedures and conditions stipulated in this article, if it finds that the proposed location and establishment of any such use will be desirable or necessary for the public convenience or welfare and will be harmonious and compatible with other uses adjacent to and in the vicinity of a selected site. 
(Ord. No. 626, § 3 (art. VII, § 2), 12-14-1972) 
Sec. 122-303. - Conditions and approval. 
    The planning and zoning commission or committee appointed by the mayor and city council may recommend and the city council may impose such restrictions upon the height and bulk and area of occupancy of any structure so approved for special use as may be reasonable under the particular circumstances, provided that such restrictions and stipulations shall not be more restrictive than the requirements established for the district in which such structure is proposed to be located or as may be required in any city ordinance. Off-street parking facilities as well as off-street loading and unloading spaces pedestrian and bicycle facilities may also be stipulated in the order permitting special uses. 
(Ord. No. 626, § 3 (art. VII, § 3), 12-14-1972; Ord. No. 02-04, § 12, 2-12-2002; Ord. No. 17-19, § 46, 6-13-2017)

No. 05-27, adopted June 28, 2005. 
Sec. 122-304. - Procedure. 
    The procedure to be followed in considering applications for special uses shall be as follows:
