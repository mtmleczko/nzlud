PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Westport, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through May 15, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Representative Town Meeting. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the town officials for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Town's affairs.

A designated Town official other than the hearing officer may present evidence on behalf of the Town. A person(s) wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence on his/her behalf. If the person(s) who received the citation fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him/her upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable provisions of the zoning regulations. The hearing officer may accept from such person(s) copies of any relevant police reports, zoning inspection reports, and/or any other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person(s) is unnecessary. 
(c)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form, and with such methods of proof, as he/she deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce his/her decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person(s) who received the citation is not liable, the hearing officer shall dismiss the matter and enter that determination in writing accordingly.

Sec. 10-44. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Animal Control Officer means any person employed or appointed by the Town who is authorized to investigate and enforce violations relating to animal control or cruelty under the provisions of this division. 
    At large means a dog is not under the direct control of the owner. 
    Dangerous dog means any dog that, because of its training or characteristic behavior, presents a risk of serious physical harm or death to human beings, or constitutes a danger to human life or property, including pets, if not kept under the direct control of the owner. The term "dangerous dog" shall not apply to dogs utilized by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties. The term "dangerous dog" includes any dog that has been subject to a determination by the Police Department and/or its Animal Control Division, any animal shelter, or any law enforcement agency that it has committed one or more of the following acts: 
(1)  Has aggressively bitten, attacked, endangered, or inflicted severe injury on a human being on public or private property, or when unprovoked, has chased or approached a person upon any public or private property other than its owner's in a menacing fashion while snarling, growling or snapping, provided that such actions are attested to in a sworn statement by one or more persons and dutifully investigated by any of the above-referenced authorities; 
(2)  Has severely injured or killed a domestic animal or pet while off its owner's property; or 
(3)  Has been used primarily or in part for the purpose of dogfighting, or is a dog trained for dogfighting. 
    Direct control means immediate, continuous physical control of a dog, such as by means of a leash, cord, secure fence, or chain of such strength to restrain the dog and controlled by a person capable of restraining the dog, or safe and secure restraint within a vehicle. If the controlling person is at all times fully and clearly within unobstructed sight and hearing of the dog, voice control shall be considered direct control when the dog is actually participating in training or in an official showing, obedience, or field event. Direct control shall not be required of dogs actually participating in a legal sport in an authorized area or to government police dogs. 
    Impoundment means the taking or picking up and confining of an animal by any Police Officer, Animal Control Officer or any other public officer under the provisions of this division. 
    Muzzle means a device constructed of strong, soft material or of metal, designed to fasten over the mouth of an animal to prevent the animal from biting any person or other animal. 
    Owner means any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity owning, harboring or keeping any animal, or in the case of a person under the age of 18 years, the person's parent or legal guardian. An animal shall be deemed to be harbored if it is fed or sheltered for three or more consecutive days. This definition shall not apply to any veterinary clinic or boarding kennel. 
    Sanitary condition means a condition of good order and cleanliness to minimize the possibility of disease transmission. 
    Under restraint means an animal is secured by a leash, led under the control of a person physically capable of restraining the animal and obedient to that person's commands, or securely enclosed within the real property limits of the owner's premises.

Sec. 10-45. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purposes of this division are to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Town. It is intended to ensure responsible handling of dangerous dogs, as in Section 10-44, by their owners through registration and confinement. 
(Code 1981, § 7-2) 
Sec. 10-46. - Procedure for declaring dog dangerous. 
(a)  Any adult person may request that a dog be classified as dangerous, as defined in Section 10-44, by submitting a written complaint to the Police Department on a form approved by the Chief of Police. Any Animal Control Officer may also initiate a complaint with the Department. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall notify the owner of the dog that a complaint has been filed and that an investigation into the allegations as set forth in the complaint will be conducted. 
(b)  At the conclusion of the investigation, the Chief of Police or his or her designee may: 
(1)  Determine that the dog is not dangerous and, if the dog is impounded, waive any impoundment fees incurred and release the dog to its owner; or 
(2)  Determine that the dog is dangerous and order the owner to comply with the requirements for keeping dangerous dogs set forth in Section 10-50, and if the dog is impounded, release the dog to its owner after the owner has paid all fees incurred for the impoundment. Impoundment fees may be waived at the discretion of the Chief of Police or his or her designee upon a showing of financial hardship. If all impoundment fees have not been paid within ten business days after a final determination that a dog is dangerous and a waiver of fees has not been granted, the Animal Control Officer shall attempt to relocate the dog to an established animal rescue organization and may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed if he or she is unable to relocate the dog to such an organization within 15 business days. Before the Animal Control Officer relocates a dog to an animal rescue organization, he or she shall receive, in writing, a statement from the organization that it has been notified of the dog's dangerousness and that the organization will hold the Town harmless from any liability arising from harm caused by the dog. 
(c)  The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall not declare a dog to be dangerous based on any of the following: 
(1)  If any injury or damage is sustained by a person who, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon premises occupied by the owner of the dog or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime; 
(2)  If any injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal or pet which, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was teasing, tormenting, assaulting the dog or was invading the premises occupied by the owner of the dog; 
(3)  If the dog was protecting or defending the premises occupied by the owner of the dog or a human being within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an attack or assault. 
(Code 1981, § 7-4) 
Sec. 10-47. - Notification of determination regarding dangerous dog declaration. 
(a)  Within five business days after declaring a dog dangerous, the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall notify the owner and the complainant(s), by certified mail, of the dog's designation as a dangerous dog and any specific restrictions and conditions for keeping the dog, as set forth in Section 10-50. The Chief of Police or his or her designee also shall notify the First Selectman of the designation of any dog as a dangerous dog. Such notification shall describe the dog and specify any particular requirements or conditions placed upon the dog owner. 
(b)  The notice shall inform the dog owner that any and all specific restrictions and conditions for keeping the dog imposed by the Chief of Police or his or her designee become effective five business days after receipt of the notice and that a failure to comply after that time constitutes a violation of Section 10-50. The notice shall also inform the dog owner that he or she may, within five business days of receipt of such notice, make a written request to the Animal Control Officer for a hearing to contest the Chief of Police or his or her designee's finding and designation. 
(c)  Within five business days after determining that a dog is not dangerous, the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall notify the dog owner and the complainant(s) by certified mail of the determination. The notice shall also state that a complainant may, within five business days of receipt of such notice, make a written request to the Animal Control Officer for a hearing to contest the Chief of Police or his or her designee's finding and determination. 
(d)  If the Animal Control Officer cannot, with due diligence, locate the owner of a dog that has been seized pursuant to this division, he or she shall cause the dog to be impounded for not less than 15 business days. If, after 15 business days, the owner fails to claim the dog, the Animal Control Officer shall attempt to relocate the dog to an established animal rescue organization and may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed if he or she is unable to relocate the dog to such an organization within 15 business days. Before the Animal Control Officer relocates a dog to an animal rescue organization, he or she shall receive, in writing, a statement from the organization that it has been notified of the dog's dangerousness and that the organization will hold the Town harmless from any liability arising from harm caused by the dog. 
(Code 1981, § 7-5) 
Sec. 10-48. - Dangerous Dog Hearing Board; hearing, procedures. 
(a)  Composition. There shall be a Dangerous Dog Hearing Board consisting of five members who shall be appointed by the First Selectman.

Each member of this Board shall serve for a term of two years. The Board shall hold a hearing within ten business days after receiving written request for such a hearing. The Board shall provide notice of the date, time and location of the hearing by certified mail to the dog owner and the complainant(s).

(3)  Previous aggressive history of the dog; 
(4)  Observable behavior of the dog; 
(5)  Site and circumstances of the incident; and 
(6)  Statements from interested parties. 
(c)  Factors. The Board shall not declare a dog to be dangerous based on any of the following:

(2)  If any injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal or pet which, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was teasing, tormenting, assaulting the dog or was invading the premises occupied by the owner of the dog; 
(3)  If the dog was protecting or defending the premises occupied by the owner of the dog or a human being within immediate vicinity of the dog from an attack or assault. 
(d)  Determination as dangerous. A determination by the Dangerous Dog Hearing Board at a hearing that the dog is in fact a dangerous dog as defined in the definition of the term "dangerous dog" in Section 10-44 shall subject the dog and its owner to the provisions of this division. 
(e)  Failure to request hearing. Failure of the dog owner to request a hearing within five business days to contest a dangerous dog determination by the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall result in the dog being finally declared a dangerous dog and shall subject the dog and its owner to the provisions of this division. 
(Code 1981, § 7-6) 
Sec. 10-49. - Appeal from determination of Hearing Board. 
(a)  If the Dangerous Dog Hearing Board determines that a dog is dangerous at the conclusion of a hearing conducted under Section 10-48, that decision shall be final.

(6)  Notification of escape. The owner of a dangerous dog shall notify the Police Department immediately if such dog escapes from its enclosure or restraint and is at large. Such immediate notification shall also be required if the dog bites or attacks a person, pet, or domestic animal. 
(7)  Failure to comply. It shall be unlawful for any owner of a dangerous dog registered with the Police Department to fail to comply with the requirements and conditions set forth in this section. Any dog found to be in violation of this section shall be subject to seizure and impoundment. In the event that the owner or custodian of the dog refuses to surrender the dog, the Animal Control Officer may request a Police Officer to obtain a search warrant and to seize the dog upon the execution of the warrant.

A designated Town official other than the hearing officer may present evidence on behalf of the Town. An owner/occupant wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence on his behalf. If the owner/occupant who received the citation fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes and this article. The hearing officer may accept from such owner/occupant copies of any relevant investigatory and citation reports, and/or any other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is unnecessary.

The Clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of the hearing officer's record of assessment as well as court costs, against such person(s) in favor of the Town. The hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution of such judgment may issue without further notice to the owner/occupant. 
(e)  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this article is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal in accordance with C.G.S. § 7-152c(g).

The receipt of such a petition for review shall prohibit any applicant from commencing the proposed activity until receipt of the RTM decision. The right to review of the RTM must be exercised within 90 days after receipt of the petition for review. The Town Clerk shall give written notice of the decision of the RTM by certified mail to the applicant within 15 days of the RTM action.

Sec. 54-69. - Tax relief programs. 
    An applicant may apply for one or more of the following tax relief programs: 
(1)  Tax abatement. For applicants who elect to apply for the tax abatement benefits under this division, the benefit shall be allowed on a graduated basis, as follows: 
Total Qualifying Income Benefit Rate Less than $25,000.00 $4,200.00 shall be abated $25,000.00, but less than $35,000.00 $3,600.00 shall be abated $35,000.00, but less than $45,000.00 $2,400.00 shall be abated $45,000.00, but less than $65,000.00 $1,200.00 shall be abated  
For the tax year commencing July 1, 2017 and for each tax year thereafter, the amount of tax abatement benefits shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the New York, Northern New Jersey and Long Island (NY-NJ-CT-PA) Region (1982-1984 = 100) reported as of September of each tax year. The adjustment shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula and rounded to the nearest dollar. 
The abatement benefit for the current tax year will be multiplied by the CPI-W in effect as of the immediately preceding tax year. The result will be divided by the CPI-W in effect as of two tax years prior to the current tax year. 
For example: 
Current tax year abatement benefit (2017) = $1,200.00 
CPI-W (2016) = 262.50 (estimated)

(Code 1981, § 147-11) 
Sec. 62-41. - Petition for extension of water main. 
    Upon the petition of 60 percent of the property owners of an affected area, the Board of Selectmen shall consider a designated area for an extension of a water main. 
(Code 1981, § 147-12) 
Sec. 62-42. - Limit on indebtedness for water main extensions.

Sec. 62-43. - Procedure for imposing assessments. 
(a)  Before the Board of Selectmen shall submit an appropriation for the cost of an extension of any water main as permitted by C.G.S. § 7-137c, it shall hold a public hearing with regard to such proposed extension, at which time any resident of the Town may be heard with regard thereto. Notice of such hearing, which notice shall identify the approximate area of the proposed extension, shall be published in a newspaper having a circulation in the Town not later than seven days prior to the hearing. At such hearing, the Board of Selectmen shall have available: 
(1)  Such cost estimates as it may then have with regard to the proposed cost of the extension; 
(2)  Recommendations from the Town Engineer; and 
(3)  An opinion, if available, from the Director of the Health District regarding the proposed water main extension, which opinion shall consider the health and safety of the residents of the affected area due to either the quality or quantity of the existing water supply. 
(b)  Within 60 days after the conclusion of the public hearing, the Board of Selectmen shall determine whether it intends to proceed with the extension, and if it intends to proceed with the extension, it shall submit an appropriation for such funds in such manner as is permitted by the Town Charter. Such appropriation shall either be submitted for the upcoming budget or as a supplemental appropriation to the budget under which the Town is then operating. In making a determination on the proposed water main extension, the Board of Selectmen shall consider the items in Subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section as well as the extent, desire and need of the residents to be connected to the public water supply, their willingness to bear the total costs as set forth herein, and any other relevant factors. 
(c)  Whenever the Town shall, pursuant to the provisions of the Charter, appropriate funds for the extension of water mains as permitted by C.G.S. § 7-137c, the owner of each property abutting such main shall reimburse the Town for his or her proportionate share of the total cost of the extension, according to this section. 
(Code 1981, § 147-14) 
Sec. 62-44. - Determination of cost and share of assessment. 
(a)  The total cost of any extension shall be calculated and determined by the Town Engineer within one year after the extension has been completed. The total cost shall include, but shall not be limited to, the cost of water mains, including materials, installation, pumping stations, hydrants, service connections, curb, sidewalk and highway repairs; the cost of the installation of gate valves and shutoffs; the cost of land acquisition, if any; all administrative costs, including all administrative costs associated with any assessment and the collection thereof; and any other incidental expenses in connection with the foregoing. 
(b)  The proposed share of each property owner shall be determined in such a way that the Town shall be ultimately free from any costs of the extension and expenses incidental thereto, except where any portion of the water main or service is to be used for a municipal purpose, the Town shall contribute a fair proportion of the expense representing such proportional municipal share. 
(c)  In a residence zone, the proportionate share of each property owner abutting the main shall be determined by dividing the total cost of the extension by the number of residential lots capable of being served by the water main and abutting the water main. The sum thus derived shall be the proportionate share. 
(d)  The proportionate share shall be the proposed assessment for each property owner. The Town Engineer shall prepare a list of the proposed assessments, which list shall identify the property to be affected by the proposed assessment, and shall contain the names and addresses of the owners thereof as on file with the Assessor's office as of the date that the list is prepared. The list shall be filed with the Town Clerk. The Board of Selectmen shall establish a date for a public hearing, which shall not be later than 60 days following the determination of the proposed assessment, and shall cause a notice of public hearing to be published in the newspaper having a circulation in the Town at least once and not less than seven days prior to the hearing date. A notice of the proposed assessment shall be mailed to each landowner of record abutting the water main and such notice shall indicate the date, place and time of the public hearing and advise that any person desiring may appear and be heard. The notice shall be mailed to the address on file with the Assessor as of the date of mailing and shall be mailed by United States mail, postage prepaid, not later than 14 days prior to the hearing. 
(e)  At the hearing, the Board of Selectmen shall cause to be placed on the record the basis of the cost calculation that has been made and the method selected in determining the fair share of each property owner. 
(f)  Within 30 days after the hearing, the Board of Selectmen shall make such assessments as it finds to equal the fair proportionate share of each property owner in accordance with C.G.S. § 7-137c, and shall cause a notice of the assessment containing the names and addresses of the property owners and the amount of the assessment and identifying the property in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the Town. 
(Code 1981, § 147-15) 
Sec. 62-45. - Payment. 
    Any property owner whose proportionate share of the cost of the water main extension has been reduced to an assessment laid upon their property may elect to pay such assessment in total at the time the assessment is laid or may pay such assessment in equal annual installments over a period not to exceed 20 years from the due date of the special assessment or such other period as may be required by statute. The property owner shall pay interest on the outstanding principal balance at a rate which shall not be less than the interest rate being paid by the Town on any obligation incurred to finance the project. The principal amount of such assessment, together with accrued interest, shall constitute a lien on the property which shall be recorded in the land records of the Town. 
(Code 1981, § 147-16) 
Sec. 62-46. - Deferral. 
    In the case of any land zoned residential or classified pursuant to C.G.S. §§ 12-107a to 12-107e, inclusive, as farm land, forest land or open space land on the last completed grand list of the Town, which exceeds by more than 100 percent the size of the smallest lot permitted in the lowest density residential zone allowed under the zoning regulations, assessment of such excess land shall be deferred until such time as such excess land shall be built upon or a building permit issued therefore, or until approval of a subdivision plan of such excess property by the Planning and Zoning Commission, whichever event occurs first, at which time the assessment shall be made. In the event that such assessment is deferred, a caveat shall be placed on the land records. 
(Code 1981, § 147-17) 
Sec. 62-47. - Determination of assessment in industrial and commercial zones. 
    In an industrial and commercial zone, the proportionate share of each property owner abutting the main shall be determined in each case, on a case-by-case basis, on a front-foot or other equitable basis, provided that if residential or agricultural property or property zoned for residential or agricultural use abuts lines of construction of water mains to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, or partly for commercial purposes, or partly for commercial or industrial purposes, and such property is not being used for such purposes, the proportionate share of the owners of such property shall be computed on a front-foot or other equitable basis for a standard or minimum size main. 
(Code 1981, § 147-18) 
Sec. 62-48. - Grant received for water main extension. 
    In any case where the need for a particular extension is in response to a community pollution problem as defined by C.G.S. § 22a-423, and a grant is received from the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, the Town may waive such reimbursement to the extent of any grant actually received. 
(Code 1981, § 147-19) 
Sec. 62-49. - Installation of water mains. 
(a)  All water mains shall be installed in existing streets or rights-of-way whenever possible. 
(b)  All mains shall have a tap brought to the edge of the right-of-way of the Town abutting the land of all adjoining property owners so as to avoid disruption of the surface of the highway when and if a particular property owner determines to make use of the water service. 
(Code 1981, § 147-20) 
Sec. 62-50. - Appeals. 
    Within 60 days of an assessment made pursuant to this division and C.G.S. § 7-137c, the owner of any property assessed may appeal to the superior court pursuant to the provisions of C.G.S. § 7-137c.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Res. of 11-12-2013 amended Art. VI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, § A162-20, pertained to conflict of interest. Res. of 11-12-2013 set out provisions intended for use as §§ A162-20-A162-23. To avoid duplication of section numbers, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ A162-20-A162-20.3. 

Sec. A162-20. - Purpose of the RTM Code of Ethics. 
    It is a guiding principle of the RTM that its members be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people of the Town of Westport. To ensure that the public retains full confidence in the integrity of the RTM the following Code of Ethics is hereby adopted. 
( Res. of 11-12-2013 ) 
Sec. A162-20.1. - General standard; responsibility of the RTM members; conflicts of interest; misuse of RTM position or resources. 
A.  Responsibility of RTM members. It shall be the responsibility of all RTM Members to carry out their official duties to the best of their abilities and with the highest moral and ethical standards. Members shall conduct themselves in a manner to be above reproach and be in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and codes, including the Town Charter, Town Ordinances and the Rules of Procedure of the RTM. 
B.  Conflicts of interest for RTM members. All members should be most sensitive to permitting an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest to exist, even though a complete disclosure of all circumstances would show that an actual conflict did not exist in a particular case. The individual member shall decide in any given situation whether he or she is faced with such conflict. Such decision shall not preclude the Representative Town Meeting from determining that a conflict of interest does, in fact, exist; but the determination of the Representative Town Meeting shall not prevent the member from voting or participating. 
C.  Misuse of RTM position or resources. RTM Members shall not use the power or authority of their position in any manner intended to induce or coerce any person or entity to provide, directly or indirectly, anything of value which shall accrue to the private advantage, benefit, or economic gain, of the RTM Member. As used in this section, the term "private advantage, benefit, or economic gain" means any advantage, benefits or economic gain, distinct from that enjoyed by members of the public without regard to official status or not resulting naturally from lawful and proper performance of duties. 
( Res. of 11-12-2013 ) 
Sec. A162-20.2. - Ethics concerns. 
    Potential ethics concerns should be discussed with the RTM Moderator or the RTM Deputy Moderator for resolution as appropriate. 
( Res. of 11-12-2013 ) 
Sec. A162-20.3. - Ethics Code and conflicts of interest acknowledgements. 
    RTM Members, at the start of each term, shall sign and submit to the Town Clerk an acknowledgement form stating that they have read and agree to uphold the "RTM Code of Ethics" and relevant guidelines as adopted by the RTM. RTM members, at the start of each term, shall sign and submit to the Town Clerk the Town Disclosure Form related to "Conflicts of Interest." 
( Res. of 11-12-2013 ) 
ARTICLE VII. - ORDINANCES 

Sec. A162-21. - Stand over of ordinances. 
A.  All proposed ordinances and all amendments, other than minor language changes to existing ordinances, shall automatically stand over for one meeting and shall be referred by the Moderator to a regular or special committee(s) for consideration. 
B.  Each committee to which the ordinances or amendments are referred shall prepare a written report and deliver same, when completed, to the Town Clerk. Appended to said report shall be a copy of the proposed ordinances or the proposed amendments to an existing ordinance, setting forth the language of the existing ordinance, the proposed new language of the amendment and the language being deleted from the existing ordinance. Deletions shall be indicated by strikethrough and new language shall be indicated by underscoring. The Town Clerk shall distribute the report and the ordinance in the form set forth herein to Representative Town Meeting members prior to the meeting at which the action on such proposed ordinance or amendment has been scheduled. 
ARTICLE VIII. - AMENDMENTS 

Sec. A162-22. - Amendments to rules of procedure; restrictions. 
    The rules governing the conduct and organization of this body may be amended at any meeting by a majority of the total number of Representative Town Meeting members; provided, however, that no amendment shall be acted upon which shall not have laid over for at least one meeting or which shall not have been specified in the call as part of the business to be transacted at such meeting. 
ARTICLE IX. - LEGISLATIVE SESSION 

Sec. A162-23. - Length of session. 
    The Representative Town Meeting shall be deemed to have two-year legislative sessions.

ARTICLE X. - VOTING WHILE PRESIDING 

Sec. A162-24. - Voting by presiding officers and committee chairs. 
    In recognition of each Representative Town Meeting member's duty to represent the electors of his or her district, the presiding officers and committee chairs shall not forfeit their right to vote while presiding over Representative Town Meetings or RTM committee meetings, notwithstanding any rules of order to the contrary. During a roll call vote, the presiding officer shall vote last. 
ARTICLE XI. - REVIEW OF ZONING ACTIONS 

Sec. A162-25. - Standard of review. 
    The RTM review of a Planning and Zoning Action pursuant to Section C10-4 of the Town Charter shall not be strictly limited to a review of the Planning & Zoning Commission ("P&Z") record. Rather, the RTM shall be permitted to receive additional comments and materials outside of the original record. 
    The RTM review, in its legislative capacity, will be guided by land use criteria. These criteria include, but are not limited to, the Town of Westport's Plan of Conservation and Development and general health, safety and welfare considerations. 
    RTM members participating in the review of a P & Z action should become familiar with the P & Z record prior to the RTM meeting.

18-1 Purpose
The purpose of the Residence C Zone is to permit single-family, two-family and multi-family
residences on a minimum 5,000 square feet lot with a minimum 50 ft. of frontage on a public
street. The Residence C provisions are intended to allow moderate/high density development
(greater than the Residence B Zone density) for smaller sized dwelling units on small parcels
along Saugatuck and Riverside Avenues and served by public sanitary sewerage facilities. The
Residence C Zone shall also allow for the redevelopment and/or adaptive reuse of existing nonresidential
buildings on Riverside Avenue into larger sized dwelling units on lots over two (2)
acres in non-residentially zoned lots and residentially zoned lots that currently have a permitted
nonresidential use with a minimum 200 feet of frontage on Riverside Avenue and served by
public sanitary sewerage facilities. It is in the public interest to preserve the existing residential
and historic scale, massing and character of the area, to provide a desirable alternative to
presently permitted commercial uses in this area, to reduce the potential traffic on public streets,
and to provide a broader choice of housing types in Westport. The Residence C district can help
to achieve these objectives.

affordability plan prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit. The plan shall include a means of
offering a "right of first refusal" to the Town of Westport for any units that are vacated once the
affordability period has ended. No development created pursuant to Section 18 of these
Regulations shall qualify as an affordable housing development pursuant to C.G.S. §8-30g
unless the development complies with all of the requirements set forth in C.G.S. §8-30g. Any
C.G.S. §8-30g application in the Residential C District may not elect to pay a fee in lieu of
providing on-site affordable units.
18-17.2
An applicant may elect, or the Commission may require the applicant, to pay a fee-in-Lieu of
constructing some of the required workforce housing units on-site, provided:
i. that seventeen and one half percent (17½%) of the number of market rate units are provided
with a minimum of five percent (5%) of the workforce or affordable units remaining onsite;
and
ii. that the balance of the 17½% not provided on-site shall be used to determine the amount of
the fee-in-lieu; and
iii. That the Planning and Zoning Commission makes a finding that the funds are appropriately
linked to the establishment of an equivalent number of offsite affordable units pursuant to
C.G.S. §8-30g.
Town of Westport, CT
Fractional units are rounded up. Units provided onsite shall be deducted in full from the total
required units to determine a fee-in-lieu, however, the number of offsite units to be created shall
be rounded up. Such fee shall take the form of a onetime cash contribution to a housing trust
fund, to be administered by the Town of Westport, to be used for constructing, rehabilitating, or
repairing housing in Westport that is affordable to persons and families of low and moderate
income who meet the income limits in C.G.S. §8-30g. Said funds shall be paid prior to the
issuance of the Zoning Permit. The cash contribution to be provided shall be calculated based
on 225% of the most recently published Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) Median
Family Income for a Family of Four encompassing Westport, as published by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Any C.G.S. §8-30g application in the
Residential C District may not elect to pay a fee in lieu of providing on-site affordable units.
Example:
a. Onsite:
15% requirement for 37 market rate (5.55) units (6 workforce or affordable units
required)
Total Units = 43 onsite
b. Offsite (Fee-in-Lieu):
17½% requirement for 37 (6.475) units (7 workforce or affordable units required)
Total Units = 44 with 5 Offsite Units
5% = 1.85 (minimum of 2 on site)
SMSA income family of 4 = $111,000 x 225% = $249,750 fee per unit
7 required  2 workforce on site = 5 affordable units for fee
5 x $249,750 = $1,248,750
Fee must yield a minimum of 5 offsite C.G.S. §8-30g compliant units.

21-1 Purpose
The purpose of the RPOD is to allow for the limited use of land as professional offices and
related activities. These provisions are designed to create a zone classification which would
afford a reasonable and desirable transition between established commercial and residential
areas. Large homes in older residential areas in the proximity of commercial areas tend to
become economically depressed as the demand for other types and locations of single-family
homes increases. The character of such areas is more residential than commercial, and from
other standpoints, this situation cannot lead to the wholesale conversion of these areas to
commercial zones. Consequently, a transitional type of zone is required to conserve the value of
such property while preserving the character of such areas and the existing buildings therein
from the standpoint of intensity of use and physical appearance. The Restricted Professional
Office District provides for such a transition.
21-2 Permitted Uses
In a Restricted Professional Office District, no land, building, or structure shall be used and no
building shall be hereafter erected, altered, or added to, unless otherwise provided in these
regulations, except for one (1) or more of the following uses:

21-2.2 Special Permit Uses
The following uses are permitted only in a principal building existing on the premises at the time
the RPOD boundary is established and subject to Special Permit and Site Plan approval in
accordance with §43, herein. This provision shall not be deemed to prevent new construction
and use of a principal building on a lot vacant at the time that each RPOD boundary is
established, provided that such new construction or reconstruction shall strictly adhere to the
purposes of this district.
21-2.2.1
Inclusionary two-family and multi-family dwelling units, subject to the provisions of §32-12,
herein.

on the premises, including, but not limited to: doctors, dentists, other medical professionals,
healthcare professionals, lawyers, real estate agents, insurance agents, mortgage brokers,
engineers, architects, designers, writers and artists.
21-2.2.3
Commercial Wireless telecommunication service facilities, in conformance with §32-16.
21-2.3 Accessory Uses
21-2.3.1
Uses customarily accessory to a permitted principal use, subject to the provisions of §32-7,
herein.
21-2.3.2
One attached dwelling unit provided the density does not exceed 20 bedrooms per acre.
21-2.3.3
Outdoor storage and display is permitted in accordance with §32-6, herein.
21-3 Lot Area (See Definitions)
The minimum lot area shall be the minimum required lot area of the Zoning District in existence
at the time such RPOD is established for the area. The lot shall have at least 50 feet of frontage
on at least one street.
21-4 Setbacks (See §31-4 through §31-8, also.)
No principal building, structure or use shall extend closer than thirty (30) feet from any front lot
line or Residential District Boundary Line, fifteen (15) feet from any side lot line or twenty-five
(25) feet from any rear lot line. No accessory building or structure shall extend closer than thirty

requirement to be set back thirty (30) feet from the front lot line are considered conforming for
the purposes of maintenance or minor repairs (as defined in §5-2 Specific Terms) to existing
façade elements. No Site Plan review is required.
21-4.2 Building Spacing

except for two-family or multi-family dwellings. No buildings or structures in any Single or
Multiple Use Development, which contains two-family or multi-family dwellings, shall exceed an
FAR as described in §32-12. In any Multiple Use Development containing two-family or multifamily
dwellings, any incremental increase in floor area above the maximum allowable FAR for
the non-residential uses shall be used for dwelling(s) units, only. No dwelling unit approved
under these bonus provisions shall thereafter be changed to any non-residential use. Floor area
used for parking and loading shall be excluded from the FAR.

Design Standards.
21-9A.2 New Construction or Substantial Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of
Existing Facades within Public View
Town of Westport, CT
Site Plan Review under §36 Village District Overlay is required for new construction or for

22-1 Purpose
The purpose of the RORD is to allow for the limited use of land and existing buildings for offices,
retail stores, multiple-family dwellings and combinations thereof. These provisions are designed
to create zone classifications, which would afford a reasonable and desirable combination of
compatible uses along the Post Road, Riverside Avenue and Saugatuck Avenue adjacent to
and in scale with established residential areas. Frame residential structures on small lots with
topographic limitations in the proximity of commercial areas tend to become economically
depressed as the demand for fire resistant buildings on larger and more accessible sites
increases. The character of such areas is more residential in architectural design, building scale
and physical features of the land. These provisions are intended to retain the residential
character of the existing buildings and are not intended to lead to the wholesale redevelopment
of those areas to new commercial uses. Consequently, a mixed-use type of zone is required to
conserve the value of such property and to recognize the intensity of uses while preserving the
character of such areas from the standpoint of compatible land uses, architectural design,
building scale and physical appearance.
22-2 Permitted Uses

fireplaces and patios or balconies.
v. Such units shall be in addition to any other below market rate requirements and shall not
serve to displace existing deed restricted affordable housing units.
vi. The Commission shall condition the issuance of a Zoning Certificate of Compliance for
the development project upon the completion of the off-site affordable units and establish
temporary deed restrictions to insure that the off-site affordable units will be built in a
timely manner.
The Commission shall judge whether an off-site unit is comparable with on-site market
rate units based upon all unit characteristics in aggregate and taking into account
offsetting attributes.
d. The Affordability Plan required to be submitted under this section shall provide for
enforceable deed covenants by which the off-site affordable units are guaranteed to have
ongoing repairs and maintenance and replacement of capital improvements comparable to
the on-site market rate units for the term of the deed restricted affordability requirement.

28-1 Purpose
These provisions are intended to retain the residential character of the existing buildings and
are not intended to lead to the wholesale redevelopment of these areas to intensify the
commercial use and to eliminate existing architectural scale and features. These BPD
provisions are designed to create a zoning classification which would afford a reasonable and
desirable linear, visual transition between established commercial areas. Frame residential
structures in commercial areas along arterial streets tend to be replaced by larger more modern
structures. The historical character of such areas is more residential in architectural design and
building scale than more recently developed areas in the General Business District.
Consequently, a limited business type zone is required to conserve the value of property while
preserving the character of such areas and existing buildings therein from the standpoint of
compatible land uses, architectural design, building scale and physical appearance. The BPD
provides for such preservation and development.
28-2 Permitted Uses

surrounding properties resulting there from:
32-8.2.1 Excessive Excavation or Fill
a. In any Residential Zoning District, the maximum amount of excavation or fill permitted on
any lot of 10,000 square feet or more in area shall not exceed an amount greater than that
required to raise or lower said parcel ten (10) feet above or below the existing natural grades
over an area equal to 50% of the allowable Total Coverage in the respective zone.
b. In any Non Residential Zoning District, the maximum amount of excavation or fill material
permitted on any lot of 10,000 square feet or more in area shall not exceed an amount
greater than that required to raise or lower said parcel ten (10) feet above or below the
existing natural grades over an area equal to 50% of the allowable Building Coverage in the
respective zone.
c. For lots with fewer than 10,000 square feet in a Residential or Non Residential Zone, the
maximum amount of excavation or fill shall not exceed 500 cubic yards and shall not exceed
ten (10) feet above or below the existing natural grade in any location.
32-8.2.2 Formula
Town of Westport, CT

amount: Lot Area (square feet) X 50% of Total Coverage percentage in Residential Zoning
District or 50% of Building Coverage percentage in Non Residential Zoning District X ten (10)
feet divided by 27 cubic feet/1 cubic yard = maximum allowable excavation or fill in cubic yards.
32-8.2.3 Maximum Fill or Excavation Quantity
No portion of any lot shall be filled or excavated to a height or depth greater than ten (10) feet
above or below the existing natural grade. On any lot the total allowable quantity of fill permitted

septic system, both primary and reserve areas, the total area to be filled for septic purposes
shall not be raised more than 4.0 feet above the existing natural grades at the time of
application for either a Zoning Permit, Site Plan, Special Permit or Subdivision Application;
except that the total amount of fill shall not exceed 1,185 cubic yards, based on an area of 100
feet X 80 feet = 8,000 square feet X 4 feet = 32,000 divided by 27 = 1,185 cubic yards.
32-8.2.5 Maximum Fill Height for Septic Systems
When fill is required for a septic system, no portion of any lot shall be filled to a height greater
than four (4) feet above the existing natural grade. The amount of fill permitted for a septic
system shall be allowed exclusive of any fill allowed under §32-8.2, above.
32-8.2.6 Total Maximum Excavation or Fill
The combined total maximum allowable quantity of excavation and fill on any lot shall not
exceed the sum of the maximum quantities of excavation and fill allowed under §32-8.2 and 32-
8.2.5, above. This shall be based upon the total excavation and fill, not the net change.
32-8.2.7 Natural Existing Grades
The natural existing grades shall be either the contour of elevations based upon an up to date
topography survey verified in the field with even numbered two (2) foot contour as a minimum,
as may be amended from time to time, or the contour elevations and/or spot elevations as
shown on an existing conditions survey map prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor. Said
contours or spot elevations shall be based on North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988
datum.

Encourage the joint use of any new antenna or wireless telecommunication tower;
32-16.1.5
Preserve the character, appearance and property values within the Town of Westport while
allowing adequate commercial wireless telecommunication service facilities to be developed;
32-16.1.6
Protect the scenic, historic, environmental and natural resources of the community; and
32-16.1.7
Lessen potential adverse effects of commercial wireless telecommunication service facilities by
minimizing the total number and height of such facilities, maximizing the use of existing
structures in commercial districts for such facilities and by requiring providers to share locations
where feasible.

feet in each direction for egress at all driveways, as measured from a point ten (10) feet back
from the traveled portion of the road (edge of pavement) to the center line of the street. Clear
unobstructed visibility shall also be provided for a minimum distance of one hundred fifty (150)
feet for the left turn ingress as measured in a straight line along the centerline of the roadway.
Said sight lines may be increased by the Town Engineer based on street alignment, gradients,
traffic volumes and speed limits. For driveways located on a site that is the subject of a Site
Plan review pursuant to §44 and also subject to a Traffic Impact Analysis pursuant to §44-2.5,
the minimum sight distance shall be based upon the design procedures set forth in the
Connecticut Department of Transportation, Highway Design Manual, Section 11-2, (as
amended). The Design Speed for calculation of sight distance shall be the 85th percentile speed
at each site driveway, as defined in section 6-2.01(7) of the Highway Design Manual, and as
determined by field measurements. Also, for sites where a Traffic Impact Analysis is required
the sight distance shall be measured at a point fifteen (15) feet back from the traveled portion of
the road (edge of pavement) to the center line of the street. However, the Commission may
reduce the point of sight distance measurements to ten (10) feet if there is a potential loss of
street trees.

between 20 and 39 parking spaces should and sites containing 40 or more parking spaces shall
provide a complete internal loop access drive or parking aisle within the lot in order to minimize
turning conflicts within the site and on the street.
Town of Westport, CT
34-11.4.1
The interconnection of adjoining parking lots shall be encouraged where said connections would
result in improved circulation, increased parking spaces, decreased curb cuts and/or signalized
access. Parking spaces lost or abandoned to a cut-through may be exempted from the
minimum parking requirements by the Commission.
34-11.5 Grades
The maximum grade for an access drive or driveway to a parking area shall not exceed 3% from
its intersection with the travelled portion of the road edge of pavement to the street line. The
grade of the access drive or driveway from the street line into the property shall not exceed six
(6) percent for the first forty (40) feet nor ten (10) percent at any point thereafter. The maximum
grade for driveway aisles and stalls (parking field) for parking shall not exceed six (6) percent.
The minimum grade shall be as required for surface drainage. Any access drive with grades of
six (6) percent or more shall be paved. Storm drainage facilities, as required by the Town
Engineer, shall be installed on any access drive or parking area with long, sustained or steep
grades in excess of four (4) percent which may cause surface water to drain onto adjacent
streets or lots.

spaces for a specific use is less than the minimum required number of parking spaces for said
use, the Commission may reserve up to fifty percent (50%) of the required spaces for future
parking needs. Cumulative applications for Reserved Future parking up to 20% of the
requirements require Site plan approval. Cumulative applications for Reserved Future Parking
which seek relief of greater than 20% up to the maximum of 50% shall require Site Plan and
Special Permit approval. Such reserved spaces shall be standard sized, small-car sized up to
twenty percent (20%) as described in §34-9, or a loading space as defined in §5-2 and shown in
the site plan and labeled "Future Parking", but landscaped for the present. The Commission
may require the future construction of said reserved spaces, or portion thereof, within three (3)
months of written notice to do so based on a change in parking demand, a change of use or a
change in traffic safety circumstances.
34-11.13 Lighting Standards for Parking Lots

36-2 Design Principles and Standards
36-3 Design Review Process
36-1 Establishment of the Village District
36-1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Village District Overlay (VDO) is to protect the distinctive character,
landscape, and historic structures and development pattern within this Village District while
encouraging a mixed use, walkable district that is attractive to residents, employees, and
visitors. New construction or substantial rehabilitation in the Village District should be
compatible with the existing character of the district and reinforce both the existing development
patterns and connections to the Saugatuck River.
36-1.2 Authorization
The Village District Overlay (VDO) Zone is hereby designated as a Village District, as
authorized by Chapter 124 (§8-2j) of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) and any new
construction or substantial reconstruction and rehabilitation of the exterior of a building shall be
reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this §36 of these Regulations and with the
requirements of CGS §8-2j.
36-1.3 Applicability
All zoning regulations, including those applying to the underlying district, shall continue to
govern the Village District, except as amended by this §36. Site plan approval by the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall be required for the following activities within the Village District
and in view from public streets, public spaces, walkways, bikeways or from the Saugatuck
River:
? New construction as defined in §5-2;
? Substantial reconstruction and rehabilitation of properties;
? Alterations to existing building façades such that the appearance of the building is changed.
The Planning and Zoning Commissions authority shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
i. The design and placement of buildings;
ii. The maintenance of public views;
iii. The design, paving materials, and placement of public roadways;

and protect the character of the Village District.
Town of Westport, CT
The Planning and Zoning Commission will review the application for Site Plan Review using the
criteria within this §36, including §36-2, Design Principles and Standards, as the basis of its
review.
A site rezoned by the Planning and Zoning Commission to Village District Overlay shall continue
to bear its original district designation, but with the initials VDO appended to indicate a Village
District Overlay designation. Designation as a Village District Overlay or the removal of such
designation shall be considered a change of zone.
36-1.4 Additions to the Village District
The Planning and Zoning Commission may add one or more parcels to an existing Village
District using the following criteria:
? The parcel to be added must be contiguous with the existing Village District boundary and
within the boundary of Westport Center as depicted in the Westport Plan of Conservation
and Development;
? The characteristics of the existing building and site must be consistent with §36-2.1 Design
Principles;
? The dimensional characteristics of the existing building and site must be consistent with
other buildings in the Village District with respect to height, setback from front lot line, and
building massing.
Town of Westport, CT
36-1.5 Advisory Opinion
The Joint Committee of the Architectural Review Board and the Historic District Commission
(the Joint Committee) is designated as the Village District Consultant for the purposes of CGS
§8-2j(f). The membership of the Joint Committee shall include at least one member who is an
architect, landscape architect, or planner who is a member of the American Institute of Certified
Planners.
The Joint Committee shall review all applications for new construction and substantial
reconstruction within the district and in view from public streets, public spaces, walkways,
bikeways and the Saugatuck River. The basis for review and recommendations shall be the

The Planning and Zoning Commission shall record the reason for approval or denial of the Site
Plan Review application.
The approval must be certified by the Planning and Zoning Commission and recorded in the
land records of the Town of Westport at the expense of the record owner. The approval must
contain the following information:
? Owner of record;
? Description of the premises to which it relates;
? Reasons for the decision.
36-2 Design Principles and Standards
Application of the Design Principles and Design Standards will reinforce the existing patterns of
land use and development with the Village District. As noted in §36-3 Design Review, The
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Joint Committee will use the Design Standards as the
basis for their review of the application. Should the Applicant apply for a Compliance Alternative
(as defined in §5-2: Specific Terms Definitions of the Zoning Regulations), the Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Joint Committee will refer to these governing Design Principles.
36-2.1 Design Principles
The following Design Principles shall apply to new construction and substantial reconstruction
and rehabilitation of properties within the Village District. These Design Principles are consistent
with the legislative requirements of CGS § 8-2j.
36-2.1.1
Town of Westport, CT
Proposed buildings or modifications to existing buildings shall be harmoniously related to their
surroundings, and the terrain in the district and to the use, scale and architecture of existing
buildings in the district that have a functional or visual relationship to a proposed building or
modification.
36-2.1.2
All spaces, structures and related site improvements visible from public roadways, public
spaces, walkways, bikeways and the Saugatuck River shall be designed to be compatible with
the elements of the area of the Village District in and around the proposed building or
modification.
36-2.1.3
The color, size, height, location, proportion of openings, roof treatments, building materials and
landscaping of commercial or residential property and any proposed signs and lighting be
evaluated for compatibility with the local architectural motif and the maintenance of views,
historic buildings, monuments and landscaping.
36-2.1.4
The removal or disruption of historic traditional or significant structures or architectural elements
shall be minimized.
36-2.1.5
The building and layout of buildings and included site improvements shall reinforce existing
buildings and streetscape patterns and the placement of buildings and included site
improvements shall assure there is no adverse impact on the district.
36-2.1.6
Proposed streets shall be connected to the existing district road network, wherever possible.
36-2.1.7
Open spaces within the proposed development shall reinforce open space patterns of the
district, in form and siting.
36-2.1.8
Locally significant features of the site such as distinctive buildings or sight lines of vistas from
within the district shall be integrated into the site design.
36-2.1.9
The landscape design shall complement the districts landscape patterns.
36-2.1.10
The exterior signs, site lighting and accessory structures shall support a uniform architectural
theme if such a theme exists and be compatible with their surroundings.
36-2.1.11
Town of Westport, CT
The scale, proportions, massing, and detailing of any proposed building shall be in proportion to
the scale, proportion, massing, and detailing in the district.
36-2.2 Compliance Alternative
If the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Applicant jointly agree that a proposed design
meets the compatibility objectives of §36-2.1 Design Principles but does not meet the
requirements of §36-2.3 Design Standards, the Planning and Zoning Commission may accept
the proposed design provided that it complies with the compatibility objectives §36-2.1 Design
Principles.
A Compliance Alternative must accomplish the relevant Design Principle. The Applicant must
submit documentation that indicates the specific proposed alternative method or standard that
will be used, why the Design Standards are not applicable to the application, and how the
project is fully compliant with the Design Principles. Approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission of a Compliance Alternative is discretionary, but shall not be unreasonably withheld
if the Applicant has provided sufficient documentation to justify such request. The use of the
Compliance Alternative must be by mutual consent between the Joint Committee, Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Applicant.
36-2.3 Design Standards
The following design standards shall apply to new construction, substantial reconstruction and
rehabilitation of properties, and changes that alter the exterior appearance of buildings within
the Village District and in view from public streets, walkways, bikeways or from the Saugatuck
River. Where applicable, these standards are designed to supplement existing regulations in
§33, §34 and §35 of the Zoning Regulations.
Buildings that are used as single-family homes within the Village District do not have to comply
with the following standards: §36-2.3.3 (2) - Placement and Treatment of Entries; §36-2.3.3 (6) -
Transparency; §36-2.3.3 (7) - Awnings and Signage; §36-2.3.5 - Parking; and §36-2.3.6 -
Streetscapes and Sidewalks.
36-2.3.1 Building Placement and Orientation
1. Building Placement  Building placement shall respect existing patterns of building
placement for the street on which they are located and define the edges of streets and public
spaces. The individuality of the building shall be subordinated to the overall continuity of the
streets and public spaces. Buildings shall be placed to conceal parking at the interior or rear
of building lots.
2. Building Setbacks  Infill buildings shall match the setback from the front lot line of the
immediately adjacent buildings. If the setbacks do not match, the infill building may match
one or the other, or may be an average of the two setbacks. See Figure 36 A.
Town of Westport, CT
Figure 36A Setbacks for Infill Buildings
3. Building Orientation  Buildings shall be oriented with the primary building façade(s) facing
the primary street frontage(s) of the site. Building massing and façades shall be designed to
frame streets and public spaces to provide a sense of spatial enclosure and to define street
edges. Building entrances, storefronts and windows shall be oriented to the primary street(s)
with transparency to streets and public spaces.
4. Design Treatment of Edges  Buildings that are not physically adjoined to abutters shall
treat side yards and the spaces between buildings in a manner consistent with existing
patterns of use, in terms of setbacks and use. Landscaping shall be used to define street
edges and to buffer and screen edges that may have a negative visual impact, such as
parking or loading areas. Access driveways and curb cuts using side yards may be
combined between adjoining properties to access parking for multiple buildings at the interior
of the block.
36-2.3.2 Building Massing and Form
1. Relationship to Existing Context  Building massing, form, and scale shall be
complementary to and respectful of the patterns of existing buildings in the immediate
vicinity. See Figure 36 B.
Town of Westport, CT
Figure 36B Relationship to existing contents and building form.
2. Building Form  The shape and massing of new and renovated buildings shall provide a
balance among building height, story-height, building width and block width. The shape and
massing of the building shall complement the abutting structures and define the edges of
streets and open spaces. See Figure 36 B.
3. Scale  The scale of proposed new or substantially rehabilitated buildings shall be
compatible with the surrounding architecture and landscape context. Elements that may help
to relate building massing proportionally shall include: articulated building bases through a
change in material or color; placement of windows in a regular pattern; articulation of
building entries with canopies, porches or awnings, and façade and roof projections (such as
bay windows or dormers).
4. Proportion  The proportions of building elements shall be generally compatible with
existing structures and the features and components of the façade.
5. Height  Infill buildings visible from public streets, public spaces, walkways, bikeways or the
Saugatuck River shall continue the patterns of height of adjacent existing properties. Where
the discrepancy between the proposed height and existing height patterns is greater than
ten feet, the Joint Committee shall review design proposals with the Applicant for context
sensitivity based upon the following: articulation of façade; building mass, scale, bulk and
proportion; or other building massing considerations.
6. Building Roofs  Roofing materials visible from public streets, public spaces, walkways,
bikeways or the Saugatuck River shall be of high quality and durable, including, but not
limited to: slate, copper, ceramic slate tile, clay tile, concrete tile, or ribbed metal or
architectural asphalt shingle. Flat horizontal roofs are exempted from this standard. Roofing
materials shall not call undue attention to the roof itself with bright or contrasting colors,
unless historically documented. Building mechanical equipment located on building roofs,
sites, or other locations shall be not be visible from the street.
36-2.3.3 Building Façades
1. Façade Design and Relationship to Existing Context  The façade, or primary building
elevation, of new construction or substantial rehabilitation shall be compatible with the
façade design of neighboring buildings so as to create continuity across projects and the
street edge. Primary building façades with frontage along the street shall be sensitive to the
existing context of building façades along that street. At least two of the following design
elements should be repeated in adjacent buildings, excluding parking structures: design
Town of Westport, CT
treatment at the ground level, relative location and size of doors, window style and
proportions, location of signs, dominant façade material, dominant color, bay window style,
and roof form. There shall be a direct vertical correspondence between the design of the
façade of the upper floors and the ground level retail façades. New construction and
substantial rehabilitation of properties adjacent to public open spaces shall be oriented to
define the edges of those open spaces and provide a transparent ground floor to activate the
public space. See Figure 36C.
Figure 36C Façade Design and Relationship to existing context
2. Placement and Treatment of Entries  Entrances shall be oriented to the primary street
frontage and address the street with an active and welcoming entry composition that is
integrated into the overall massing and configuration of the building form. Building and shop
entrances shall be recessed to a minimum depth equal to the width of the door to prevent
doors from swinging into the sidewalk. Building entries may add components to the building
façade such as storefronts, canopies, porches, and stoops and shall provide a high level of
visibility and transparency into ground floor uses. See Figure 36 D.
Figure 36D Placement and Treatment of Entries
3. Façade Materials  Materials shall be selected to be compatible with or complementary to
the Village District. Materials on the façade that are subject to deterioration (plywood or
plastic) shall be avoided or removed and replaced. Building façade exterior materials,
including architectural trim and cladding, shall be of high quality and durable, including but
not limited to: stone, brick, wood, metal, glass, sustainable cement masonry board products
and integrated or textured masonry. Exterior material may not include vinyl siding.
Uninterrupted, multi-level glazing may not be used as a primary façade design treatment.
Repairs and alterations must not damage or destroy materials, features or finishes that are
important in defining the buildings historic character. Deteriorated historic features shall be
repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
Town of Westport, CT
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other
visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
4. Roof Parapet and Cornice Lines  Building cornice lines shall be maintained, preserved or
recreated to define building façades and create façade components consistent with historic
parapet or cornice lines as originally designed and built in Village District. See Figure 36 E.
Figure 36E Roof Parapet and Cornice Lines
5. Proportion and Pattern of Windows  Original window patterns and openings shall be
preserved or restored, including conservation and repair to preserve historical details, in the
redevelopment of existing structures. New construction shall acknowledge and respond to
existing adjacent window patterns in proportion, scale, rhythm and number of openings. See
Figure 36 F.
Figure 36F Proportion and Pattern of Windows
6. Transparency  Building façades facing the principal street or public open space shall have
at least 25% of the overall façade in transparent windows and at least 40% of the ground
floor façade in transparent windows. Along the secondary façades that face pedestrian
alleys or connections, façades must achieve at least 15% transparency. Windows on the
ground floor of the primary façade shall not be mirrored or use tinted glass or be obstructed
by curtains, shades, or blinds. See Figure 36 G on next pg.
Town of Westport, CT
Figure 36G Transparency
7. Awnings and Signage  Awnings and signs may not obscure important architectural details
by crossing over pilasters or covering windows. Multiple awnings or signs on a single
building shall be consistent in size, profile, location, material, color and design. On multitenant
buildings the awnings and signs shall be allowed to vary in color and details, but shall
be located at the same height on the building façade. See Figure 36 H.
Figure 36 H Awnings and Signage
36-2.3.4 Landscape
1. Landscape Use and Orientation  Landscape features shall shield negative views and
define edges, and frame streets and public spaces. Plantings shall not obscure site
entrances and exit drives, access ways, or road intersections or impair visibility of
commercial storefronts. Tree species shall be selected to maintain relatively clear views of
the ground floor and adequate height clearances for sidewalk circulation. Site and landscape
features shall be integrated with the design of new construction and reflect a coordinated
site and building design.
2. Open Spaces  Public and private open spaces shall be designed, landscaped, and
furnished to be compatible with or complementary to the overall character of the Village
District.
3. Site and Street Edges  New landscape strips with street trees, street trees in sidewalk tree
wells, or landscaped medians shall be consistent with the existing landscape patterns of the
Town of Westport, CT
location of proposed improvements. Landscape strips and sidewalk tree wells shall be of
sufficient width to promote the health of street trees and other plantings.
4. Views  Buildings shall be designed and located on the site so as to preserve views to the
Saugatuck River.
5. Rain Gardens  Rain gardens may be provided as a contributing element of the site
drainage, and integrated into the overall site. The plantings should be well adapted to
wetland edge environments, including grasses, hedges, shrubs, or trees that tolerate
intermittent wet conditions and extended dry periods. The design should prevent long-term
standing water that would damage the plantings.
36-2.3.5 Parking
1. Parking Placement  Parking shall be located at the interior of blocks, behind buildings, or
at the rear of sites, away from prominent site edges, public spaces, and streets. See Figure
36 I.
Figure 36 I Parking Placement
2. Screening and Landscaping  Parking areas shall be separated from the street with
landscaped buffers of between five feet and eight feet in width. Parking areas on secondary
streets may also be screened by other site components, including fences, gates, walls,
permanent planters, or hedges. Landscaped medians shall be provided between parking
spaces to break up the impervious surfaces and mitigate the visual impact of parking. No
landscape island shall be less than 6 wide with a minimum width of 10 is required for
planting strips with trees. See Figure 36 J.
Figure 36 J Screening and Landscaping
3. Structured Parking  Structured parking, where provided, shall be at the interior of a block,
surrounded on visible edges by active uses to avoid inactive street edges created by the
parking structure. Alternatively, the structured parking could be arranged such that the
ground floor area facing the main street is available for commercial space.
Town of Westport, CT
4. Curbs and Curb Cuts  Granite curbs shall be used to protect planting areas and to define
sidewalks, walkways, and parking area edges. Curb cuts shall be minimized and combined
whenever possible. Every curb cut shall provide a continuous and uninterrupted pedestrian
walkway.
36-2.3.6 Streetscape and Sidewalks (See Sidewalk Ordinance, Chapter 50 of the Town
Code)
1. Pedestrian Access  New construction and public infrastructure improvements shall
reinforce a network of continuous, convenient and safe pedestrian connections along
sidewalks to and from all pedestrian entrances of all garages, parking lots and parking
structures and all public, resident, and employee entrances to every building. Sidewalks and
pedestrian paths should incorporate appropriate lighting, street furniture, landscaping, and
signage consistent with the Village District. The network should not include streets or spaces
that are primarily used for vehicular connections, deliveries and services.
2. Sidewalk Configuration  Sidewalks shall have a minimum unobstructed width of 4-0.
Sidewalks shall be widened to accommodate street trees, landscaping, and outdoor
furnishing and amenities. Sidewalks shall be continuous and uninterrupted at driveways and
curb cuts to reinforce priority for pedestrians. See Figure 36 K.
Figure 36 K Sidewalk Configuration
3. Special Paving  Unit pavers may be used to enhance the character of sidewalks,
pathways, and plazas. Existing brick or pavers shall be maintained or replaced and shall be
introduced if adjacent sidewalks are brick. When employed, unit pavers should be selected
and set in a manner that limits uneven surfaces or joints that would become an impediment
to accessibility. An acceptable method includes providing a sub-base of wire-mesh
reinforced concrete below the setting bed, and mortared joints. See Figure 36 L.
Figure 36 L Special Paving
4. Passageways  Passageways through buildings that connect the principal streets to
parking shall include displays relevant to adjacent businesses, public art, and/or wayfinding
Town of Westport, CT
signage related to the Village District and lighting that provides a safe environment for
pedestrians.
5. Street Furniture  Permanent street furniture including light fixtures, benches, bike racks,
trash and recycling receptacles, and newspaper stands shall be integrated with street and
sidewalk circulation to ensure adequate clearances, access and convenience of the location
of these amenities. Street furniture shall be clustered at convenient locations that are plainly
visible and accessible and must be located such that the minimum 4-0 sidewalk clearances
are maintained.
6. Public Art  Public art may be used to define and punctuate public spaces. Art installations
shall maintain clearances in public spaces, and be constructed of materials that are durable,
easily maintained and that do not present safety hazards.
7. Sidewalk Cafés  Where sidewalk width is constrained at location of sidewalk use for
outdoor cafés, the Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the minimum clear width of
the sidewalk to 3 for a maximum length of 10. After a 5 interval of a minimum width of 4,
the minimum clearance of 3 may be allowed for another 10. The goal is to maintain the
balance for clear width of pedestrian activity and the extension of outdoor cafés into the
public space.

Commission or Conservation Director, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not render its
decision on such application until the Conservation Commission or Conservation Director has
submitted a report with it final decision.
43-6.4 Hiring of Outside Consultants
The Planning and Zoning Director, his/her designee, or the Planning and Zoning Commission
may require an applicant to pay for hiring one or more outside consultants to assist the Planning
and Zoning staff and Commission in analyzing, reviewing, and reporting on areas requiring
technical review.
Town of Westport, CT
1. Upon the filing of an application, the Planning and Zoning Director, or his/her designee, shall
make a determination whether one or more consultant(s) are needed to analyze, review and
report on areas requiring technical review in order to assist the Commission. Such
consultant(s) may include, but shall not be limited to engineers, surveyors, soil scientists,
traffic consultants and information technologists.
If such determination is made, the Director shall assess the reasonable costs for such
consultant(s) to the applicant based upon a preliminary estimate from the consultant(s). The
Director shall collect 150% of the estimate from the applicant, which amount shall be held in
escrow until the technical review(s) are completed. Any excess amount collected over the
actual cost shall be refunded to the applicant. This payment shall be considered as an
integral component of the application. The failure by the applicant to make this payment
shall render the application incomplete.
2. The Planning and Zoning Commission may also make a determination whether one or more
outside consultant(s) are needed in the event that the Director does not make such a
determination, or in the event that the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that one
or more additional outside consultant(s) are needed. Prior to making such a determination,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine:
a. That the evidence in the record of the proceedings has been produced or is likely to be
produced which requires the hiring of such consultant(s);
b. That the department staff will be unable to perform the technical review; and
c. That adequate time exists for the applicant to review and respond to such consultant(s)
report(s).
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall then make such a reasonable assessment
and collect 150% of the estimate from the applicant. Any excess amount collected over
the actual costs shall be refunded to the applicant. This payment shall be considered as
an integral component of the application. The failure by the applicant to make this
payment shall render the application subject to denial as incomplete.

46-9 Effective Date
46-1 Purpose of the Board
The Zoning Board of Appeals is an agency, separate from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, engaged in, and necessary to the proper administration of the zoning regulations.
The Zoning Board of Appeals is an administrative agency which exercises quasi-judicial
functions to provide relief in cases where literal application of the Zoning Regulations acts
peculiarly on a particular piece of property to produce an undue hardship on that property under
special circumstances and to provide a local review for questions arising from zoning
enforcement. The exercise of the Board's power to vary the zoning regulations is guided by
statute and by general rule of law as well as local zoning conditions.
46-2 Establishment of the Board
On the basis of the foregoing, the Zoning Board of Appeals in Westport, established pursuant to
the Connecticut General Statutes and the Westport Town Charter, shall have all the powers and
duties prescribed by law and these regulations.
46-3 Powers and Duties
46-3.1 Appeals
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is any
error in any order, requirement, or decision regarding the enforcement of these regulations
made by the official charged with zoning enforcement. Such appeals shall be made within thirty
(30) days of the decision appealed from. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to permit
any person, otherwise entitled to appeal to the Superior Court an order, requirement or decision
of the Planning and Zoning Commission to appeal such order, requirement or decision to the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
46-3.2 Variances
Town of Westport, CT
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine and may vary the application of the zoning
regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent and with due consideration for
conserving the public health, safety, convenience, welfare and property values solely with
respect to a parcel of land where owing to conditions especially affecting such parcel but not
affecting generally the district in which it is situated, a literal enforcement of such zoning
regulations would result in exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship, so that substantial justice
will be done and public safety and welfare secured; provided, however, that in no case may a
variance be granted which permits a commercial use in a district in which such use is not
otherwise allowed by these regulations, including the extension of a non-conforming commercial
use.
46-3.2.1
Whenever an application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a use, a
structure or activity which lies either wholly or partially within the Coastal Area, the Zoning Board
of Appeals shall review a Coastal Site Plan to assure compliance with §31-10 of these
regulations and with the CAM Act. The Statutory requirement for a Coastal Site Plan Review
shall not be varied by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
46-3.2.2
Whenever an applicant requests a variance from §31-11, Flood Plain Regulations, the following
provisions shall apply:

such damage on the individual owner;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent
facility;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;

Easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width, or greater if required by the Town Engineer, shall
also be provided for any storm water or sanitary sewer pipes to be installed in proposed private
streets of rights-of-way when such pipes serve an existing public street or a proposed street that
may be proposed for acceptance by the Town. Easements shall also be installed in the future to
serve undeveloped land within the watershed that normally drains across the area of the
proposed subdivision.
54-19 Channel Encroachment Lines
Channel encroachment lines shall be provided along any brook, stream or river for the purpose
of preventing encroachment upon and construction of the natural water channel or flood prone
areas by buildings, structures, filling or other activities, facilities and construction. The channel
encroachment lines shall be based on sound engineering calculations anticipating a 25-year
storm and/or 100-year flood potential and recognizing proper alignment and gradients of the
channel. A note shall be placed on the subdivision map explaining the channel encroachment
lines and stating the restrictions against building, structure, and activity encroaching upon the
channel.
54-20 Pedestrian and Conservation Easements
54-20.1 Public Access Easements
In subdivisions where the proposed street system does not conform to the anticipated pattern of
pedestrian circulation, particularly in the vicinity of schools, parks, playgrounds and open space,
the Commission may require the provision of easements of at least ten (10) feet in width for the
establishment of pedestrian ways for public access.
54-20.2 Conservation Easements
In subdivisions where there are environmentally sensitive and/or ecologically fragile natural
resources such as wetlands, steep slopes in excess of 25% or scenic vistas, the Commission
shall require the provision of appropriate conservation easements, as deemed necessary, to
protect and preserve such natural resources and in locations deemed proper by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. Unless approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, within the
area of the easement, it shall not be permitted to: (a) erect, build or place any buildings or other
structures on the land, (b) disturb the topography of the land within said area from its present
condition, (c) alter the vegetation (d) dump trash or any unsightly or offensive material.
54-20.3 Location of Easements
The locations and boundaries of any such easements shall be clearly shown on the subdivision
map and physically identified on the ground with monuments where appropriate.
54-21 Park, Recreation and Open Space Areas
Town of Westport, CT
Land for park, recreation and open space areas shall be provided and reserved in each
subdivision as deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning Commission and in locations
deemed proper by the Commission. The amount of open space for these purposes shall not
exceed 10% of the total acreage of the subdivision. The land reserved shall be of such location,
shape, topography and general character as to be usable to satisfy the needs determined by the
Commission. Proper pedestrian reservation of land shall also conform to any Plan of
Conservation and Development pertaining to parks, playgrounds, recreation areas and open
spaces.
Land for open space may be deeded as follows:
1. To the town for active or passive recreational purposes or for conservation; or
2. To a private association (such as a nature conservancy or the Aspetuck Land Trust) legally
constituted for conservation purposes; or
3. To a private association consisting of the owner(s) of the lot(s) within the subdivision or
resubdivision for a use determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
54-21.1 Payments in lieu of open space.
As provided under Section 8-25 and 8-25b of the Connecticut General Statutes, the
Commission may authorize the applicant to pay a fee to the town or pay a fee to the town and
transfer land to the town in lieu of any requirement to provide open space in the subdivision.
Such payment or combination of payment and the fair market value of the land to be transferred
shall be equal to ten per cent of fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the
approval of the subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser jointly
selected by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant, but the cost of such
appraisal shall be paid by the applicant. Instead of an appraiser the Town Assessor could
determine the current market value upon agreement of the applicant and the Commission. This
value would be binding upon the parties. A fraction of such payment in lieu of open space, the
numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved lots in the
subdivision, shall be made at the time of the sale of each approved lot in the subdivision and
placed in a fund which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring
additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
54-21.2 Exceptions
As provided in Section 8-25(a) of the Connecticut General Statutes, the open space
requirement of this section shall not apply if the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than
five parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle or first
cousin for no consideration, or if the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in
section 8-39a of the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty per cent or more of the total
housing to be constructed in such subdivision.
54-22 Flood Prone Areas
If a proposed subdivision is located in a flood prone area, as designated on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) as published by the Federal Emergency Management
1. it shall be designed to minimize the impact on the flood prone area;
2. all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
Town of Westport, CT
3. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. For residential
structures the lowest floor (including cellar or basement elevation) must be equal to, or
above, the base flood level.
For non-residential structures the lowest floor (including cellar or basement elevation) must be
elevated or flood-proofed to or above these minimum finished floor elevations. Non-compliance
with these elevations shall preclude the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance and/or a
Certificate of Occupancy. Base flood level data shall be utilized from the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) in Flood Zone A1-A30 and V1-V30 in Flood Zone A the base flood level data from
alternative sources shall be reasonably utilized.
54-23 Aquifer Impact
In order to help maintain drinking water standards, sanitary wastewater discharge into on-site
septic disposal systems should not average more than 350 gallons per gross acre per day
within that portion of the primary recharge area of the Saugatuck River Aquifer located north of
the Kings Highway Bridge (State Rt. 57) as shown in the "Guide to Ground Water & Aquifer
Protection" report for Westport by SWRPA dated July, 1980. Larger average discharges may
require either the installation of community sewerage systems or public sanitary sewers or the
construction of smaller buildings i.e. fewer bedrooms or less gross floor area.
54-24 Solar Access and Design
The purpose of this section is to encourage energy conservation, energy-efficient patterns of
development and land use, and the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy.
54-24.1 Standards and Conditions
In addition to the other design standards and improvement requirements of these regulations, all
subdivisions or re-subdivisions of land involving 4 or more building lots or 5 or more acres,
whichever is greater, shall conform to the following standards and conditions:
54-24.1.1 Lot Lines
Insofar as practicable, the side lot lines of all lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street
on which the lot has frontage unless the purpose of lot line orientation is to secure greater solar
access or protection or control thereof.
54-24.1.2 Street Layout
Streets should, in general, follow the contour of the land and should have a location and grade
which accomplishes an attractive layout and development of the land, which preserves natural
terrain, large isolated trees and desirable woods and other vegetation; and which will enhance
property values in the subdivision. When few natural constraints exist which limit street layout
and location such as, but not limited to, steep slopes and unsuitable soils, streets should have
an east-west orientation to the greatest extent possible with acceptable variations of ten (10)
degrees to the northwest and twenty five (25) degrees to the southwest in order to provide for
orientation of lots and buildings to the south, and thereby to encourage the use of solar energy
systems.
54-24.1.3 Building Location and Orientation
The location and orientation of proposed principal residential buildings shall be such that each
building has maximum solar access, i.e. the longest building wall should be south oriented.
Town of Westport, CT
54-24.1.4 Septic System
Septic system should be located on the south side of the house in order to protect the future
solar access by removing trees and other vegetative cover that would cast a shadow on the
building.
54-24.1.5 Natural Vegetation
The removal of large isolated trees and desirable woods and other vegetation, particularly those
existing plant materials which serve as wind barriers and aid energy conservation, should be
avoided.

55-1 Approval of Improvements
All streets, drainage, sewers and other required subdivision improvements shall be designed
and constructed as provided herein and shall be subject to approval by the Commission and the
Town Engineer.
55-2 Street Construction and Design
All streets, including Arterial, Collector and Minor streets, and including private streets serving
six (6) or more lots, shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the Requirements for
the Acceptance of Roads by the Town of Westport adopted by the Representative Town
Meeting on Sept. 9, 1964, as amended. Roads in private rights-of-way serving two (2) to five (5)
lots only shall also be designed and constructed in accordance with such Regulations and
Specifications, except that the aggregate total width of traveled path and gutters may be
reduced to twenty (20) feet, subject to approval of the Town Engineer.
55-3 Storm Drainage Construction and Design
Storm drainage in connection with Arterial, Collector and Minor streets and in connection with
private streets serving six (6) or more lots, shall be provided, designed and constructed in
accordance with Requirements for the Acceptance of Roads by the Town of Westport, adopted
by the Representative Town Meeting on Sept. 9, 1964, as amended. Private rights-of-way
serving two (2) to five (5) lots shall be provided with such storm drainage as may be determined
necessary by the Town Engineer to prevent erosion, to prevent storm water from crossing the
traveled path and to provide adequate collection and disposal of storm water where the private
right-of-way joins with an existing public street or a street that may be proposed for acceptance
by the Town. Storm drainage in the subdivision shall also be designed and constructed in
accordance with the following standards:
55-3.1 Design
Town of Westport, CT
The minimum criteria for the design of all storm drainage systems and facilities shall be a 25-
year storm and the maximum allowable total coverage.
55-3.1.1
Where it is anticipated that the additional run-off resulting from the development of a subdivision
will overload an existing drainage facility during a 10-year design storm flow, the Commission
shall not approve the subdivision unless and until provision has been made for the improvement
of said condition.
55-3.1.2
Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to achieve at least a zero impact runoff based on a
minimum 25 year storm flood, unless otherwise approved by both the Flood and Erosion Control
Board and the Town Engineer.
55-3.1.3
Street culverts and bridges shall be designed for a 100-year storm flow.
55-3.2 Pipe
Sufficient storm water pipe shall be installed within the subdivision to drain the proposed streets
and to carry existing watercourses within the subdivision area. If in its judgment there will be no
substantial danger from soil erosion or danger to the public health and safety, the Commission
may permit the discharge of rivers and large streams in their natural courses and may permit
the discharge of storm water and established watercourses in open ditches across proposed
lots. All pipes and ditches shall be of such size, material and construction as will be sufficient to
properly carry storm water expected to enter the pipe or ditch from the proposed subdivision
and from other properties when developed which normally drain across the area of the
proposed subdivision. Such pipe shall not be less than 15 inches in diameter with a minimum
slope of 0.5% unless otherwise approved by the Town Engineer. The Commission may require
the installation of additional drainage facilities, such as a detention pond, in order to maintain a
zero runoff impact, in the subdivision where necessary to prevent flooding or soil erosion, to
protect the public health and safety and to make the lots suitable for occupancy.
55-3.3 Discharge
The discharge of all storm water shall be into suitable streams or rivers or into Town or State
Highway drains with adequate capacity to carry the additional water. Where the discharge shall
be into or through private property, proper easements and discharge rights shall be secured by
the applicant. Where the discharge into or through private property consists of any storm water
coming from an existing public street or a proposed street other than a private street or right-ofway,
such easements and discharge rights shall also be secured by the applicant for the Town.
55-4 Sanitary Sewers
Town of Westport, CT
The Commission may require the installation of sanitary sewers in any subdivision located
within or reasonably close to the public sanitary sewer system of the Town. Installation of new

REGULATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION
OF WETLANDS AND WATERCOURSES
WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT
1.0 TITLE, AUTHORITY, AND PURPOSE
1.1 These Regulations shall be known as the "Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
of the Town of Westport, Connecticut."
1.2 These Regulations as amended from time to time have been prepared and are adopted
in accordance with the provisions of Section 22a-42c of the Connecticut General Statutes
and were adopted by the Westport Conservation Commission and became effective on
April 27, 1973.
1.3 The wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the State have been
endowed. The inland wetlands and watercourses constitute an interrelated web of nature
that is essential to maintaining an adequate supply of surface and underground water, to
hydrological stability and flooding and erosion control, to the recharging and purification
of groundwater and to ensuring the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant
life.
Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of
destruction due to unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of
material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures, and other
uses which have despoiled, polluted, and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. This
unregulated activity has, and will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the
environment and ecology of the Town of Westport. Furthermore, it will, if unchecked,
imperil the quality of the environment and adversely affect the ecological, scenic, historic
and recreational value and benefits of Westport for its citizens now and in perpetuity.
1.4 The preservation and protection of wetlands and watercourses from random
unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public
interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of Westport and
the State. It is therefore the purpose of these Regulations to protect the citizens of
Westport by making provisions for the care, preservation, maintenance, and use of local
wetlands and watercourses of Westport. They provide an orderly process through which to
balance the need for economic growth and land use in Westport with the need to protect
its environment and ecology for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Westport and
generations yet unborn.
This purpose can be met by:
(a) Minimizing the disturbance and pollution of wetlands and watercourses;
(b) Maintaining or improving water quality in accordance with the standards set by
Federal, State or Local authority;
2
(c) Preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation;
(d) Preventing loss of fish and other beneficial organisms, wildlife and vegetation;
(e) Preventing the destruction of natural habitats;
(f) Controlling discharges and runoff to deter and inhibit pollution and flooding;
(g) Protecting the conservation, economic, recreational and aesthetic quality of
wetlands and watercourses to maintain their public and private uses and values; and
(h) Protecting potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft,
pollution, misuse and mismanagement.

final review of an application for a regulated activity.
A reporting form shall be completed during the application process, which provides the
Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection with information
necessary to properly monitor the inventory of State wetlands. The reporting form shall
be part of the application and specified sections shall be completed by the applicant. The
Commission shall be responsible for the remaining information and any corrections on
the form prior to filing it with the State.
9.1.2 All information submitted in the application for review shall be considered factual
and binding.
A knowing failure on the part of the applicant or any of his/her agents to provide correct
or complete information during the application procedure shall be grounds for denial of
the license.
9.1.3 The date of application receipt shall be deemed the date of the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Conservation Commission, immediately following the day of
submission, or thirty-five (35) days after submission, whichever is sooner, provided the
information has been submitted thirty-four (34) days before such regularly scheduled
meeting.
9.1.4 All applications shall include in addition to such other information as may from
time to time be required by the Commission, the following information, in writing, and
on a form provided by the Commission:
(a) The applicant's name, home and business addresses, and home and business

(3) In the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland
or watercourse resources.
(g) Plan(s) or map(s) of the property containing sufficient detail to enable the
Commission to carry out its duties under these Regulations and showing: regulated
area(s) including setbacks, proposed activity(ies), including any further activities
associated with, or reasonably related to, and made inevitable by the proposed
regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands and watercourses;
(h) Names and addresses of all adjacent property owners;
(i) Stamped envelopes addressed to adjacent property owners.
9.1.5 Payment of application fee. An application will not be deemed complete nor
placed on an agenda until the application fee, assessed pursuant to Section 46-
1E of the Code of the Town of Westport, as may be amended from time to time,
has been paid in full.
9.1.6 Fee for Technical Assistance. Upon the filing of an application, the
Conservation Director, or his/her designee, shall make a determination whether
an outside expert is needed to analyze, review and report on areas requiring
technical review in order to assist the Commission. Such experts may include,
but shall not be limited to, engineers, surveyors, soil scientists, wetland
biologists, wildlife biologists, and hydrogeologists. If such determination is
made, the Director may assess the reasonable cost for such expert to the
applicant based upon a preliminary estimate from the expert. The Director may
collect 150% of the estimate from the applicant, which amount shall be held in
escrow until the technical review is completed. The amount will be the outside
limit of the applicants responsibility. Any excess amount collected over the
actual cost shall be refunded to the applicant. This payment shall be considered
as an integral component of the application. The failure by the applicant to
make this payment shall render the application incomplete.
In the event the Director does not make a determination that an outside expert is
needed, the Commission may make such a determination up to two (2) weeks
after the commencement of the public hearing on the application. However,
prior to making such a determination, the Commission shall determine: 1) that
evidence in the record of the proceedings has been produced or is likely to be
produced which requires the hiring of such an expert; 2) that the department
staff will be unable to perform the technical review; and 3) that adequate time
exists for the applicant to review and respond to such experts report. The
Conservation Commission shall then make such a reasonable assessment and
collect 150% of the estimate from the applicant. Any excess amount collected
over the actual cost shall be refunded to the applicant. This payment shall be
considered as an integral component of the application. The failure by the
applicant to make this payment shall render the application incomplete.
If adequate time is not possible for the outside expert to perform the analysis

classified by either the Commission or the Conservation Director as requiring a
declaratory ruling, a summary ruling or a plenary ruling pursuant to Sections 9.3, 9.4 and
9.5 of these Regulations.
9.3 Declaratory Ruling: - Any person wishing to carry out a proposed activity or use on
property containing regulated areas, who believes that the proposed activity or use is not
an activity requiring a permit shall seek a Declaratory Ruling from the Commission. Any
such request for a Declaratory Ruling shall be submitted in writing on a form supplied by
the Department, and signed by the person wishing to carry out the proposed activity or
use, and accompanied by a plan showing the proposal. This permission shall be subject
to conditions or revocation if the proposed activity has the potential for significant impact
on a wetland or watercourse. The Commission or Department shall state in writing its
reasons for finding that a proposed use or other activity does not involve a regulated
activity as defined in Section 3.18 of these Regulations.
9.3.1 The Commission may delegate to the Conservation Department the authority to
approve or extend an activity or use that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when
the Department finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater than a
minimal impact on any wetlands or watercourse, provided that the Conservation
Department staff member has completed the Comprehensive Training Program
developed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection pursuant to Section 22a-39
of the Connecticut General Statutes.
9.3.2 Failure to have a member of the Conservation Department Staff with training by the
Commissioner's Program shall not affect the validity of any action of the Department or
Commission.
9.3.3 Any person receiving such approval from the Conservation Department shall,
within ten (10) days of the date of such Declaratory Ruling, publish, at the applicant's
expense, notice of the approval in the newspaper having general circulation in the town
wherein the activity is located or will have an effect. Any person may appeal such
decision of the Conservation Department to the Commission within fifteen (15) days after
the publication date of the notice and the Commission shall consider such appeal at its
next regularly scheduled meeting provided such meeting is no earlier than three (3)
business days after receipt of the appeal. The Commission shall, at its discretion, sustain,
alter or reject the decision of the Department or require an application for a permit in
accordance with Section 9.4 inclusive of these Regulations.
9.4 Summary Ruling: If the Commission or the Director finds after initial review that a
proposed activity is a regulated activity not involving significant impact or major effect
on wetlands and watercourses, it may allow the activity with or without conditions. In
order to grant a permit at this stage the Commission, after full review of the
considerations set forth in Sections 9.5.1 through 9.5.7 inclusive, shall issue an opinion

conditions or denying a permit by certified mail within fifteen (15) days of the date of
such decision. The Commission shall cause notice of the issuance or denial of a permit to
be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the Town of Westport.
9.9 The failure of the Commission or the Conservation Department to act upon any
application within the time prescribed by these Regulations shall not be considered an
approval. An application deemed incomplete by the Commission must either be
withdrawn by the applicant or denied by the Commission.
9.10 Once the Commission has taken action on an application, any further consideration
of the same area or activity shall be permitted only upon showing either that a change of
conditions has occurred since the decision or the prior application, or that other
considerations materially affecting the merits of the subject matter have intervened.
9.11 If the Commission or Department finds that an activity for which it has granted a
permit has had a more severe impact or effect on wetlands or watercourses than was
projected by the applicant, or does not, in fact, involve a permitted use, the Commission
may revoke such permit and require the permit holder to submit a new application for
review.
10.0 RENDERING DECISION AFTER REVIEW
10.1 The Commission shall consider the following in making its final decision on a
permit application:
(a) All evidence offered at or before any public hearing;
(b) Any reports from the Commission's agents, other Commissions and/or Federal or
State agencies, including the Soil and Water Conservation Districts and the
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection;
(c) Additional requested information;
(d) All relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to criteria in
furtherance of the purposes and policies of these Regulations as set forth in Sections
5.0 and 6.0 inclusive;

and provide recreation and open space;
(h) The extent to which the exercises of property rights and the public benefit derived
Inland Wetland and Watercourse Regulations Effective Date: August 9, 2004
23
from such use may or may not outweigh or justify the possible degradation of the
wetland or watercourse, the interference with the exercise of other property rights
and the impairment or endangerment of public health, safety or welfare.
10.2 The Commission shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated
activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on
aquatic, plant or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical
characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses as defined in Section 5.2.
11.0 GRANTING A PERMIT
11.1 In the case of an application which has received a public hearing pursuant to a
finding by the Conservation Commission that the proposed activity may have a
significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the
Commission finds on the basis of record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not
exist. In the making of this finding, the Commission shall consider the facts and
circumstances set forth in Section 10.1. The finding and the reasons thereof shall be
stated in the meeting record in writing.
11.2 In granting a permit or granting a permit with conditions following a public hearing,
the Conservation Commission shall issue a written opinion presenting the reasons for
granting such permit. The opinion may include discussion of applicable factors listed in
Section 10.1. The Commission may grant the application as filed, or upon such terms,
conditions, limitations or modifications as are designed to carry out the policy expressed
in the Regulations or Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes. Such terms may include any reasonable measures, including but not limited to,
recreational, open space and conservation easements, which would mitigate the impacts
of the regulated activity, by:
(a) Preventing or minimizing pollution or other environmental damage:
(b) Maintaining or enhancing existing environmental quality; or
(c) In the following order of priority: restoring, enhancing and creating productive
wetland or watercourse resources.

12.2 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may
be feasible or prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less
adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Commission shall propose on the record,
in writing, the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this
Regulation shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that
he/she is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated
activity.
12.3 The Commission's opinion in denying a permit without prejudice, may include
permission for the applicant to modify, amend or correct the proposal.

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Representative Town Meeting of the Town of Westport 12-
6-88. Amendments noted where applicable.]
148-1. Purpose
This chapter is hereby adopted by the Representative Town Meeting of the Town
of Westport in order to protect all waterways of the Town of Westport from
activities that would cause hazards to life and property and/or activities having
adverse impact upon the flood-carrying and water-storage capacity of the
waterways and flood-plains, the flood heights and the natural resources and
ecosystems of the Town of Westport, including but not limited to ground- and
surface water, animal, plant and aquatic life, nutrient exchange and energy flow,
with due consideration given to the results of similar encroachments constructed
along the reach of the waterway.
148-2. Definitions
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
PERMITTED USE-Any use of a waterway which does not disturb the natural and
indigenous character of the waterway and is for the purpose of maintenance,
conservation or restoration of property and drainage of soil, vegetation, water,
fish, shellfish and wildlife, gardening or landscaping and does not involve
disposition of material or fill.
WATERWAY-Any river, stream, brook, watercourse or tributary, both fluvial
and tidal, including any contiguous backwater, pond or other body of water or any
floodplain, swamp, marsh, bog or other wetlands.
WATERWAY PROTECTION LINES-Those lines defining the limits of a
waterway between which no person, firm or corporation shall carry on or permit
to be carried on an activity except as may be permitted by this chapter.
148-3. Establishment and determination
A. Waterway protection lines are hereby established on both sides of all
waterways in the Town of Westport and are set at the twenty-five-yearstorm
flood elevation (mean sea level datum) along each edge of the
waterway, except that the clear horizontal distance from the twenty-fiveyear-
storm flood elevation of any such waterway shall be fifteen (15)
additional feet on each side of the following waterways:
(1) Saugatuck River
(2) West branch of the Saugatuck River
Waterway Protection Line Ordinance, Town of Westport
Page 3 of 8
(3) Aspetuck River
(4) Stony Brook
(5) Muddy Brook
(6) Deadmans Brook
(7) Sasco Brook
(8) Indian River
(9) Poplar Plains Brook
(10) Pussy Willow Brook
(11) Silver Brook
(12) Willow Brook
(13) New Creek
B. The determination of the elevation of the twenty-five-year-storm shall take
into consideration the effects of probable future developments.
C. The position of the lines may vary from the twenty-five-year-storm
elevation so as to minimize the area of land to be regulated when a portion
of the inundated area below said elevation does not contribute to the floodcarrying
capacity of the waterway.
D. When the existing waterway, because of natural or man-made
constrictions, is such that such lines cannot be established by standard
engineering methods, a channel may be adopted, whereby the removal of
such constrictions may be anticipated so that a reasonable delineation of
the twenty-five-year-storm elevation may be established.
E. When the twenty-five-year-flood boundary falls along the channel banks,
the lines shall be placed at the top of each bank along the waterway.
F. In no case shall a waterway protection line be less than fifteen (15)
horizontal feet from each edge of the waterway or top of bank, whichever
is greater.
148-4. Stream improvement projects.
Notwithstanding the provisions of 148-3 above, in areas in which Muddy Brook
or West Parish tributary are improved under a stream-improvement project to
hold a twenty-five-year-storm within its banks, the waterway protection lines
shall be set at three (3) horizontal feet from the top of the bank of the improved
waterway.
148-5. Regulated activities.
The following activities are regulated within said waterway protection lines:
dumping, filling and transferring of any materials and the encroachment by any
construction, building or portion of a building or other permanent structure(s)
within said waterway protection lines.
Waterway Protection Line Ordinance, Town of Westport
Page 4 of 8
148-6. Permitted activities.
A. If the Town Engineer finds that the proposed use, activity or project does not
have adverse impact on flooding, drainage, erosion or the natural carrying and
water-storage capacity of the waterway and involves only a permitted use as
defined herein, then a recommendation for administrative approval subject to
the appropriate conditions, shall be made by the Town Engineer and
forwarded to the Conservation Director. If the Conservation Director finds
that the proposed use, activity or project does not have adverse impact on the
natural resources and ecosystems of the waterway and the project involves
only a permitted use as defined herein, then an administrative approval shall
be issued by the Conservation Director, subject to the appropriate conditions.
B. Replacement or repair of any previously existing buildings or structures which
do not conform to this chapter which are subsequently damaged or destroyed
due to natural causes shall be permitted, provided that the replacement or
repair of any such nonconforming building or structure shall be commenced
within nine (9) months after the damage or destruction. In addition, the plans
for such replacement or repair must be approved by the Conservation Director
and the Town Engineer. Such nonconforming buildings or structures shall not
be extended or expanded, except to raise the finished floor elevations to
conform to the requirements of the federal government which are imposed as
conditions for the construction of flood control projects.
C. Projects involving maintenance of existing structures(s) or restoration of
natural resources which are approved by the Conservation Director and the
Town Engineer shall be permitted within said waterway protection lines,
provided that they are in compliance with current laws and regulations. Such
nonconforming building or structure shall not be extended or expanded,
except to raise the finished floor elevations to conform to the requirements of
the federal government which are imposed as conditions for the construction
of flood control projects.
148-7. Approval required for conduct of regulated activities.
Written applications to conduct a regulated activity shall be filed with the Conservation
Department. Applications for regulated activities that are not permitted pursuant to 148-6
shall be considered by the Flood and Erosion Control Board and the Conservation
Commission. Only those regulated activities that are not permitted pursuant to 148-6 will
require the approval by both the Flood and Erosion Control Board and the Conservation
Commission. Only completed applications, on the form supplied by the town, shall be
considered by the Flood and Erosion Control Board and the Conservation Commission.
Failure of an applicant or his representative to sufficiently answer inquiries at a meeting
of either the Flood and Erosion Control Board or Conservation Commission may be
sufficient grounds for denial of an application. Each body shall render a written decision
to the Representative Town Meeting Moderator within fifteen (15) days after the second
Waterway Protection Line Ordinance, Town of Westport
Page 5 of 8
regularly scheduled meeting following the date the application is filed. Each body shall
notify the applicant by certified mail of its decision within fifteen (15) days from the date
of the decision. Failure of either body to act within the prescribed time period shall be
deemed an approval of the application by that body.
148-8. Information to be submitted to Flood and Erosion Control Board.
An applicant shall submit information to the Flood and Erosion Control Board showing
that such activity will not cause flooding, drainage, erosion and/or related conditions
hazardous to life and property and will not have an adverse impact upon the floodcarrying
and water-storage capacity of the towns waterways, including but not limited to
the impact upon flood heights, hydrological energy flow, maintenance of essential and
natural patterns of water circulation, drainage and basin configuration and maintenance of
fresh and saltwater exchange through the placement of culverts, tide gates or other
drainage or flood-control structures.
148-9. Information to be submitted to Conservation Commission.
An applicant shall submit information to the Conservation Commission showing that
such activity will not cause water pollution, erosion and/or environmentally related
hazards to life and property and will not have an adverse impact on the preservation of
the natural resources and ecosystems of the waterway, including but not limited to impact
on ground and surface water, aquifers, plant and aquatic life, nutrient exchange and
supply, thermal energy flow, natural pollution filtration and decomposition, habitat
diversity, viability and productivity and the natural rates and processes of erosion and
sedimentation.
148-10. Final decision; commencement of activity.
A. The Conservation Commission may grant or deny permission to conduct a
regulated activity based on a finding of the effect of the obstruction or
encroachment on the flood-carrying and water-storage capacity of the
waterways and floodplains, flood heights, hazards to life and property, the
protection and preservation of the natural resources and ecosystems of the
municipality, including but not limited to ground- and surface waters, animal,
plant and aquatic life, nutrient exchange and energy flow, with due
consideration given to the results of similar encroachments constructed along
the reach of the waterway.
B. The applicant may commence any permitted activity no earlier than thirty (30)
days after receipt of the final decision of the Conservation Commission.
148-11. Review of decisions by Representative Town Meeting.
The Representative Town Meeting shall have the right to review any decision(s) of the
Flood and Erosion Control Board and/or the Conservation Commission. Said right of
review shall include the ability to reverse any decision of either or both reviewing bodies.
Waterway Protection Line Ordinance, Town of Westport
Page 6 of 8
Such right of review shall be exercised only upon the written petition for review
submitted by two (2) members of the Representative Town Meeting or twenty (20)
electors of the Town of Westport, which petition must be received by the Representative
Town Meeting Moderator or Town Clerk within thirty (30) days from the date a decision
is rendered by the latter of the two (2) reviewing bodies. The receipt of such a petition
for review shall prohibit any applicant from commencing the proposed activity until
receipt of the Representative Town Meeting decision. The right to review of the
Representative Town Meeting must be exercised within (90) days after receipt of the
petition for review. The Town Clerk shall give written notice of the decision of the
Representative Town Meeting by certified mail to the applicant within fifteen (15) days
of the Representative Town meeting action. If the Representative Town fails to act on
the petition for review within the prescribed time period, the application shall be deemed
approved.
148-12. Submission of applications for final approval.
All applications submitted by the Town of Westport or by any board, commission,
department or other subdivision of the Town of Westport shall be submitted to the
Representative Town Meeting for final approval. However, such applications must first
be filed with the Conservation Department. The Conservation Department will submit
the application to the Flood and Erosion Control Board and the Town Engineer for
comments and recommendations. Each reviewing body shall submit its written decision
and recommendations to the Moderator of the Representative Town Meeting within
fifteen (15) days after the Representative Town Meetings second regularly scheduled
meeting following the date the application is filed with the Town Engineer. Failure of
either body to submit such written decision and recommendations within the prescribed
period shall be deemed an approval. In the event that one (1) or both of the bodies fails
to act within the prescribed time period, that body shall give notice to the Moderator of
the Representative Town Meeting that the applicant has been deemed approved by that
nonreviewing body. The Representative Town Meeting shall then give final approval or
denial to the application within ninety (90) days from the date of receipt by the
Moderator of the later of the written decision or notice by each body. Failure of the
Representative Town Meeting to act within the prescribed time period shall constitute an
approval of the application.
148-13. Notification of applicant and adjacent property owners required.
[Amended 10-2-1990, effective 10-12-1990]
