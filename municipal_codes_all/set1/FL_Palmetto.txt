PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Palmetto of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through 10-19-81, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the third section of Chapter 3 is 3-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 5 and 6, it will be designated as Chapter 5.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Charter and Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Terry Pine, Supervising Editor, and Linda Davis, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Steve Odem, City Clerk, and Hugh McGuire, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 07-916, adopted Feb. 26, 2007, created Div. 3 to read as herein set out. 

Sec. 2-66. - Purpose. 
    It is of paramount importance and in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare that when the city is lawfully entitled to impose a lien on a property within its jurisdiction, the city imposes the lien with the highest (most senior) priority permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 07-916, § 3, 2-26-07) 
Sec. 2-67. - Lien priority. 
    Notwithstanding anything in the code of ordinances to the contrary, any lien imposed by the city shall be given the highest, most senior, priority above all other liens presently or in the future imposed on the property, to the fullest extent permitted by law. "Highest, most senior, priority" shall refer to a priority that is equal in dignity to taxes and tax liens. 
(Ord. No. 07-916, § 3, 2-26-07) 
Sec. 2-68. - Lien period. 
    Unless otherwise expressly provided for in the provisions authorizing the imposition of a lien, a lien imposed by the city shall be treated as a mortgage and remain in force until the lien is foreclosed upon or the debt represented by the lien is paid. Should the law require a limit on the duration of such lien, the city hereby, for that purpose alone, places a thirty-year limit on the lien, or, when required by law, places whatever durational limit such law prescribes. 
(Ord. No. 07-916, § 3, 2-26-07) 
Sec. 2-69. - Code reference. 
    A reference to a provision of the Code of Ordinances, cited on the instrument used to record the lien in the public records, shall not determine the authority under which the lien is imposed. Rather, such cite shall be deemed for use for reference purposes alone, and the authority for such lien shall be the law at the time the lien was lawfully imposed, notwithstanding the reference cited in the lien instrument. 
(Ord. No. 07-916, § 3, 2-26-07) 
DIVISION 4. - AUTHORIZATION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS

(2)  A reasonable investigation has revealed that the claim is without merit. 
(b)  The city attorney is hereby authorized to settle and instruct the city clerk to pay claims against the city without further approval of the city commission when, in the city attorney's opinion: 
(1)  It is in the best interest of the city to do so; and 
(2)  There is no substantial issue of liability involved; and 
(3)  The amount is no greater than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).

Sec. 2-82. - Definitions. 
    As used in this division 2 or 3, article IV of chapter 2, the following definitions: 
    Administrative order ("AO") is an order rendered by a special magistrate that contains findings of facts, conclusions of law, and other relevant information issued in accordance with the provisions of this division. An administrative order may act as an order imposing fines and assessing costs (also referred to in this division as an OIF), when the language therein orders such fines and costs. An administrative order with such language therein shall be considered an order imposing fines (OIF) for all purposes within this division, including for purposes of recording a lien. 
    Aggrieved party means the violator or the city acting through its city commission. 
    City attorney means the legal counselor or advisor to the city. 
    City commission means the governing and legislative body of the city. 
    Code enforcement officer (CEO) means any authorized or designated agent or employee of the city whose duty it is to assure code compliance or the enforcement of the city's codes and ordinances and compliance therewith. The term "code inspector" as per F.S. § 162.04(2), and "code enforcement officer" as used herein and in division 3, sections 2-101 through 2-109 (citation ordinance) are synonymous and interchangeable. The code enforcement officers shall be designated, in writing, by the city commission. 
    Repeat violation means a violation of a provision of a city code or ordinance by a person whom a special magistrate has previously found to have violated the same provision of said code or ordinance within five (5) years prior to the subsequent charge of violation. 
    Special magistrate means a special magistrate appointed under this section. 
    Violator means the person, natural or otherwise, in violation of those portions of the City Code of Ordinances, or any ordinances not yet codified, which are within the jurisdiction of the special magistrates. A "violator" may be the owner of the property where the violation exists, the person in charge of the property where the violation exists, such as a tenant, or the person causing or otherwise responsible for the violation of the city's Code or ordinances not yet codified, regardless of whether the person is an owner or in charge. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-83. - Appointment of special magistrates. 
(a)  The city attorney shall recommend special magistrates to exercise the authority and powers set forth in this division. The city commission may appoint up to three (3) special magistrates upon recommendation by the city attorney. 
(b)  Special magistrates shall be licensed attorneys in good standing in the State of Florida. Appointments shall be made on the basis of experience or interest in code enforcement. 
(c)  (1)  The appointment of a special magistrate may be made at any time. Those appointed to serve as special magistrate shall serve for a term of two (2) years. A special magistrate may be reappointed for succeeding terms. 
(2)  Special magistrates shall serve in accordance with the provisions of this division. A special magistrate may be suspended and removed by the city commission. 
(d)  Special magistrates shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be authorized by the city commission or as are otherwise provided by law. 
(e)  The city attorney shall be legal counsel to the code enforcement officer ("CEO") and shall advise the CEO accordingly concerning the officer's duties, powers, jurisdiction, and authority. The city attorney shall assist the CEO by presenting cases to the special magistrates on an as needed basis. The city attorney shall not advise the CEO and the CEB simultaneously. The special magistrate may request to have independent legal counsel to advise it concerning its duties, powers, jurisdiction, and authority. The mayor, with consent of the commission, may appoint independent legal counsel to advise the special magistrate. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-84. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the CEO to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances of the city as established herein and in keeping with the provisions of this division. No special magistrate shall have the power to initiate enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) hereafter, if a violation of the city's codes or ordinances is found, the CEO shall notify the violator and give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The determination of a "reasonable time" shall be in the sole discretion of the CEO based on the type of violation, the facts and circumstances surrounding the violation, the length of time the violation has existed and the action reasonably necessary to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the CEO shall notify a special magistrate and request a hearing. If the violation is referred to a special magistrate, the special magistrate through its clerical staff shall schedule a hearing on the violation and written notice of such hearing shall be delivered to the violator at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled hearing as provided for by this division. If the violation is corrected and then reoccurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the CEO, the violation may be presented to the special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the CEO shall notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The CEO, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify a special magistrate and request a hearing with notice as provided for above. The violation may be presented to the special magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the special magistrate retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the special magistrate. 
(d)  If the CEO has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the CEO shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator, but regardless of the success of such effort to notify the violator, the CEO may immediately notify a special magistrate and request a hearing be held as soon as reasonably possible. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-85. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  The CEO, or at such other times as may be necessary to address administrative matters, a special magistrate may call a hearing as circumstances dictate. Minutes shall be kept of all meetings and proceedings of a special magistrate. All hearings and proceedings of the special magistrates shall be open to the public, but under no circumstances is the public generally entitled to participate in the proceedings unless they have relevant and material evidence, testimony or matters to submit and then only with the permission of the special magistrate. The city shall provide for such clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required and necessary by the special magistrates in the proper performance of their duties. 
(b)  (1)  Each case submitted to a special magistrate for hearing shall be presented on behalf of the city by either the CEO or his designee, if appropriate. 
(2)  The city shall be entitled to reimbursement of the reasonable costs of investigation and prosecution of a code enforcement action. For costs to be imposed on a violator, the CEO and/or the city attorney shall present evidence of such costs to the special magistrate, including, when applicable, such costs for reasonable legal and professional fees relating to the investigation and prosecution of an action. Before making a finding whether to impose such costs, the special magistrate shall give the violator an opportunity to dispute such evidence presented by the CEO and/or city attorney. 
a.  In instances when the violator corrects the violation prior to the hearing under this section, the special magistrate shall include in its AO any finding of costs therein as an order imposing fines and costs. The AO with such language included may be recorded in public records to constitute a lien on the property. 
b.  In instances when a second hearing is held pursuant to subsection (2) below, the special magistrate shall include all findings of costs in its Order Imposing Fine (OIF). If fines are imposed, such costs are to be in addition to the fines imposed. The OIF may be filed as authorized hereunder in public records as a lien. 
c.  The CEO and/or the city attorney need only provide evidence of costs for reimbursement at the final hearing of the special magistrate on an action (that is, at the hearing under this section for violators who have corrected the violation before such hearing, or at the hearing under section 2-87(a) below for violators who have not corrected the violation by the time of such hearing). 
d.  No costs shall be imposed in instances where the special magistrate finds that no violation exists or had existed. 
(c)  All hearing testimony shall be under oath and shall be electronically recorded. Testimony shall be taken from the CEO, the alleged violator and other parties who have relevant and material information or evidence to submit concerning the violation. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. The hearing or proceedings of the special magistrate are quasi-judicial in nature and the proper decorum, conduct and respect due such proceedings shall be rendered by all persons involved. 
(d)  At the conclusion of a hearing, the special magistrate shall render its findings and conclusions based on the evidence of record and, thereafter, within a reasonable time frame, shall issue its written "administrative order" (AO) containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein as it relates to the violation charged. The AO may include a requirement that it be complied with by a specified date, that a specific fine shall be imposed, pursuant to F.S. § 162.09(1), in the event that the violator does not comply by the specified date, and that the cost of any abatement measures performed by the city subsequent to said date may be recovered by the city. As authorized by F.S. § 162.07(2), and subsection 2-85(b) herein, the AO may include all costs incurred by the city in the prosecution of the violation. A certified copy of the AO shall be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors-in-interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors-in-interest or assigns. If an AO is recorded in the public records pursuant to this provision and it is complied with by the date specified in said AO, the special magistrate shall issue an "order acknowledging compliance" (OAC) with the AO and that OAC shall be recorded in the public records. A special magistrate is not required to issue an OAC at the hearing, but the OAC may be executed by the special magistrate as an administrative and ministerial duty. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-86. - Powers of special magistrates. 
    A special magistrate, appointed pursuant to this division, shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of the hearings; 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators, witnesses and evidence to the hearings and such subpoenas may be served by the police department of the city or by the sheriff, as may be necessary; 
(3)  Take all testimony under oath; and 
(4)  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation of the city's codes and ordinances into compliance. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-87. - Administrative fines, costs of repairs and liens. 
(a)  A special magistrate, upon notification by the CEO that an order previously entered by the said special magistrate has not been complied with by the time set forth in said order or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, shall hold a hearing to determine whether to enter an order requiring the violator to pay a fine in an amount pursuant to this division for each day the violation continues past the date set for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the CEO. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4), the special magistrate shall notify the mayor, who may authorize all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and the violator shall be charged with the reasonable cost of the repairs, along with the fine imposed hereunder. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified below. 
(b)  (1)  Any fine imposed by a special magistrate shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to this division. However, if a special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  A special magistrate may, upon application of the violator, reduce a fine it has previously imposed by order of a special magistrate, but which has not yet been recorded. Following recordation, the city commission may reduce or satisfy said fine in accordance with subparagraph (c), of this section. 
(c)  A certified copy of an OIF shall be recorded in the public records of the county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the real property on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court by the city, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this division, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this division runs in favor of the city through the city commission and the city commission may authorize the mayor to execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this division on behalf of the city and city commission. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, a special magistrate, with the approval of the city commission, may authorize the city through the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this division may be imposed or foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the Florida Constitution, but may be imposed and foreclosed upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-88. - Fees and costs associated with lien. 
    In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in connection with the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-89. - Appeals. 
    The special magistrate's administrative order finding or not finding a violation of the City's Code, and its order imposing a fine are both final orders. An aggrieved party may appeal any final order of a special magistrate to the circuit court in and for Manatee County, Florida. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to the review of the record created before the special magistrate. An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-90. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required by this division shall be provided to the alleged violator either by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested. Mailed notice shall be sent to a property owner at the address listed in the county tax collector's records for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the city by a property owner. Mailed notice to a person who is not owner of the property where the violation is located shall be to the street address of the property where the violation is located; 
(2)  By hand delivery to the violator; 
(3)  By leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above fifteen (15) years of age and informing that person of the contents of the notice, by an appropriate law enforcement officer, CEO or other person designated by the mayor. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) hereinabove, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  Notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks, (four (4) publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. Ch. 50, for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described above, such notice may be posted for at least ten (10) days in at least two (2) locations, one (1) of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(c)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice under subsection (a) hereinabove. Evidence that an attempt to provide notice under subsection (a) hereinabove, together with proof of publication or posting as provided above, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this division have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all owners of property upon which a violation exists shall be noticed of all code enforcement proceedings regardless of whether the owner or owners are the violator. Successful notice to any one property owner shall be deemed successful notice to all property owners. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, actual notice by any means shall constitute good and sufficient notice under this section. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18)

(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18)

    Any and all city CEOs shall be designated and appointed, in writing, by the mayor, or the mayor's designee. The training and qualifications necessary for designation or appointment as a CEO shall be established by and within the discretion of the office of the mayor. However, those employees of the city who may be designated as, and are qualified as, CEOs are hereby declared to include, but are not limited to, any city code inspectors or building inspectors, law enforcement officers and fire safety inspectors with jurisdiction in the city. Designation of an employee as a CEO, other than those employees who are certified law enforcement officers, does not provide the CEO with the power of arrest or subject the CEO to the provisions of F.S. §§ 943.085-943.255. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-104. - Issuance of citations and procedures. 
(a)  A CEO is authorized to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the CEO has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance of the city and that the county court will hear the charge. 
(b)  Prior to issuing a citation, a CEO shall provide notice to the violator that he has committed a violation of a code or ordinance of the city and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. The designation of a reasonable time period for correction of the violation shall be within the sole discretion of the CEO, taking into consideration and utilizing as factors for such, the nature of the violation, the circumstances surrounding the violation, the efforts necessary to reasonably correct the violation, the length of time the violation has been in effect and whether the violation is a repeat offense. Nevertheless, such time period for correction shall not exceed thirty (30) days. If upon personal investigation, a CEO finds that the violator has not corrected the violation within the time period provided in the notice, a CEO may issue a citation to the violator. A CEO does not have to provide a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if a repeat violation is found or if the CEO has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(c)  A citation issued by a CEO shall be in a form prescribed by the city and shall, as a minimum, contain: 
(1)  The date and time of issuance; 
(2)  The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued; 
(3)  The date and time the civil infraction was committed;

(8)  The applicable civil penalty, if the person elects to contest the citation (including an administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court); 
(9)  The applicable civil penalty, if the person elects not to contest the citation (including an administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court); and 
(10)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty or, alternatively, request a hearing, in writing, to contest the citation within fifteen (15) days of issuance, (on a form prescribed by the city and approved by the court), or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation and that, in such case, a judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(d)  After issuing a citation to the violator, a CEO shall deposit the original citation and one (1) copy of the citation with the county court by filing with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2(Exh. A), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 2-105. - Schedule of violations and penalties. 
    There is hereby established, attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment "A," a schedule of violations and penalties to be assessed for citations issued by a CEO. Attachment "A" is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk. A violation of a city code or ordinance listed on Attachment "A," and when enforced hereunder for any specific occurrence, is a civil infraction. The maximum civil penalty for violation of a code or ordinance listed on Attachment "A" shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), not including the administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court which shall be established and authorized for payment and receipt by administrative order. The maximum civil penalty shall not be assessed against a person who has committed a civil infraction identified on Attachment "A" and does not contest the citation. A person who has been issued a citation by a CEO may contest the issuance of that citation in county court in and for the county. The clerk of the circuit court is hereby authorized to collect said civil penalties, including an administrative fee of ten dollars ($10.00), as tendered by the violator and remit the tendered sum, less the administration fee (which the clerk of the circuit court shall retain), to the city. The provisions of the schedule (Attachment "A") may be added, amended and revised from time to time by resolution of the city commission.

(3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other lands, buildings or structures similarly situated in the same zoning district. 
(4)  The literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this article and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
(5)  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(6)  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this article and such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

(9)  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(10)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(f)  For a violation of this article: 
(1)  First violation: 
a.  For all sections except sections 5-3(5)(1) through (3), a law enforcement officer shall issue a written warning for a first offense; 
b.  For sections 5-3(5)(1) through (3), a law enforcement officer may issue a warning that a violation exists or may issue a citation with a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fine, a summons, or a notice to appear in county court. 
(2)  Second violation: Within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the first violation, a law enforcement officer may issue a citation with a one hundred dollar ($100.00) fine, a summons, or issue a notice to appear in county court, or effectuate an arrest subject to the penalties of a second degree misdemeanor, as provided in F.S. section 775.082. 
(3)  Third or subsequent violation: Within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the second violation, a law enforcement officer may issue a citation with a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fine, effectuate an arrest, issue a citation a summons or a notice to appear in county court subject to the penalties of a second degree misdemeanor, as provided in F.S. section 775.082. 
(4)  One (1) or more citations may be issued on the same day if a violation continues to exist after the time period for coming into compliance, if any. 
(g)  A citation issued under any section of this article shall be contested in county court. 
(h)  If the violator elects to contest the citation, he or she shall request a hearing through the procedure described on the citation and within the time frame specified on the citation. 
(i)  If the violator neither pays the civil penalty nor contests the citation within the time frame specified on the citation, he or she shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the citation and it shall be deemed an admission to the violation. A judgment may be entered against that person for the maximum civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus applicable fees and costs. 
(j)  In accordance with F.S. chapter 162, and as amended, any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a law enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. section 775.082 or 775.083.

The city commission shall then retain a qualified, independent auditor and he or she shall determine whether the fee is appropriate. The city may require as a condition of the right to such an audit, that the property owner pay for the cost of the audit and deposit with the city a sum equal to the reasonable estimated cost of the audit.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL GOVERNMENT, POLICE, PARKS AND RECREATION, AND ROAD IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 7-70. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The city commission has determined and recognized that the growth rate which the city is experiencing will necessitate extensive facilities improvements and make it necessary to regulate new development in order to maintain general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities at an acceptable level of service so as to maintain quality of life in the city. In order to finance the necessary new capital improvements and to purchase necessary equipment, several combined financing methods will be necessary, one (1) of which will require new developments to pay a general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway impact fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities. 
(b)  Providing general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities is a recognized proprietary power of the city through F.S. § 166.021, and is in the best interests of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway impact fee that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities created by the new land development activity is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the comprehensive plan, as amended, and is in the best interest of the public's health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  The purpose of this article is to continue to enable the city to allow new development in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan and to regulate new development activity generating general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway activities so as to require it to share in the burdens of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities improvements, taking into account and implementing credits based on other future revenue contributions that would assist in funding the improvements. Thus, new growth will help pay for itself, and the existing residents of the city will not have the full financial burden of providing increased general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway capacity at the outset. 
(e)  It is the purpose of this article to establish a system to assist in providing increased capacity for the general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway operations to accommodate the increased demand new development will have on the existing operations. New land development activity will be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of new general government, police, parks and recreation, and roadway facilities and other facilities than its presence necessitates. 
(Ord. No. 06-886, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 06-902, § 2, 10-16-06) 
Sec. 7-71. - Assessment of new projects. 
    All new development and development projects, as those terms are defined herein, shall be subject to the impact fees provided for in this article. 
(Ord. No. 06-886, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 06-902, § 2, 10-16-06) 
Sec. 7-72. - Assessment of change of use, modification or expansion of existing use, reconstruction and mixed use projects. 
(a)  In the case of change of use, modification or expansion of an existing use, or reconstruction, any of which requires the issuance of a building permit, impact fees shall be based on the net positive increase of the impact from the new use as compared to the previous use. 
(b)  If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, the impact fee shall be calculated by apportioning the space specified for each use. 
(Ord. No. 06-886, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 06-902, § 2, 10-16-06) 
Sec. 7-73. - Assessment of comparable uses. 
    If the type of development for which a building permit is sought is not specified on the impact fee schedule set forth in this article, the impact fee assessed shall be the impact fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of use included on the impact fee schedule, as solely determined by the city. The city's determination of comparable use may be contested pursuant to the audit and appeal procedures set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 06-886, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 06-902, § 2, 10-16-06)

Should the hearing be continued at the request of or for the convenience of the appellant, or any other person with party status, any additional cost to the city, including cost of readvertising or other notice, shall be paid by the appellant or other party requesting the continuance, prior to the commencement of the continued hearing. All costs to the city for the hearing and advertising thereof, must be paid prior to the day of the scheduled hearing. If not paid, the city council may postpone the hearing pending receipt of the funds due the city. Only one (1) such continuance shall be authorized any appellant requesting a hearing under this section. If a hearing has been continued once and the fees owed the city are still not paid prior to the continuance date, the appellant shall be deemed to have withdrawn the application for a hearing before the city council and the appealed order shall be deemed final.

(b)  The city shall record a notice of lien in the public records of the county, florida, showing the nature of the lien, the amount thereof and an accurate legal description of the property, including the street address. The lien shall date from the date of recording and recite the names of all persons notified or interested parties. Such municipal lien shall bear interest from the date of recording at the rate of nine (9) percent per year and shall be enforceable by foreclosure in the same manner and time as a city code enforcement lien if unsatisfied after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of recording the notice of lien. 
(c)  Such lien may be foreclosed and collected in the manner and procedure by which real property mortgages are foreclosed and collected, including an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs for recording the notice of lien and prosecuting the foreclosure proceedings. All recorded liens shall be included in a county tax deed sale and no such deed shall be issued unless full payment of principal and interest is received. Upon notice of an impending county tax deed sale, the tax collector shall request the clerk of the circuit court to collect all moneys due the city.

(Ord. No. 456, § 1 (1), 7-1-91) 
Sec. 7-217. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  This article shall be known and referred to as the "Palmetto Landscape Ordinance." The requirements established herein are deemed necessary to encourage comprehensive and efficient landscape site design by integrating elements of existing vegetation, native forest areas, existing topography, and stormwater management systems, thereby enhancing the city's environmental and economic quality, and thereby promoting the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  The purpose is to establish minimum landscaping standards and criteria to preserve vegetative communities, forests and wildlife habitats from adverse impacts of growth while contributing to the process of air purification, recharging groundwater, and the retarding of erosion by stormwater; to promote the conservation of both potable water and nonpotable water by encouraging the preservation of existing native vegetative communities; to promote the planting of natural areas with native vegetation; to promote the use of site-specific plant materials and xeriscape; and to establish requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscape materials. Such requirements will help delineate visual separation of land uses and provide relief from the built-up environment, while improving the value of property. 
(Ord. No. 456, § 1 (2), 7-1-91) 
Sec. 7-218. - Applicability; exemptions.

(c)  Vehicle use area landscaping requirements. All vehicle use areas containing more than six (6) parking stalls or an area greater than one thousand (1,000) square feet shall be landscaped in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  Interior landscaping requirements. For parking stalls that are not abutting perimeter landscaped areas under subsection (b) above, no more than twenty (20) consecutive stalls shall be allowed without a landscape island separating them. All such landscape islands shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width. Islands shall be placed within the interior of the vehicle use area as follows: 
a.  Terminal Islands: A row of parking stalls shall be terminated on each end by a terminal island that shall each contain at least one (1) canopy tree and twenty (20) shrubs. 
b.  Internal Island: The location of internal islands shall be flexible, provided that there are not more than twenty (20) stalls in a row without an island separating such groups of stalls. Such islands shall contain at least one (1) canopy tree and twenty (20) shrubs. 
(2)  Medians. As an alternative to internal islands within abutting rows of parking stalls, a landscaped divider median between such rows shall be provided. The minimum width of such median areas shall be three (3) feet in the event wheel stops are provided or a minimum of eight (8) feet in width in the event concrete curbing is used without wheel stops. Within such divider median, one (1) canopy tree and twenty (20) shrubs shall be planted per fifty (50) linear feet. 
(3)  Perimeter landscaping requirements. Where parking areas abut a street, the requirements of subsection (c)(2) may be utilized to meet perimeter landscaping requirements for the portion of the vehicle use area adjacent to the street. However, where the parking does not abut the street, the perimeter landscaping shall be as follows: A perimeter landscaping island having a minimum width of three (3) feet shall be provided containing one (1) canopy tree per every fifty (50) feet.

(g)  Utilities. No trees shall be placed within any public or private utility easement or access easement within the city. 
(h)  Preservation of existing plant communities. The use of existing vegetation in landscape buffers and areas is preferred, and thus shall be preserved in their entirety to the extent practical, with all trees and ground cover left intact and undisturbed except that prohibited species and controlled species described in section 7-222(a) and (b) shall be removed therefrom. 
(i)  Xeriscape concepts. Xeriscape site development concepts shall be used to promote water conservation. 
(j)  Alternatives. Where the director of public works or the director's designee finds that unique natural features such as topography, vegetation or creative building patterns make strict adherence to these standards unreasonably burdensome or create a hardship, the director of public works or the director's designee may approve an alternative landscape plan, provided that it promotes the intent of the standards contained in this section.

Sec. 7-237. - Building front, side and rear walls abutting streets or public areas. 
(a)  Requirements: 
(1)  All deteriorated or damaged structural and decorative elements visible from a public right-of-way, including signage, shall be repaired or replaced to match as closely as possible the existing or original materials and construction of the building, except that changes shall be permitted that are otherwise required or encouraged under this article. 
(2)  Every such part of a structure visible from a public right-of-way or abutting a street shall be kept structurally sound. Rotten or weakened portions shall be removed, repaired or replaced in such a manner as to be compatible with the rest of the structure or to match the original materials and construction methods. All exposed wood shall be stained or painted. Every such part shall be free of graffiti, litter, dirt, mildew or other debris. Where surfaces are painted, once painted or normally painted, not more than ten (10) percent of such surface may be without paint. Painted surfaces must be maintained without peeling or chalking. 
(3)  Walls shall be repaired and painted to present a neat and clean appearance. Side walls where visible from the street shall be finished or painted in a manner harmonious with the front of the building. 
(4)  Existing miscellaneous nonfunctional elements on the buildings, such as empty electrical conduit, unused sign brackets, etc., shall be removed and the building surface repaired or rebuilt to match adjacent surfaces and original or former condition. Wires and conduit shall be secured and located in an inconspicuous manner. 
(b)  Recommendations: 
(1)  Architectural details, window frames, sashes, door frames and doors should be painted, generally a lighter shade than the wall color, or accented by a vivid color that is harmonious with the wall color. 
(2)  The original appearance is in most cases the most desirable for buildings. Veneers such as metal, wood, brick or stone often hide original and interesting details of an older building. When possible, removal of veneers and the repair, restoration or replacement of the original material (brick, stucco, wood, etc.) is encouraged. 
(Ord. No. 470, § 1, 12-16-91)

Any interior screening, including curtains, drapes and blinds, must be kept in good repair and appearance. Reflective glass is not permitted for any windows, except to the extent expressly recommended herein. 
(b)  Recommendations: 
(1)  Storefront windows are a very important part of creating a rhythm of building openings, as well as offering the pedestrian an inviting view of the display area within the building. The use of clear glass on the first floor will encourage visibility. 
(2)  Slightly tinted or "filmed" glass with a minimum of fifty (50) percent light transmission may be used above the first story. 
(3)  Storefront windows should remain the same size as the original openings. Remodeled windows should be as large as possible and allow room for a bulkhead at the ground level. Original transom heights should be maintained. Windows having aluminum trim, mullions or muntins not consistent or compatible with the overall facade design should be replaced or the trim painted. 
(4)  Display windows and platforms, entrance areas, signs, transoms, lighting, sun protection, awnings, porches, security grills, and other exterior features should be compatible and harmonious with the original scale and character of the structure. All display window elements should utilize their original dimension.

(3)  Awnings that are torn, badly faded or structurally compromised shall be repaired or replaced. 
(b)  Recommendations: 
(1)  Awnings are among the most important features in the total appearance of a building; the location, size and color must be carefully chosen. 
(2)  For the first floor awnings, the highest point should not be higher than the midpoint between the storefront windows and the second-story window sills. They should not cover or unreasonably interfere with any original architectural features of the building. 
(3)  The color and design of the awning should be compatible with the color and design of the building. It is recommended that the name of the store be placed within the valance area of the awning.

The approval, denial or approval subject to terms, conditions, limitations or restrictions, for such docks or dock related structures located on or adjacent to manmade canals greater than forty (40) feet in width or length within the city shall be based upon the following factors, as applicable. For purposes of this section, the term "dock" shall include dock, dock related structures, and floating structures: 
(1)  Zoning requirements. Applications for a dock shall only be processed when the dock is associated with one (1) of the following: 
a.  Accessory uses to contiguous upland properties. One (1) dock may be permitted and constructed as an accessory use to an existing lawfully permitted principal land use on contiguous upland property. One (1) pair of davits may be constructed on or next to a seawall as an accessory use if they meet the side setback requirements for the property and are designed to function independently of the seawall. 
b.  Use on noncontiguous platted water lots. One (1) dock may be permitted and constructed on a noncontiguous water lot, as that term is defined appendix B, article III of this Code. 
c.  Commercial marina. A dock may be permitted and constructed if it is part of a commercial marina approved by all required outside agencies. A copy of permits or approvals issued by all such agencies shall be submitted to the building official. 
d.  Planned developments. Docks and dock related structures may be permitted and constructed as an accessory use to a planned residential development which has common area amenities if proposed by an incorporated association and approved by all required outside agencies. A copy of permits or approvals issued by all such agencies shall be submitted to the building official. 
(2)  Development standards. Applications for docks shall be permitted when such applications comply with the following requirements: 
a.  Side setbacks. Side setbacks for docks and dock related structures shall be measured from the riparian lines of platted waterfront lots or parcels, or from the actual lot lines in those cases where side lot lines actually extend out into the waterway. Such setbacks for docks or dock related structures shall be the same as those required within the zoning district in which abutting upland property is located.

(Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2, 3-3-14) 
Sec. 14-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2, 3-3-14) 
Sec. 14-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

Sec. 14-5. - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.

NOTICE OF NUISANCE 
Date: _______ 
Name of Owner _______ 
Address of Owner _______ 
Our records indicate that you are the owner(s) of the following property in the City of Palmetto, Manatee County, Florida: 
(Description of property) 
An inspection of this property discloses, and I have found and determined, that a nuisance exists thereon so as to constitute a violation of the City of Palmetto Nuisance Law (Chapter 16, Article II of the City of Palmetto Code of Ordinances) by virtue of the following condition or activity: 
[Description of condition which places the property in violation] 
You are hereby notified that you must remedy the above described condition so as to bring it into compliance with the City of Palmetto Code of Ordinances or request a hearing pursuant to the City of Palmetto Code of Ordinances, section 16-30, within twenty (20) days, or such other time as directed by the director of public works or the director's designee, from the date hereof. Failure to remedy the nuisance or request a hearing within the specified time period will be deemed a waiver of your right to a hearing and the city will proceed to remedy this condition. The cost of the work, including abatement and/or removal costs, noticing costs and other expenses, will be imposed as a lien on the property if said costs are not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of billing by the city clerk. 
The City estimates the total cost of abatement and/or removal to be approximately $_______/_______/_______, but in no way represents or guarantees that actual costs will not exceed this amount.

[address and phone number] 
(c)  If the director of public works, or the director's designee, finds and determines that a nuisance exists which presents an immediate danger or threat to the health or life of an individual or the public, he or she shall provide the record owner or owners of the property on which the nuisance exists with written notice personally served upon the owner or owners of the property or upon an occupant of the property that is fifteen (15) years of age or older, and demand the condition to be immediately remedied. The director of public works, or the director's designee, shall post notice upon the front door of the subject property, if applicable. If the condition or activity constituting a nuisance which presents an immediate danger or threat to the health or life of an individual or the public is not remedied within twenty-four (24) hours of the provision of notice hereunder, or within such other time period deemed reasonable by the director of public works, or the director's designee, the director of public works, or the director's designee, may cause the condition or activity to be remedied by the city at the expense of the property owner. 
(d)  If the director of public works, or the director's designee, is unable to locate within twenty-four (24) hours the owner or owners of the property upon which there exists a nuisance which presents an immediate danger or threat to the health or life of an individual or the public, the director of public works, or the director's designee, may cause the condition or activity to be remedied by the city at the expense of the property owner, and provide the property owner with notice thereof subsequent to such action. The failure of the director of public works or his designee to provide prior or subsequent notice to a property owner, after reasonable efforts to locate such owner have been unsuccessful, shall not cause remedial action taken pursuant to this subsection to be invalid or unlawful. 
(e)  Upon issuance of a notice that a nuisance exists which presents an immediate danger or threat to the health or life of an individual or the public, it shall be unlawful for any person to occupy the subject property until such nuisance has been remedied, or upon prior written permission by the director of public works, or the director's designee, for specific, limited purposes including but not limited to securing the premises, performing work to remedy the nuisance, and removal of animals or personal effects. Persons violating this section shall be subject to arrest in accordance with F.S. ch. 901. 
(f)  If the cost of abating the nuisance, and the subsequent filing of a city lien in accordance with section 16-31, would act to severely and drastically diminish the interest of a lien holder on the property, the city shall notify, in the same manner as the owner of the property, the lien holders whose interest in the property is properly recorded with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(Ord. No. 2016-05, § 2, 4-4-16) 
Sec. 16-30. - Hearing. 
(a)  The provisions of this article shall be enforced by referral to a special magistrate as provided for in chapter 2, article IV of this Code. Special magistrates shall have the authority to hear and decide nuisance abatement issues. 
(b)  Within such time period as indicated in the provision of notice to abate, as required by sections 16-28 and 16-29 herein, the owner of the property may make written request to the city clerk for a hearing before a special magistrate, on a form provided by the city, to show that the condition or activity alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition or activity does not constitute a nuisance. At the hearing, the director of public works, or the director's designee, and the property owner may introduce such evidence as is deemed necessary. The property owner shall have the right to be represented by counsel. The hearing shall be open to the public and shall be conducted in accordance with the established rules and regulations for the special magistrates. 
(Ord. No. 2016-05, § 2, 4-4-16; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 3(Exh. B), 2-26-18) 
Sec. 16-31. - Abatement by city; expenses; lien. 
(a)  If a hearing has not been requested within the timeframes set forth in sections 16-28 and 16-29 herein, and the condition or activity described in the notice has not been remedied, the director of public works, or the director's designee, shall cause the condition or activity to be remedied by the city at the expense of the property owner. If the hearing has been held and concluded adversely to the property owner, the director of public works, or the director's designee, shall cause the condition or activity to be remedied by the city at the expense of the property owner, unless the nuisance abatement board in its order has otherwise directed. 
(b)  After causing the condition or activity to be remedied, the director of public works, or the director's designee, shall certify to the city clerk the expense incurred in remedying the condition or activity and shall include a copy of the notice above described, and a copy of the decision of the nuisance abatement board, if any, whereupon such expense shall become payable within thirty (30) days after the date of such certification, after which a lien and charge will be made upon the property, which shall be payable with interest from the date of such certification until paid. 
(c)  Upon receipt of the certification of expense, the city clerk shall notify the record owner or owners of the property in writing of the amount of such expense. The notice shall be given in like manner as provided in section 16-29, except that if the notice is returned by postal authorities, no further mailed notice shall be required. Such notice shall advise the owner or owners of the amount of expense, the date of certification to the city clerk, the date by which the expense is due and payable, and a statement that the expense shall become a lien after said date. The date by which the expense shall be due and payable shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the date of the mailing of such notice. The property owner may, at any time prior to the date on which the expense becomes a lien, make written request to the city clerk for a hearing before the nuisance abatement board to contest the amount of the expense. Upon filing of such request, the expense shall not become a lien until a final decision is made by the nuisance abatement board. 
    The hearing on the amount of the expense shall be conducted substantially as provided for in section 16-30. At the hearing, the property owner and the director of public works may present evidence only as to the reasonableness of the expense amount under the circumstances. Provided, however, that if the expense resulted from the city performing abatement measures pursuant to subsection 16-29(d) of this division, the parties also may present evidence showing that the condition or activity alleged in the notice did or did not exist, or that such condition or activity did or did not constitute a nuisance. Following review by the nuisance abatement board, the owner shall have exhausted his administrative remedies. The nuisance abatement board shall enter a written order either affirming the certified expenses or reducing them, or, where city action was taken pursuant to subsection 16-29(d) and no violation is found to have occurred, declaring that there is no basis for imposition of expenses. Upon entry of such order, the amount of charges approved therein shall become a lien and bear interest as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Administrative costs and applicable attorney's fees for abating the nuisance shall be included in the total cost for abating the nuisance and such total costs shall comprise the lien which may be imposed upon the property by action of this division. 
(d)  All liens created by action of this division shall be a first lien equal to a lien for nonpayment of property taxes, on any property against which an assessment for costs to abate the nuisance has been filed, and shall continue in full force from the date of recording until discharged by satisfaction. The lien shall be enforceable in the same manner as a special assessment lien in favor of the city as provided in F.S. ch. 173, and may be satisfied at any time by payment thereof, including accrued interest. Notice of the lien shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court and recorded among the public records of Manatee County within five (5) days of the charges under this section becoming a lien. Upon payment of the lien, including accrued interest, the city clerk shall, by appropriate means, evidence the satisfaction and cancellation of the lien upon the record thereof.

Sec. 16-32. - Notification of owner and other interested parties upon removal of property by city; disposition of items removed. 
(a)  Notice. Upon taking possession of the nuisance, if an object or thing, the director of public works or the director's designee shall furnish notice in accordance with this section by regular mail to the owner of the property upon which such nuisance was located and to the owner of the object or thing, if known to be different, at the last known address, within ten (10) days of the date when possession of the object or thing was taken. 
(b)  Notice by publication. If there is inability to identify the current owner of the object or thing constituting nuisance, it shall be sufficient notice under this section to publish the notice described above once in a publication as provided by F.S. § 50.011. Such notice by publication may include multiple listings of objects and things. 
(c)  Disposition. After exhaustion of any appeals pursuant to this article, the city may dispose of any personal property in the same manner as city property.

Secs. 17-29-17-46. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - ATTAINABLE HOUSING 

Sec. 17-47. - Policy and intent. 
(a)  Attainable housing problem. The city faces a serious housing problem that threatens its economic security. Lack of attainable housing has a direct impact upon the health, safety, and welfare of city residents. The city will not be able to maintain a healthy environment without additional housing affordable to households earning between eighty (80) percent and one hundred twenty (120) percent of the median income. By adoption of this article, the city intends the following: 
(1)  To encourage development and availability of housing units within the city that are soundly constructed, aesthetically pleasing, and affordable to a broad range of households with varying income levels; 
(2)  To promote the city's goal of achieving a specific number of housing units within the city that are affordable to households earning between eighty (80) percent and one hundred twenty (120) percent of the median income; 
(3)  To achieve a balanced housing market that provides adequate housing for public and private sector employees that will be needed to meet service demand resulting from the development of market-rate housing within the city; 
(4)  To expand the array of housing opportunities within the city such that employees may live in the region where they work, thereby reducing, among other things, traffic, related air quality impacts, and demands placed on the city's infrastructure. 
(b)  Compliance and presumption of public benefit. Consistent with the city's intent and policy behind enacting this article, the city hereby determines that those who construct attainable housing units pursuant to this article shall be afforded a presumption that their efforts to construct such housing and the benefits they may receive pursuant to this article are in the best interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the city. The city further declares that it shall fully cooperate with those who construct attainable housing units pursuant to this article to provide to such developers as many incentives and benefits as possible. Any benefits and incentives denied to developers who construct attainable housing units pursuant to this article shall be accompanied by findings of fact which clearly support the denial. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-48. - Definitions. 
    The following terms shall have the following meanings within this article, except where context would otherwise require: 
    Affordable housing unit or affordable unit means a residential unit that must be affordable for purchase by eligible households earning less than eighty (80) percent of the median household income. Sales prices for affordable housing units may be determined by the county department and shall be approved by the city commission. 
    Attainable housing unit or workforce unit means a residential unit within the city that an eligible household may purchase as their homestead at or below the maximum attainable housing unit sales price, but above the maximum sales price for an affordable housing unit. 
    Baseline means the number of attainable housing units a developer is required to construct pursuant to section 17-51. During a "voluntary period," as defined in section 17-49, the baseline means the number of attainable housing units a developer would be required to construct pursuant to section 17-51, were that provision in effect and applicable at that time. 
    Certificate of credit is a certificate issued by the office of the city planner. Such certificate indicates that a developer has constructed attainable housing unit(s) during a "voluntary period," as defined in section 17-49, or has constructed attainable housing unit(s) above the baseline during a "mandatory period," as defined therein. 
    City planner means the city planner for the City of Palmetto and shall include his or her designee. 
    Construct or construction , as it pertains to the building of attainable housing units, means to build an attainable housing unit and be issued a certificate of occupancy for that unit, or in instances where the developer may make a "payment in lieu" pursuant to section 17-54 for an attainable housing unit, means to remit all funds or make all donations to the city in accordance with such section. "Construct" or "construction" shall only apply to new attainable housing units built after the effective date of this article and to the renovation of units built before the effective date of this article, where such renovation increases the market value of the unit by fifty-one (51) percent or more. 
    County department means the Manatee County Housing Authority, so long as its responsible for administering the workforce housing program provisions of Manatee County's Land Development Code, chapter 13. 
    Credit means the measurement by which individual attainable housing units are represented in a certificate of credit. A certificate of credit may represent one (1) credit, a part of a credit, or several credits. 
    Developer means any person, business, or other legal entity that seeks approval from the city to construct residential units. 
    Eligible household means a household determined by the county department to earn not less than eighty (80) percent nor more than one hundred twenty (120) percent of the median household income, and not exceed a corresponding maximum asset level. 
    Housing trust fund means a trust fund maintained by the city commission to hold any payments made by developers as provided for in this article. The funds shall be used only to subsidize the purchase of a home by an eligible household or to facilitate the development of additional attainable housing units. 
    Maximum attainable housing unit sales price means the maximum sales price for a home that an eligible household can afford. The maximum attainable housing unit sales price may be determined by the county department and shall be approved by the city commission. The price shall include the total cost of the purchase of the home and shall include any additional amenities that may be offered by the seller, such as parking spaces and community facility usage, with the purchase of the home. 
    Median household income means the median income of a household within the Manatee County metropolitan area. The median household income may be determined by the county department and shall be approved by the city commission. 
    Unit means a room or group of rooms forming a single independent habitable area used for, or intended to be used for living, sleeping, sanitation, cooking, and eating purposes by one (1) family only; and made available to such family for purchase. Unless the context requires otherwise, a "unit" does not include attainable housing units, affordable units, nursing homes, assisted care living facilities, retirement homes, school dormitories, mobile homes, and apartments. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-49. - Applicability of mandatory provisions. 
    Section 17-51 of this article shall apply only during such times when the number of attainable housing units falls below fifteen (15) percent of the total number of residential units constructed or expected to be constructed within the city after the effective date of this article and by the next determination date set forth below in subsection (b) ("total residential units"). This shall be referred to as a "mandatory period." Those times when the number of attainable housing units meets or exceeds fifteen (15) percent of the total residential units shall be referred to as a "voluntary period." 
(1)  The city planner shall initially determine the number of total residential units by utilizing reliable data to estimate the number of residential units expected to be constructed in the city from the effective date of this article to January 1, 2010. 
(2)  Beginning on January 1, 2010, and on January 1 every five (5) years thereafter ("determination date"), the city planner shall update the number of total residential units by utilizing reliable data to estimate the number of residential units constructed as of the effective date of this article and expected to be constructed in the city by a date that is five (5) years from the date of the prior determination. 
(3)  In determining whether the required percentage of attainable housing units exists, the city planner may include, in his or her sole discretion and pursuant to an adopted administrative policy, those attainable housing units which have been sufficiently guaranteed, in writing, to be constructed before the next determination date set forth in subsections (1) and (2), above. The city planner shall be authorized, pursuant to an adopted administrative policy, to withhold declaring a voluntary period until all or some portion of the attainable housing units that have been sufficiently guaranteed are constructed. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-50. - Voluntary period. 
    Developers who voluntarily construct attainable housing units during a voluntary period shall be eligible for developer incentives as set forth in section 17-52, provided that the developer constructs a number of attainable housing units equivalent to or above the baseline, and shall be eligible for developer certificates of credit as set forth in section 17-53. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-51. - Attainable housing unit requirements (mandatory period). 
(a)  Applicable developments. The provisions of this section may apply to developers who intend to and ultimately do construct attainable housing unit(s) and who voluntarily subject themselves to this article by execution of a written agreement with the city, and shall apply to all developers seeking subdivision approval or other approvals requiring site plan review in connection with new construction: 
(1)  Of ten (10) units or more; 
(2)  Of five (5) units or more, but less than ten (10) units, where the total estimated project value is at least one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00), or eight (8) times the maximum attainable housing unit sales price, whichever is greater; or 
(3)  Of five (5) units or more, but less than (10) units, where the total project area, excluding designated wetlands and mandatory conservation areas, is ten (10) acres or more. 
(b)  Avoidance prohibited. Developments shall not be segmented or phased in a manner to avoid compliance with these provisions. 
(c)  Number of attainable housing units required. Developers to which this section applies shall provide a minimum of fifteen percent (fifteen (15) percent) of the total number of approved units (rounding up where necessary to result in a whole number of units) for the construction of attainable housing units. The minimum number of attainable housing units shall be referred to as the "baseline." 
(d)  Location and quality. Developers shall provide attainable housing units either on the site of the proposed development or off-site within the city limits. The character and quality of attainable housing units must be consistent with established guidelines kept on file in the building department. All guidelines shall further the policy and intent of this article, including, but not limited to, the policy that the location of off-site attainable housing units shall be in areas which are deemed by the city commission to be appropriate and beneficial to the public. 
(e)  On-site development plans. Where required attainable housing units will be constructed on-site, developers shall simultaneously submit plans for both the attainable and non-attainable housing units to the city planner. 
(f)  Off-site development plans. Where some or all of the required attainable housing units will be constructed off-site, developers shall not be required to simultaneously submit plans for attainable housing units, but shall not receive a certificate of occupancy for non-attainable housing units until all off-site required attainable housing units have received a certificate of occupancy or until the city planner has been provided with a sufficient written guarantee, as determined by the city commission, that the off-site required attainable housing units will be constructed at a location deemed by the city commission to be appropriate and beneficial to the public within two (2) years of the execution of such guarantee, unless such time limit is modified by approval of the city commission. 
(g)  Developer incentives. Developers who provide the requisite number of attainable housing units under this section shall be entitled to request incentives pursuant to section 17-52. 
(h)  Waivers and payments-in-lieu. Developers for whom the provisions of this section impose demonstrable burdens, as outlined in section 17-56(b), may apply for waivers and request approval to make payments in lieu of constructing all or some of the attainable housing units required herein, as provided for in section 17-54 of this division. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-52. - Developer incentives. 
(a)  Request for incentives required. At the development approval application stage, a developer who intends to construct attainable housing units and desires to receive incentives pursuant to this article must notify the city planner on a form provided by the city planner to be entitled "request for incentives." The form shall include: 
(1)  A list of incentives potentially available to the developer, including, but not limited to, an increase in density over what is otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the development is located, waivers and modifications to setbacks, parking, and amenity requirements, and development fee reductions; and 
(2)  A description of any other benefits or incentives the developer seeks which would assist in making the construction of attainable housing units more feasible and economically justifiable for the developer; and 
(3)  A narrative describing how the design and orientation of the overall development minimizes any negative impacts of applying the proposed incentives and maintains compatibility with the surrounding land uses. The narrative shall address any matter concerning such impact on the surrounding neighborhood and the city as a whole, including but not limited to the following: 
a.  Does applying the proposed incentives conform in all respects to the current zoning code? 
b.  Does applying the proposed incentives conform to the current comprehensive plan? 
c.  Does applying the proposed incentives conflict with or place an inordinate burden on existing or planned public infrastructure and services such as the provision of water and sewer services, refuse management, emergency services, and similar necessary services? 
d.  Will applying the proposed incentives adversely affect vehicular or pedestrian traffic patterns or congestion? 
e.  Will the proposed change adversely impact population density or development intensity such that the demand for schools, recreational areas and facilities, and other public facilities are adversely affected? 
f.  Will the proposed change otherwise adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood or the city as a whole? 
g.  Is applying the proposed incentives consistent with the development patterns in the area and appropriate for orderly development of the community? 
h.  Will the proposed change adversely impact historic resources? 
i.  Will the proposed change have an adverse environmental impact on the vicinity? 
(b)  Completeness review by city. Within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request for incentives, the city planner shall review the request for completeness. 
(1)  If all required information is included within the request, the city planner shall consider the request for incentives complete and provide the petitioner with written notification of such. 
(2)  If additional information is required, the city planner shall notify the petitioner in writing, by hand-delivery or by certified mail, return-receipt requested, of any additional information that the city planner must receive before it can deem the application complete. The request for incentives shall be considered withdrawn if all required information is not provided within sixty (60) business days of receipt of notification provided for under this section. 
(3)  Nothing herein shall prevent the petitioner from amending the request for incentives with supplemental information, or prevent the city planner from requiring supplemental information, at any time after the request is deemed complete and while the request is being reviewed; however, whether such additional information will be considered is at the discretion of the city planner. 
(c)  Review by city planner. Within forty-five (45) business days of the determination that the request for incentives is complete, the city planner shall review the request and determine in writing which incentives are recommended to be applied to the development. All other development applications pertaining to the subject property shall be deemed incomplete, and the time normally afforded to review such applications shall be tolled, until the city planner makes the written recommendation on the request. The city planner shall provide in the written recommendation, where possible, conditional recommendations for incentives not otherwise recommended for approval. City staff shall work with developers to award incentives that make the construction of attainable housing units economically viable. Toward that end, the city planner shall have the authority to waive administrative requirements promulgated by the mayor or city departments and imposed on developments by the city, so long as such waiver does not conflict with the city's comprehensive plan or Charter, or with preemptive state and federal laws. Any waiver made pursuant to this subsection shall be uniformly applied amongst similarly situated developments, as determined at the sole discretion of the city planner. 
(d)  Agreement required. All awarded incentives shall be memorialized in an agreement between the city and the developer. Where applicable, the incentives also shall be included in the final development order. 
(e)  Review by city commission. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the city commission shall hold a properly noticed public hearing regarding all requests to apply developer incentives. Proper notification shall be consistent with the requirements of the city zoning code pertaining to variances. Subsequent to the public hearing at which the request for development approval is considered, the city commission shall make specific findings and determinations as set forth herein. The commission shall deny application of requested incentives only if it finds that applying the incentives is incompatible with surrounding development and infrastructure, that such application would contravene the intent of this article, or that application of the requested incentives is otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. The commission shall have the authority to approve an application of such incentives with conditions, or approve an application of such incentives that is less than that requested by the applicant. 
(f)  Incentives for on-site construction. It is the intent of this article to promote mixed developments of both attainable and non-attainable housing units. Accordingly, the city commission shall have the authority to award additional incentives where attainable housing units will be constructed on-site. 
(g)  Time limit. All incentives, benefits, and credits awarded pursuant to this section 17-52 and section 17-53 must be applied to a development within three (3) years of construction of the attainable housing units that gave rise to the request for such incentives and benefits and to the issuance of such credits. A developer may receive an extension on such time limit for a maximum of two (2) years, provided that the city commission finds that an extension is necessary and consistent with the intent and purposes of this article, and provided that the city commission authorizes such requested extension or an extension of less time than requested. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 07-932, § 2, 6-4-07) 
Sec. 17-53. - Certificates of credit. 
(a)  Receiving. Developers who construct attainable housing units above the baseline during a mandatory period shall receive a certificate of credit representing the number of attainable housing units constructed above the baseline. Developers who voluntarily construct attainable housing units during a voluntary period shall receive a certificate of credit representing the number of all attainable housing units constructed. The city planner shall issue these certificates to the developer upon the completion of construction and issuance of a certificate of occupancy for these attainable housing units. Such certificate must contain: 
(1)  A unique reference number; 
(2)  The name(s) of the developer(s); 
(3)  The name of the subject development; 
(4)  Information concerning what the certificate represents; 
(5)  The number of credits; 
(6)  Whether the certificate was granted for the construction of attainable housing units during a mandatory or voluntary period; 
(7)  The number of years for which the certificate is valid; and 
(8)  Instructions on how to validly transfer the certificate. 
As it pertains to determining the number of attainable housing units constructed and the number of credits to be issued under this subsection, the city planner shall not take into account redeemed certificates of credit. 
(b)  Redeeming. The holder of a certificate of credit may present such certificate to the city planner during the development approval application stage with a request to redeem the certificate. The holder of the certificate may request to redeem the certificate for the total number stated thereon or a number less than the total number stated thereon. A redeemed certificate is equivalent to the developer having constructed an attainable housing unit or Units within the development for which the developer has applied for approval. The redeemed certificate shall decrease the total number of attainable housing units the developer must construct in order to reach the baseline and receive the incentives set forth in this article, by one (1) for each one (1) credit the developer redeems from his certificate. If the holder of a certificate does not redeem the total number of attainable housing units represented by a certificate, the remainder of such number, not then redeemed, shall be issued by new certificate to the holder of the original certificate; provided, however, that all credits still must be redeemed by the expiration date provided on the original certificate. 
(c)  Transferring. The holder of a certificate of credit may transfer the certificate, provided that the holder surrenders it, properly endorsed, to the city planner. The city planner shall then issue a new certificate to the party to whom the holder of the certificate instructs the same to be transferred, and the city planner shall record such transfer on the records of the city. If the holder of a certificate does not transfer the total number of attainable housing units represented by a certificate, the remainder of such number, not then transferred, shall be issued by new certificate to the transferor. 
(d)  Voluntary period. Certificates of credit received for the construction of attainable housing units during a voluntary period must be redeemed within ten (10) years from the date of issue and are not subject to time limitations otherwise imposed on certificates of credit granted for the construction of attainable housing units during a mandatory period. A developer who applies for incentives based on the redemption of a certificate of credit, received during a voluntary period, but who is not granted the incentives applied for, may withdraw the use of the certificate. In such circumstances, the city planner shall return the certificate to the developer and no longer consider the certificate redeemed. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06) 
Sec. 17-54. - Payment in lieu. 
    A developer may make a payment into the housing trust fund in lieu of constructing a required attainable housing unit, provided that the city commission finds: 
(1)  That a waiver of the requirements of this article to build the attainable housing unit is appropriate in accordance with subsection 17-56(b) herein; or 
(2)  That the payment offered by the developer will assist substantially in increasing the future provision of attainable housing units by other developers. These payments shall be by cash or by equivalently valued contributions, as determined solely by the city commission. A payment shall be made for every required attainable housing unit not provided by the developer. For each unit required, the amount of the payment shall be at least twenty (20) percent of the then-current maximum attainable housing unit sales price. The amount paid to the trust fund shall be used only to subsidize the purchase of a home by an eligible household or to facilitate the development of additional attainable housing units. 
(Ord. No. 06-892, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 07-932, § 3, 6-4-07) 
Sec. 17-55. - Vested rights. 
(a)  Vested properties. Those provisions set out in this article requiring of new development the provision of attainable housing units or in-lieu of payments shall not apply to the development of any property authorized by and consistent with any of the following development orders approved on or before July 31, 2006: preliminary plat approval; site plan approval; conceptual plan approval; general development plan approval; development agreement, approved pursuant to Florida Statutes; or DRI development order approval. 
(b)  Effect of major modification. In those instances where the property owner of vested property applies for a new development order, that if approved, would constitute a major modification of the previous development order, that property shall lose its vested status as it relates to the provisions of this article upon approval.

(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 5, 5-7-18) 
Sec. 18-8. - Evidence. 
    A vehicle shall be in violation of this section if it is in a state of evident disuse, neglect, or abandonment to be an abandoned motor vehicle or vessel as set forth in section 18-1 above. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, factors such as the vehicle or vessel being wrecked or inoperative; vegetative growth underneath the vehicle or vessel as high as the vehicle or vessel body or frame; refuse or debris collected underneath, on top, or about the vehicle or vessel; the vehicle or vessel is used primarily for storage purposes; partially dismantled vehicles or vessel, vehicles or vessels having no engine, transmission, or other major and visible parts dismantled or missing; or a vehicle or vessel being in any physical state rendering it inoperative. If the primary apparent evidence of neglect or abandonment is vegetation growing under the vehicle or vessel, then the officer shall, using his or her training and experience, determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the vehicle or vessel is in a state of evident disuse, neglect or abandonment pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. In addition, the absence of a valid license plate or sticker for the current year and/or the absence of a current motor vehicle or vessel registration certificate shall be prima facie evidence that such vehicle or vessel is abandoned, junked, or discarded; however, the presence of any such item shall not in and of itself mean that such vehicle or vessel is abandoned or derelict. The mere absence of a current motor vehicle or vessel registration, license plate, or sticker may be refuted by the property owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or vehicle or vessel owner upon proof that the vehicle or vessel is immediately drive-able and is missing no major mechanical component(s). 
    Based upon the totality of the above evidence, an abandoned motor vehicle or vessel will be considered abandoned, dilapidated, derelict, or neglected and must be removed from the premises unless: 
(1)  The vehicle or vessel is within a completely enclosed building, shed or garage, with no part being visible from a public street; or 
(2)  The vehicle or vessel is upon the premises of an automobile or marine repair or storage building for which the owner of the business has a current city business tax license and zoning approval; or 
(3)  Where said vehicle or vessel is completely enclosed within a fully opaque fence of at least six (6) feet in height and located on the side or rear of private property. 
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 5, 5-7-18) 
Sec. 18-9. - Enforcement and responsibility for disposition for abandoned motor vehicles or vessels. 
    When any abandoned motor vehicle or vessel is determined to be abandoned and/or derelict by the City of Palmetto as set forth in this ordinance, then the person in charge, ownership, or control of the real property where the vehicle or vessel is located, whether as property owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, vehicle or vessel owner, or otherwise, shall remove such vehicle or vessel from the property. If the abandoned motor vehicle or vessel is located on private property, officer shall give a written notice to said person to remove said vehicle within five (5) calendar days from the date of the notice. If the vehicle or vessel is not removed by the end of the five-day period, the officer shall issue a notice of hearing to appear before the City of Palmetto Special Magistrate. The owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, and/or agent of the property upon which a violation of this ordinance occurs and the owner of the motor vehicle or vessel that is located on private property in violation of this article shall be jointly and individually responsible for failure to comply with the provisions of this article.

Sec. 19-202. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Internet/sweepstakes cafe (cafe) means any business or entity that provides one (1) or more simulated gambling devices for use by the public at the business' or entity's licensed business location. The use of simulated gambling devices does not have to be the business' or entity's primary source of business or income. 
    Person means an individual, association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or any other type of organization, whether conducted for profit or not for profit, or a director, executive, officer, manager, or employee of an association, partnership, joint venture, corporation, or other organization.

The following rules of construction apply to this definition of "simulated gambling device": 
(1)  The term "device" means any mechanical or electrical contrivance, computer, terminal, video, or other equipment that may or may not be capable of downloading games from a central server system, machine, computer, or other device or equipment.

(3)  The term "object" means a coin, bill, ticket, token, card, or similar object, obtained directly or indirectly through payment of consideration, or obtained as a bonus or supplement to another transaction involving the payment of consideration. 
(4)  The terms "play or operate" or "play or operation" includes the use of skill, the application of the element of chance, or both. 
(5)  The term "computer simulation" includes simulations by means of a computer, computer system, video display, video system, or any other form of electronic video presentation. 
(6)  The term "game" includes slot machines, poker, bingo, craps, keno, any other type of game ordinarily played in a casino, a drawing, contest or other promotion, lotto, sweepstakes, and any other game associated with gambling or which could be associated with gambling, but the term "game" does not necessarily imply that actual gambling is involved. 
(7)  The term "payoff" means cash, monetary or other credit, billets, tickets, tokens, or electronic credits to be exchanged for cash or to receive merchandise or anything of value whatsoever, whether made automatically from the machine or manually. 
(8)  The use of the word "gambling" in the term "simulated gambling device" is for convenience of reference only. The term "simulated gambling device" as used in this article is defined exclusively by this subsection and does not incorporate or imply any legal definition or requirement applicable to gambling that may be found elsewhere. 
    Slot machine means any electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical device which is adapted for use such that by the insertion of coin(s), token(s), or other method of payment the device will allow an operator to play or operate the machine such that the device displays pictures, icons, or other images which may, depending upon the displayed combination of said pictures, icons, or other images, allow the operator to obtain an item or items of value, including, but not limited to, money, objects, or coupons.

Sec. 19-204. - Intent. 
(a)  The intent of the city commission acting as the governing body of the City of Palmetto, Florida, in adopting this article is to inhibit the unregulated growth of internet/sweepstakes cafes within the City of Palmetto until:

(2)  The Courts of the State of Florida make a determination as to whether simulated gambling devices are "slot machines" as defined in F.S. chapter 849. 
(b)  It is specifically not the intent of the city commission by the adoption of this article to condone or approve the use of simulated gambling devices. 
(Ord. No. 2012-01, § 2, 1-9-12) 
Sec. 19-205. - Temporary moratorium. 
    The city commission finds that the proliferation of Internet/sweepstakes cafes, along with the questionable legality of the simulated gambling devices in use by the cafes, requires regulation and further interpretation of the statues regulating gambling. The interest of the citizens of the City of Palmetto and the State of Florida will be better served if such regulation and statutory interpretation is provided uniformly by the state legislature and the state court system. In an effort to limit the expansion of such questionable business activity until the legislature or courts act, a temporary moratorium is established for the licensing of any new Internet/sweepstakes cafes which are not established and conducting business as of the effective date of this article. This temporary moratorium shall be in place from the effective date of this article through September 30, 2012.

For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions, without the crediting of interest for non-vested members and with interest for members who are vested. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a fulltime general employee, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board.

If a non-vested member should not be reemployed as a general employee within five (5) years, then his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, will be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to roll over the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board.

A member shall be given credit for all periods of employment for which no member contributions were required. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. However, if a terminated employee receives a payment pursuant to subsection 22-89(a), (b) or (c) and is subsequently reemployed by the city, his prior credited service shall be reinstated only if the member repays to the fund the amount of his entire prior distribution, with interest at five (5) percent per annum, compounded annually from date of distribution to date of repayment. 
    A member shall be given a credited service for the entire month in which his employment with the city commences or terminates. A member shall be given credited service during an authorized leave of absence without pay provided the member returns to the employment with the city upon the expiration of such leave and pays the contributions to the fund within sixty (60) days which he would have been paid at his normal rate of salary during his absence. If a member does not return to employment with the city upon the expiration of an authorized leave of absence or make the required payment, he will not be given credited service for the pay period of such leave. 
    In the event that a member of this system has also accumulated credited service in the police officers' retirement system maintained by the city, then such other credited service shall be used in determining vesting as provided for in section 22-89, and for determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such other credited service will not be considered in determining benefits under this system. Only his credited service and salary under this system on or after his date of membership in this system will be considered for benefit calculation. In addition, any benefit calculation for a member of this system who is or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he has become a member of another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based upon the members average final compensation, credited service and benefit accrual rate as of the date the member ceased to be a general employee. 
    The years or parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a general employee to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a general employee within one (1) year following the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The member deposits into the fund the same sum that the member would have contributed, if any, if he had remained a general employee during his absence. The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subdivision shall be five (5) years. The member must deposit all missed contributions within a period equal to three (3) times the period of military service, but not more than five (5) years, following reemployment or he will forfeit the right to receive credited service for his military service pursuant to this paragraph. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means October 1, 1996. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    General employee means any actively employed person in the regular fulltime service of the city, including those in their initial probationary employment period, but not including certified police officers employed by the city. 
    Member means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve (12) month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as general employee reportable on the member's W-2 form including lump sum payments of unused sick leave and vacation time, plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. For service earned after July 1, 2011, salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year and shall also not include payments for accrued unused sick or annual leave. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year or accrued unused sick or annual leave accrued as of July 1, 2011 and attributable to service earned prior to July 1, 2011, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after July 1, 2011. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to July 1, 2011, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on July 1, 2011, or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on July 1, 2011. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount that was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Palmetto general employees' retirement system as contained herein and all amendments thereto. 
    The masculine gender, where used herein, unless the context specifically requires otherwise, shall include both the feminine and masculine genders.

Sec. 22-82. - Membership. 
    Conditions of eligibility. 
(1)  All general employees as of January 1, 1986, all those subsequently becoming members, and all future new general employees shall be members of this system as a condition of employment. 
(2)  If as of January 1, 1986, a general employee elected not to become a member in the system, such member may subsequently elect to become a member of the system. He shall become a member on the date such election is submitted in writing to the board. Credited service shall be given for all periods of employment with the city provided such member pays to the fund an amount which would equal his accumulated contributions, determined as if he had participated in the system from the date he is requesting credit, plus interest at the rate of five (5) percent compounded annually. If such member does not contribute his member contributions to the fund, credited service shall be given from the date he became a member. 
(3)  Opt out option. Notwithstanding subsection (1), the appointed officers as provided in section 2-2 of this Code of Ordinances, who are new employees of the city, may upon employment as an appointed officer, notify the board and the city in writing of his election to not be a member of the system. Current employees of the city who become an appointed officer are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In the event of any such election, that appointed officer shall be barred from future membership in the system. Thereafter, contributions to the plan in accordance with section 22-85 shall not be required, he shall not be eligible to be elected as a member trustee on the board or vote for a member trustee, and he shall not be eligible for any other benefits from the plan. 
(4)  Beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each general employee shall complete a form prescribed by the board providing for a designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries.

Sec. 22-83. - Board of trustees. 
(1)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this article are hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board of trustees is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board of trustees shall consist of seven (7) trustees, two (2) of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the city, who shall be appointed pursuant to the City Charter, section 16, mayor-powers and duties, two (2) of whom shall be members of the system, who shall be elected by a majority of the general employees who are members of the system, one (1) of whom shall be the city clerk, and two (2) of whom shall be chosen by a majority of the previous five (5) trustees as provided for herein, and such persons' names shall be submitted to the Palmetto City Commission. In the event the mayor or a member of city commission is appointed to the board, his duties as trustee shall be deemed ex-officio duties to his duties as mayor or commissioner. The sixth and seventh trustees shall have the same rights as each of the other five (5) trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve two-year terms unless either sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the Palmetto City Commissioner at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a general employee or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. Current trustees who are serving three-year terms shall serve until the completion of the three-year term and may then be reappointed or reelected for two-year terms. DROP participants can be elected as and vote for elected trustees. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(2)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chairman, vice-chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(3)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the board. Four (4) affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest and shall comply with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(4)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. 
(5)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

Sec. 22-84. - Finances and fund management. 
    Establishment and operation of fund. 
(1)  As part of the system, the fund is hereby continued, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system, including the assets of the prior general employees' retirement system. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the general employees' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the finance director of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the finance director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the finance director or clearly identified as such funds of the general employees' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the general employees' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in section 280.02, Florida Statutes, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purpose of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all funds assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(a)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis. 
(b)  Receipts and disbursements. 
(c)  Benefit payments. 
(d)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city. 
(e)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever. 
(f)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund, and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. However, the board shall be permitted to invest only in those investments set forth in F.S. § 215.47 and shall be limited to the investment restrictions provided for therein. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and governmental plans under Section 401(a)(24) of the Internal Revenue Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
i.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection 3. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
ii.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection 3. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
iii.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
c.  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
e.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered but is not required to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction, or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits herein provided for. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 4, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 02-747, § 2, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 09-1002, § 2, 12-7-09; Ord. No. 2013-08, § 3, 8-5-13; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 3, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-85. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board at least monthly. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(c)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 5, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 09-988, § 2, 4-6-09) 
Sec. 22-86. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age sixty (60) and the completion of five (5) years of credited service for those who were members on December 31, 1994, and ten (10) years of credited service for those who become members on or after January 1, 1995, or upon completion of thirty (30) years of credited service, regardless of age. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime and ceasing upon death. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal two and one-half (2.50) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of five (5) years of credited service for those who were members on December 31, 1994 and ten (10) years of credited service for those who become members on or after January 1, 1995. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a general employee and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (a) above, reduced by one-quarter (0.25) percent for each month by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a general employee. 
(3)  If a member defers his pension as provided under this section and dies before his normal retirement date, then his beneficiary will be entitled to a death benefit determined in accordance with preretirement death. 
(e)  Cost of living allowance. Effective October 1, 1996, the monthly benefit currently being received by every retired member, joint pensioner or beneficiary receiving benefits as a result of a retirement occurring prior to December 1, 1990 shall be increased by ten (10) percent; provided further, however, that if the benefit of any current retiree is less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), including the increase, if applicable, the benefit shall be increased to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(f)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 6, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 621, § 1, 10-5-98; Ord. No. 09-988, § 3, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 4, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-87. - Preretirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection 22-90(g).

(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained seventy and one-half (701/2). 
(7)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsections (1) or (2), but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable.

(7)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

(Ord. No. 575, § 7, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 02-747, § 3, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 09-988, § 4, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 5, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-88. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits. Any member with five (5) or more years of credited service for those who were members on December 31, 1994, and ten (10) or more years of credited service for those who become members on or after January 1, 1995, who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment to perform the duties he was assigned at the time of the impairment and unable to perform the duties of another position or job which the city makes available to him in a similar classification and rank and unable to perform other gainful employment with another employer for which the employee is qualified by reason of his training, education or experience, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or alcohol. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a general employee with the City of Palmetto shall have terminated. 
(6)  Willful, wanton or intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the member. 
(7)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(8)  A condition preexisting the general employee's membership in the system. No member shall be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition preexisting at the time of membership in the system, provided that such preexisting condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to said membership. 
(c)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a general employee, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that member had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the general employee recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a general employee, his service shall be deemed to have been continuous, and the period for which member received a disability retirement income shall be credited service for purposes of the system. If the general employee fails to reenter the service of the city as a general employee within thirty (30) days from the date the board determines that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, the member's future benefits shall be determined as though he initially terminated employment on the date the board determined that he was permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he was unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(d)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death. 
    Provided, however, the disabled retiree may select at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 22-90(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(e)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to Florida Statute Chapter 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed one hundred (100) percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed one hundred (100) percent of such salary. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten (10) years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 8, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 621, § 2, 10-5-98; Ord. No. 02-747, § 4, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 09-988, § 5, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 6, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-89. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment with the city, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(a)  If the member has less than five (5) years credited service upon termination, for those who were members on December 31, 1994, or less than ten (10) years of credited service upon termination, for those who became members on or after January 1, 1995, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(b)  For those members who became members on or before October 1, 1996, if the member has five (5) years of credited service upon termination, for those who were members on December 31, 1994, or ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, for those who became members on or after January 1, 1995, the member shall be entitled to either the benefit provided for in subsection (c) below or a lump sum benefit equal to the greater of (1) or (2) where, 
(1)  Is five (5) times the member's accrued annual benefit determined as of his termination date, and 
(2)  Is the actuarially equivalent lump sum value of the member's accrued benefit at his termination date. 
(c)  For those who become members after October 1, 1996, if the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under preretirement death. 
(d)  If a vested terminated person entitled to a benefit under subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this section is subsequently reemployed by the city prior to receipt of such benefit, such benefit shall not be payable and the member shall thereafter be entitled to benefits determined under the applicable provisions of this system, based on credited service earned both before and after the date of reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 9, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 621, § 3, 10-5-98; Ord. No. 02-747, § 5, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 08-968, § 4, 5-19-08; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 7, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-90. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the member for his lifetime only, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security Law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  For members who do not participate in the DROP pursuant to section 22-108, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
b.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump; sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
c.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
d.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change; provided however, if no event may a member change his designated joint pensioner more than twice. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a member's or retiree's beneficiary or joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the board shall adjust the retiree's monthly benefit by application of actuarial calculations to insure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the retiree's then-current benefit. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 22-91. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 22-87. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 22-91. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 22-86, subsection (a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 10, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 02-747, § 6, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 06-891, § 2, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 08-968, § 5, 5-19-08; Ord. No. 09-988, § 6, 4-6-09; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 8, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-91. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceased the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 575, § 11, 11-4-96; Ord. No. 02-747, § 7, 8-5-02) 
Sec. 22-92. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes.

Sec. 22-93. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid.

(Ord. No. 575, § 13, 11-4-96) 
Sec. 22-94. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit . If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five-percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5-percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)); and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect . Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then-applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the Regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the Regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other Adjustments in Limitations . 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in [subsection] (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in [subsection] (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 22-88, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 22-87. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 22-88, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 22-87. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans . The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 22-94, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 22-94 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 22-94 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits . Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits . 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 22-105 and 22-107, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b., the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection, the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a plan year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b).

Editor's note- Ord. No. 02-747, § 8, adopted Aug. 5, 2002, repealed section 22-94 in its entirety, and renumbered former sections 22-95-22-107 as new sections 22-94-22-106. Former section 22-94 pertained to the board attorney and professionals, and derived from Ord. No. 575, § 14, adopted Nov. 4, 1996. 
Sec. 22-95. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection, distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death ofmember before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to sections 22-86, 22-87, 22-89, or 22-90 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 22-87) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 22-87.

Sec. 22-96. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council of the city which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries.

Sec. 22-97. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(c)  The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system as of the date of repeal of this article, or if contributions to the system are discontinued with the date of such discontinuation being determined by the board: 
(1)  Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retiree receiving a retirement or disability benefit hereunder on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a retired or disabled (but since deceased) member, and each member who has, by such date, become eligible for normal retirement but has not yet retired, an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit, provided that, if such asset value be less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
(2)  If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionment under subsection (1), apportionment shall next be made in respect of such member in the service of the city on such date who is vested and who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsection (1), in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, and each vested former member then entitled to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments, in the amount required to provide said actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(3)  If there be any asset value after the apportionments under subsections (1) and (2), apportionment shall be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsections (1) and (2) in the amount equal to member's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder such latter amount shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(4)  If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionments under subsections (1), (2), and (3), apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member included in subsection (3) to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of the nonvested accrued normal retirement benefit, less the amount apportioned in subsection (3), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such amounts shall be reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(5)  In the event that there be asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in subsections (1)-(4), such excess shall be returned to the city. 
    The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one (1) sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(d)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city.

(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

Sec. 22-102. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
b.  Distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
c.  Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002 an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
d.  Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(2)  DROP account. The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  Total return of the assets. For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a general employee, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. A DROP participant shall be permitted to serve as an elected or appointed member of the board. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least fifteen (15) business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. In no event, however, may a member participate in the DROP beyond the date which is five (5) years from the date on which the member first becomes eligible for normal retirement. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (1) above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided in section 22-109, reemployment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a general employee, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a general employee. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a general employee. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account, A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a general employee and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half (61/2) percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either earnings or interest on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus interest or earnings earned as of that date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's 1st month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the city and no cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the member's credit during such period of continued employment. A member employed by the city after the permissible period of DROP participation will be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits and will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 22-109. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a general employee. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a general employee. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions: This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 22-103. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one (1) or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 22-108 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States Mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States Mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 22-108 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. No. 01-709, § 1, 7-2-01; Ord. No. 02-747, § 16, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 02-768, § 1, 10-21-02; Ord. No. 04-822, § 4, 10-18-04; Ord. No. 06-891, § 5, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 2016-18, § 12, 1-9-17) 
Sec. 22-109. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a general employee after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed select one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  The retiree may elect to discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon initial retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date (not including any period of DROP participation) and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of the date of the subsequent retirement (based only on the subsequent employment period. The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit; or 
(2)  The retiree may continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned if he is at least age sixty-two (62), otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until the retiree reaches age sixty-two (62) and not be an active member of the system. If this option is selected, the subsequent employment period shall have no effect upon average final compensation, years of credited service or retirement benefits. Regardless of any other provision of this system, any reemployed retiree electing to continue to receive retirement benefits shall not be reinstated as an active member of the system. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned if he is at least age sixty-two (62), otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until he reaches age sixty-two (62). Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP Participants. Retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

Former article 5 pertained to similar material and derived from Ord. No. 381, § 1(Arts. I-XVI), adopted Sept. 28, 1989; Ord. No. 445, §§ 1-6, adopted Nov. 5, 1990; 

Sec. 22-171. - Definitions. 
(a)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that benefit calculations are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund.

    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment.

(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    In addition, upon completion often (10) years of credited service, up to four (4) years of active duty in the military service of the United States with an honorable discharge, served prior to employment with the city shall be added to the years of credited service. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

    Effective date means September 28, 1989. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with the authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibilitiy is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic or highway laws of the state.

For service earned after July 1, 2011, salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year and shall also not include payments for accrued unused sick or annual leave. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year or accrued unused sick or annual leave accrued as of July 1, 2011, and attributable to service earned prior to July 1, 2011, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after July 1, 2011. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to July 1, 2011, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on July 1, 2011, or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on July 1, 2011. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year.

If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995.

(3)  All funds of the police officers' retirement plan may be deposited by the board with the finance director of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the finance director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the finance director or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' retirement plan. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' retirement plan in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280.

Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
a.  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; 
b.  Receipts and disbursements; 
c.  Benefit payments;

(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund.

1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. Ch. 185 to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including, but not limited to, common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than twenty-five (25) percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
i.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection 3. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee.

iii.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
c.  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 2, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2012-03, § 2, 5-7-12; Ord. No. 2013-09, § 2, 9-23-13; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 3, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-175. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis, funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 3, 10-19-09) 
Sec. 22-176. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service or upon the completion of twenty-three (23) years of credited service, regardless of age. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three (3) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service, with a maximum of seventy-five (75) percent of average final compensation for members hired after June 7, 1982. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for members who have accumulated more than thirty-seven and one-half (371/2) years of credited service, in no event shall such retirement benefit equal an amount less than two (2) percent for each year of the member's credited service multiplied by his average final compensation. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (1) above, reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service 
(e)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 4, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 4, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-177. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  The beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for life, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit shall be equal in value to the deceased member's accrued benefit on the date of death. 
(2)  A beneficiary may, in lieu of the benefit provided for in (1) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06) 
Sec. 22-178. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three (3) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, actuarially reduced for payment prior to the member's normal retirement date, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be sixty-two (62) percent of the member's average final compensation. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this paragraph (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this paragraph (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealthcare setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to: 
(1)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service, he shall receive a disability benefit equal to three (3) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, actuarially reduced for payment prior to the member's normal retirement date, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be twenty-five (25) percent of the average final compensation of the member. 
(2)  If the member has five (5) or more years of credited service, he shall receive a disability benefit equal to three (3) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, actuarially reduced for payment prior to the member's normal retirement date, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be twenty (20) percent of the average final compensation of the member. 
(3)  In no event shall disability benefits paid to a member who was hired on or after June 7, 1982, exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the member's average final compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for members who have accumulated more than twenty-seven and twenty-eight hundredths (27.28) years of credited service, in no event shall such disability benefit equal an amount less than two and three-quarters (2.75) percent for each year of the member's credited service multiplied by his average final compensation, not to exceed one hundred (100) percent. 
    Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the one hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 22-180(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 02-759, § 2, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 5, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-179. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined based upon his actual years of credited service, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06) 
Sec. 22-180. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only; 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security Law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  For members who do not participate in the DROP pursuant to section 22-198, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3); 
b.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3); 
c.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3); or 
d.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3). 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 22-181. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 22-177. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 22-181. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 22-176, subsection (a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 02-759, § 3, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 6, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-181. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06)

Sec. 22-185. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit . If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (5.5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the Section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account . For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect . Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations . 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 22-178, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 22-177. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 22-178, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 22-177. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans . The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 22-185, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 22-185 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the City, the limit under this subsection (h) of section Sec. 22-185 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits . Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits . 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in section 22-195 and section 22-197, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 02-759, § 4, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 7, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2013-09, § 3, 9-23-13; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 7, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-186. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection, distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to sections 22-176, 22-177, 22-179, or 22-180 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 22-177) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40l(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 22-177. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 8, 10-19-09) 
Sec. 22-187. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions.

(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and

(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 185.08. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system which violates the requirements of F.S. ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter.

Sec. 22-188. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

Sec. 22-189. - Domestic relations orders; retiree directed payments; exemption from execution, nonassignability. 
(a)  Domestic relations orders. 
(1)  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 185 and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from execution, nonassignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

Sec. 22-194. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Sections 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 02-759, § 6, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 14, 10-19-09) 
Sec. 22-195. - Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 22-171, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time police officer for any other municipal, county, state or federal law enforcement department in the United States shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of this system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  There shall be no maximum purchase of credited service for service other than with the city and such credit shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the city and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county, state or federal law enforcement department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in section 22-185, subsection (l)(2)). 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 02-759, § 7, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 09-998, § 14, 10-19-09; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 8, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-196. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as police officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 679, § 1, 6-29-00; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06) 
Sec. 22-197. - Military service prior to employment. 
    The years or fractional parts of years, in addition to the four (4) years of credit provided for in section 22-171, that a police officer serves or has served on active duty in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily and honorably or under honorable conditions, prior to first and initial employment with the city police department shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  There shall be no maximum purchase of credited service under this section and credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
(Ord. No. 02-759, § 8, 10-7-02; Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06) 
Sec. 22-198. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section 22-198, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  DROP. The City of Palmetto police officers' deferred retirement option plan. 
(2)  DROP account. The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  Total return of the assets. For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a police officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. A DROP participant shall be permitted to serve as an elected or appointed member of the board. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least fifteen (15) business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. (Any DROP participant on the date of the adoption of the ordinance deleting the previous sentence may participate in the DROP for a full sixty (60) month period). An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection 1 above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or preretirement death benefits, except as provided for in section 22-196, Reemployment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half (61/2) percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either earnings or interest on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus interest or earnings earned as of that date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will be eligible for pre-retirement death and disability benefits, and will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 22-196. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 22-194. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one (1) or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 22-198 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  ID prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the system, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the system. Upon such cancellation, the system shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of the state, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 22-198 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 8, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 22-199. - Bi-annual review of status of retirees and beneficiaries. 
    The board shall review every two (2) years, the status of all service retirees, disability retirees and beneficiaries who are receiving payments from the system for the purpose of considering whether to recommend an ad hoc increase in benefits for all such persons. For purposes of its recommendation regarding the granting of ad hoc cost-of-living increases, and in consideration of the position of the state division of retirement, the board shall make a recommendation for an increase only if the net actuarial gains experienced since the most recent adjustment are sufficient to fully purchase the value of the additional benefits. The calculation of net actuarial gains and losses shall be computed by the board's actuary using generally accepted actuarial principles, and the cost method employed in the actuarial valuation of the fund, and shall be in compliance with F.S. § 112.61. 
(Ord. No. 06-901, § 1, 10-2-06) 
Sec. 22-200. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; chapter 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 185, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants as follows: 
(1)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual "member share accounts" for all actively employed plan members and DROP participants and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member or DROP participant hereunder. Each member or DROP participant shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. ch. 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain separate member share accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(2)  Share account funding. 
a.  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015, for all members and DROP participants who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (3) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2015. 
b.  In addition, any forfeitures as provided in subsection (4), shall be allocated to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (4). 
(3)  Allocation of monies to share accounts. 
a.  Allocation of Chapter 185 contributions. 
1.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014, and prior to September 30, 2015, shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current actively employed member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
3.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each member share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of credited service of the deceased member or DROP participant. 
4.  Reemployed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
b.  Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
d.  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
e.  [Annual statements.] Members and DROP participants shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(4)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (5) shall forfeit his individual member share account or the non-vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual member share accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection (3)a. 
(5)  Eligibility for benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary) who terminates employment as a police officer with the city or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Retirement benefit. 
1.  A member shall be entitled to one (100) hundred percent of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to section 22-176, or if the member enters the DROP, upon termination of employment. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
b.  Termination benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member's employment as a police officer is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with section 22-179. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
c.  Disability benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to section 22-178 subsection (a) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to section 22-178 subsection (c), he shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
d.  Death benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member or DROP participant dies while actively employed as a police officer, one hundred (100) percent of the value of his member share account shall be paid to his designated beneficiary as provided in section 22-177. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(6)  Payment of benefits. If a member or DROP participant terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one (1) lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section 22-200 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the member share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(8)  Notional account. The member share account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member or DROP participant until the member's or DROP participant's termination from employment. The member or DROP participant has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(9)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(10)  Maximum additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, annual additions under this section shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415(c) of the Code pursuant to the provisions of section 22-185 subsection (11). 
(11)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b).

ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION, AND APPLICABILITY 

Sec. 26-1. - Purpose. 
    Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots, and blocks, and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is affected by land subdivision in many important respects. It is, therefore, in the interest of the public, the developer and the future residents, that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound practice and adequate standards. 
    The intent of these regulations is to provide for the harmonious development of the city; to assure coordination between adjacent land developments, and also to secure adequate provision for light, air, open space, recreation, transportation, potable water, flood prevention, drainage, sewers and other sanitary facilities. It is the further intent of these regulations to assure that each new subdivision result in an attractive environment, which will maintain its value over the years. 
    These standards set forth in these regulations are minimums. Subdivision plans which barely meet these minimums or are poorly designed will result in poor quality development and not comply with the above stated intent. In addition to meeting or exceeding the minimum standards, compliance with the intent of these regulations requires that good design be practiced in subdivision planning, that valuable and scenic natural features be conserved, and that adequate open spaces be dedicated and developed for public or neighborhood use. Subdivision developers should employ the skills of land planners as well as surveyors and engineers. Subdivision design should be adapted to the peculiarities and opportunities of the site, should utilize contemporary, imaginative design, avoid monotonous repetition of patterns (e.g., grid street patterns), and long, straight, minor or collector streets, and must be properly oriented with the city's and county's arterial highway plans. Size, shape and orientation of lots and blocks should be carefully considered with relation to future use. 
(Ord. No. 508, § 1, 2-7-93) 
Sec. 26-2. - Authority. 
    These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority granted by the Manatee County Planning Law, H.B. 2384, Special Acts of Florida, 1963 [Laws of Fla. 63-1599). The planning and zoning board and city council have fulfilled the requirements set forth in the law. 
(Ord. No. 508, § 1, 2-7-93) 
Sec. 26-3. - Jurisdiction. 
    These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the limits of the city as now or hereafter established.

ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 26-4.1. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, certain words, terms, and symbols are to be interpreted as follows, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
    Alley means a narrow strip of land intended for vehicular traffic which has a minimum width of twenty (20) feet, is designed to give only secondary access to the side or rear of properties whose principal frontage and access is on a street, and is legally established to provide such secondary access. 
    Arterial street means a street designed primarily for high vehicular speeds and heavy traffic volumes. They are usually characterized by signals at major intersections, channelized intersections, and where feasible, median stripe. Arterial streets serve as the links to major traffic generators, such as commercial and employment centers, and provide access to adjacent land uses. To further facilitate traffic movement, access along arterials should be controlled. The terms "arterial" or "arterial street" shall be deemed to include all streets so designated in the major thoroughfare plan of the comprehensive plan. 
    As-built drawings means drawings showing the locations, elevations, dimensions, capacity, and operational capability of structures or facilities as they have been constructed or installed. 
    Collector, major means a street designed to carry vehicles primarily from local and minor collector streets to arterial streets or major traffic generators. A major collector does provide access to residential parcels of land, but because of the higher traffic volumes, building setbacks should compensate for higher noise levels and other nuisances. The term "major collector" or "major collector street" shall be deemed to include all streets so designated in the major thoroughfare plan of the comprehensive plan. 
    Collector, minor means a street which provides for principal internal movements at moderate operating speeds within residential developments, neighborhoods and commercial or industrial areas. It also provides the primary means of circulation between adjacent neighborhoods and can serve as a local bus route. A minor collector street functions to carry traffic between arterials, major collectors, and local streets. Minor collectors may provide both land access and traffic circulation. On-street parking is usually permitted. The term "minor collector" or "minor collector street" shall be deemed to include all streets so designated in the major thoroughfare plan of the comprehensive plan. 
    Commercial subdivision means a subdivision, having an intended use of providing day-to-day retail, service and office needs of the community and that.contains permitted uses in the commercial zoning classifications of the most current zoning code of the city.

    Engineer means an engineer registered under chapter 471, F.S., who is in good standing with the board of professional engineers. 
    Flag lot means a lot meeting dimensional regulations of the assigned zoning district but utilizing an extension of the subject lot to create a private drive in order to establish exclusive legal access to such lot. Such extension shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet at the street frontage. 
    Industrial subdivision means a subdivision having an intended use of providing manufacturing, assembly, storage and distribution of products and that contains permitted uses under the CHI classification of the most current zoning code of the city. 
    Major waterways means Manatee River, Terra Ceia Bay and navigable canals. 
    Marginal service road means a street, paralleling and contiguous to an existing or proposed arterial street, designed, primarily, to promote safety by providing free access to arterial streets. All points of ingress and egress are subject to approval by the appropriate authorities. 
    Minor street means any street, not classified as arterial, major collector, or minor collector, which primarily provides direct access to residential, commercial, industrial, or other abutting property. A local street is designed to carry light volumes of traffic. Overall operating speeds are low in order to permit frequent stops or turning movements to be made with maximum safety. Service to through traffic movement shall be deliberately discouraged. 
    Planned development means a subdivision primarily residential in character, and that is developed based upon a unified development approach rather than on a lot by lot basis, and constitutes a permitted use under the PD classification of the most current zoning code of the city. 
    Plat means a map or delineated representation of the subdivision of lands, being a complete exact representation of the subdivision and other information in compliance with the requirements of all applicable sections of this and other ordinances and statutes, and may include the terms "replat", "amended plat," or "revised plat." (Section 177.031(14), F.S.) All plats shall include the square footage of each individual lot. 
    Private street means a street, way, or easement, not a component of the state system or the major thoroughfare plan of the comprehensive plan. 
    Property owner means any owner of fee title to the land in question, and may include his agents; provided that for the purposes of filing any application for a subdivision plat approval, the owners of fee title shall file such application jointly with any agents they appoint to thereafter act on their behalf in the matter. 
    Public improvements shall include streets, sidewalks, sanitary and storm sewer collection and pumping facilities, water distribution mains, parks and recreation facilities. 
    Street means a strip of land intended for vehicular or pedestrian traffic and providing the principal means of access to property, including but not limited to road, lane, drive, avenue, highway, expressway, boulevard, or any other thoroughfare.

    Subdivision means the division of a lot or parcel of land into three (3) or more lots or parcels of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership on any division of land which requires the establishment or extension of streets or other rights-of-way. The division of land into parcels of more than two and one-half (2.5) acres or reconfiguring lot lines of platted lots of record which do not create any additional lots, neither of which involve the establishment or extension of easements, streets or rights-of-way, shall not be deemed to be a subdivision as defined by this chapter. 
    Subdivision, minor means a subdivision fronting on an existing improved, public street, and meets all of the following requirements: 
(1)  All public improvements are presently provided to all of the lots; and 
(2)  Is consistent with the comprehensive plan, zoning code, and any other officially adopted plans, policies and regulations.

(Ord. No. 508, § 1, 2-7-93) 
Sec. 26-26. - General requirements. 
(a)  Generally. Prior to commencing any site work, grading, or other on-site construction activities connected with the development, except brush removal in connection with surveying, the developer shall submit construction drawings as required by section 26-14 of this chapter for the installation of all required improvements in the development or approved construction phase. Prior to approval of the final subdivision plat, the developer shall install, at his sole expense, all improvements required under these regulations in accordance with construction drawings as approved. In lieu of installation prior to final plat approval, the developer may elect to post a performance security bond for such installation in accordance with section 26-27. 
(b)  Exception. Where the development review committee determines that the installation of the following improvements may be delayed without substantial detriment to the public health, safety, or welfare or where necessary to coordinate such improvements with public expenditures or development on adjacent property, it may permit the developer to provide performance security and an agreement to install such improvements at a later specified date. Such improvements shall be limited to: 
(1)  Improvements within public right-of-way. 
(2)  Installation of sidewalks and bikeways. 
(3)  Improvements to major drainageways. 
(4)  Provision of recreational facilities in lieu of recreational open space.

(b)  Form; amount. Performance security shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the city attorney as to form and manner of execution. The amount of security shall be based upon an estimate by the engineer of record, and shall be subject to approval of the city engineer, and shall be equal to the maximum cost, adjusted for inflation during the maximum effective period of the security, for provision of the uncompleted portion of required improvements; provided, however, such amount shall not be less than one hundred thirty (130) percent of the current construction costs of such improvements. 
(c)  Sidewalks and bikeways. To minimize the risk of damage to sidewalks and bikeways during site development and building construction, the city commission may permit the posting of separate performance security and defect security for such facilities, provided the developer also enters into a sidewalk guarantee for such improvements in accordance with procedures and forms established by the city commission. 
(d)  Effective period, extensions, substitutions. The effective period of the performance security shall not exceed one (1) year from the date of approval of the final subdivision plat, but may be extended by the city commission for a additional one-year periods, provided that the city may require renegotiation of the performance security amount for each such extension. The city commission may, at any time during the effective period of the performance security, accept a substitution of principal, sureties, or other parties, upon recommendation by the city attorney. 
(e)  Approval. Performance security provided under this section shall be subject to approval by the city commission. 
(f)  Default. Where approved performance security has been provided, and the required improvements have not been installed according to the terms of the performance security instrument, the city commission may, upon ten (10) days' written notice to the parties to the instrument, declare the performance security to be in default and exercise the city's rights thereunder. Upon default, no further city permits or approval shall be granted for the project until adequate progress toward completion of the remaining required improvements is shown, as determined by the city commission. The city commission shall receive payments in full if the improvements are not completed or an extension has not been granted prior to the expiration of the performance security.

(Ord. No. 619, § A, 8-17-98) 
Sec. 27-85. - Procedure for obtaining tax exemption. 
(a)  Application. An applicant (owner of record or authorized agent) seeking an ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties must file with the administrative official or designee a two-part historic preservation property tax exemption application with "Part 1: Pre-construction Application" (Part 1) completed. In addition, the applicant shall submit the following: 
(1)  A completed application for a "certificate of appropriateness" for the qualifying restoration, renovation or rehabilitation; and, 
(2)  An application fee of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). (Note: the actual amount of the specific fee is to be determined by the administrative official based on the estimated cost of the work to be performed and the administrative costs to be incurred by the city in processing the particular application and monitoring compliance). 
(b)  Review by property appraiser's office. Upon receipt of the pre-construction application, the administrative official will transmit the application to the county property appraiser's office, which will review and provide an estimate of the probable increase in the appraisal of the property to the applicant and the city. The applicant can withdraw the application within forty-five (45) days of receiving the estimate and be reimbursed an appropriate pro-ration amount of the filing fee. 
(c)  Review by historic preservation board. 
(1)  An historic preservation board (HPB) shall be established by resolution of the city council and shall review Part 1 applications for exemptions. The HPB shall determine whether the property is an eligible property and whether Part 1 proposed improvement is consistent with the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and is therefore an eligible improvement. 
(2)  For improvements intended to protect or stabilize severely deteriorated historic properties or archaeological sites, the HPB shall apply the following standards: 
a.  Before applying protective measures that are generally of a temporary nature and imply future historic preservations work, an analysis of the actual or anticipated threats to the property shall be made; 
b.  Protective measures shall safeguard the physical condition or environment of a property or archaeological site from further deterioration or damages caused by weather or other natural, animal or human intrusions; 
c.  If any historic material or architectural features are removed, they shall be properly recorded and, if possible, stored for future study or reuse; 
d.  Stabilization shall re-establish the structural stability of a property through the reinforcement of loadbearing members or by arresting material deterioration leading to structural failure. Stabilization shall also re-establish weather resistant conditions for a property; and, 
e.  Stabilization shall be accomplished in such a manner that it detracts as little as possible from the property's appearance. When reinforcement is required to re-establish structural stability, such work shall be concealed wherever possible so as to not intrude upon or detract from the aesthetic and historical quality of the property, except where concealment would result in the alteration or destruction of historically significant material or spaces. 
(3)  For applications submitted under the provisions of section 27-84, the HPB shall also determine that the property meets the standards set forth in that section. 
(4)  The HPB shall notify the applicant and the city council, in writing, of the results of its review and shall make recommendations for correction of any planned work deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements for an eligible improvement. 
(5)  When an applicant is applying jointly for the ad valorem tax exemption and for federal historic preservation tax credits, the applicant will complete the National Park Service's (NPS) federal tax credit application Part 1 of the historic preservation property tax exemption application and submit both to the administrative official. The HPB shall defer action on the applications until the NPS has rendered a determination. In the event the NPS approves the federal tax credit application, the Part 1 application shall be amended to reflect any conditions issued by the NPS. The HPB shall then approve the tax exemption application and forward it to the city council to be handled as part of the normal approval process set forth below. A denial by the NPS shall cause the HPB to deny the ad valorem tax exemption. 
(d)  Request for review of completed work application. 
(1)  Upon completion of work specified in the "Part 1" application, the applicant shall submit a "Part 2: Final Application for Review of Completed Work" (Part 2). The HPB shall conduct an inspection of the subject property to determine whether or not the completed improvements are in compliance with the work described and conditions imposed in the approved Part 1 application. Appropriate documentation may include paid contractor's bills and canceled checks, as well as an inspection request by the applicant within two (2) years following approval of the Part 1 application; 
(2)  On completion of review of the Part 2 application, the HPB shall recommend that the city council grant or deny the exemption. The recommendation, and reasons therefor, shall be provided in writing to the applicant and to the city council. The applicant and public shall be given at least ten (10) days notice by publication pursuant to F.S. section 166.041(3)(a), of the date and time for a public hearing by the City Council to consider and act upon the requested exemption. If a denial is recommended, and the applicant submits evaluations and plans which indicate that the applicant intends to undertake the work necessary to comply with the recommendations of the HPB, the denial of the applications may be continued by the administrative official for a period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days, while the applicant may resubmit documents indicating that the reasons for recommendation of denial of the application have been remedied and the administrative official will re-inspect the work; 
(e)  Approval by city council. At the close of the referenced public hearing, a majority vote of the city council shall be required to adopt the referenced ordinance to approve a Part 2 application and authorize the ad valorem tax exemption. The city council, in approving, overturning or modifying the recommendations of the HPB, shall utilize the same standards as used by the HPB in reaching its decision. If the exemption is granted, the ordinance adopted by the city council shall include the following: 
(1)  The name of the owner and the address of the historic property for which the exemption is granted; 
(2)  The date on which the ten-year exemption will expire; 
(3)  A finding that the historic property meets the requirements of this article; and, 
(4)  A copy of the historic preservation exemption covenants, as an attachment, as provided in section 27-86, signed by the applicant and the mayor or designated successor. 
(f)  Notice of property appraiser. The property owner shall have the historic preservation exemption covenants recorded in the official public records of the county, and shall provide a certified copy of the recorded historic preservation exemption covenants to the administrative official. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the certified copy, the administrative official shall transmit a copy of the approved "Part 2: Final Application," a copy of the adopted ordinance, and the historic preservation exemption covenants to the county property appraiser with instructions that the property appraiser provide the ad valorem tax exemption to the applicant. Responsibility for paying any and all costs lie with the applicant. 
(g)  Effective date of exemption. The effective date of the ad valorem tax exemption shall be January 1 of the year following the year in which the application is approved and the ordinance adopted by the city council and a historic preservation exemption covenant has been transmitted to the county property appraiser. 
(h)  An applicant previously granted a historic rehabilitation tax exemption by HPB may undertake additional improvement projects during the exemption period, or following its expiration, and reapply for an additional historic rehabilitation tax exemption for such work. 
An additional ten-year exemption shall apply only to the additional improvement. 
(Ord. No. 619, § A, 8-17-98) 
Sec. 27-86. - Required covenant. 
(a)  Effect of covenant. To qualify for an exemption, the property owner must enter into covenants with the city for the term for which the exemption is granted. The form of the covenants shall be the "Historic Preservation Property Tax Exemption Covenant" (DOS Form No. HR3E111292) or other subsequent applicable DOS form. The covenants shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees and their heirs, successors or assigns. 
(b)  Revocation of exemption. Violation of the covenants or agreement will result in the property owner being subject to the payment of the difference between the total amount of taxes which would have been due in March in each of the previous years in which the covenants or agreement was in effect had the property not received the exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years, plus interest on the difference calculated as provided in F.S. section 212.12(3), as amended. In the event of a violation of the covenants, or damage to the historic property as detailed below, the HPB shall conduct a hearing to allow the property owner to show cause why the exemption should not be revoked. Identification of the following conditions shall result in termination of the historic property tax exemption covenants, revocation of the exemption and removal of a property from eligibility for the property tax exemption: 
(1)  The owner is in violation of the provisions of the historic preservation tax exemption covenants; or, 
(2)  The property has been damaged by accident or natural causes beyond the owner's control to the extent that the historic integrity of the features, materials, appearance, workmanship and environment or archaeological integrity which made the property eligible for listing in the national register or designation under the provisions of the local preservation ordinance have been lost or so damaged that restoration is not feasible. Under this condition, the applicant is not required to pay back interest plus taxes. 
(c)  Appeal of revocation. The applicant can appeal a decision to revoke the exemption to the city council. The procedure for appealing the decision and the conduct of the hearing will be as specified, in writing, by the city council.

Sec. 29-36. - Voluntary discontinuance of service. 
(a)  Customers wishing to discontinue the use of any utility service due to transfer of the property, demolition or other permissible reason shall give prior written notice thereof to the city clerk or designee.

If the customer shall thereafter request reinstitution of service, such customer shall deposit with the city a new security deposit in keeping with this chapter. 
(c)  For owner customers, the uncollected utility bill may constitute and be a lien upon the applicable real property. The city clerk's office shall be responsible for recording liens. The lien shall be subject to annual interest costs of not less than nine (9) percent, subject to foreclosure after one (1) year of filing and recording the lien document in the public records of Manatee County. For non-owner customers, the city shall pursue such other enforcement or collection procedures or remedies as may be allowed by law. The owner of residential or non-residential property connected to a city utility service shall be responsible for the readiness-to-serve charge during time the residential or non-residential unit is unoccupied.

If the account has not been paid within forty-five (45) days of the billing date, discontinuance of service and disconnect shall be accomplished by the city. If such final due date falls on a Friday, the disconnect date shall be the next business day. 
(b)  Habitual delinquency. The city reserves the right to increase the security deposit provided for in this chapter for any customer who has had utility services disconnected by the city because of delinquency three (3) or more times, or who has presented two (2) or more bad checks within a twelve-month period. The additional security deposit may be modified as provided for in section 29-29(e). 
(c)  Discontinuance of service. Pursuant to this chapter, non-payment of account for services when due may result in: 
(1)  Discontinuance of utility services; and 
(2)  The filing of a lawsuit in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this chapter and to recover all charges owed. 
    For reinstatement of services, the customer must pay all delinquent fees and charges. Water service will be subject to a consumption charge based on the estimated usage, other applicable charges and the city's cost of disconnection and reconnection. This provision shall apply to connection to fire hydrants and fire lines for other than testing and emergency fire fighting. 
    The city provides a comprehensive utility service relating to and including potable water, sanitary sewer, sanitation/solid waste collection, reuse water, stormwater and other collateral and ancillary services connected with the delivery of utility services. Failure to maintain current payment terms for all utility services rendered by the city may result in discontinuance of any or all utility services provided. At the discretion of the city, payment for all utility services in arrears may be required, as well as additional deposit requirements, prior to reinitiating any utility services as provided by this chapter. The utility services provided are inter-related and an integral part (both separately and collectively) of the city's plan for the delivery of total utility service in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, as well as protecting the natural environment. Therefore, the city may resort to the discontinuance of any and all utility services as a proper mechanism for the collection of accounts in arrears on any specific or individual utility service rendered, as well as enforcement of this chapter. 
(d)  Unauthorized use or consumption of water. Unauthorized use or consumption of water from the city utility system shall be subject to a consumption charge based on an estimated usage, all applicable charges and the city's cost of discontinuing service and enforcement. These costs include not only collection fees and charges, but a reasonable attorney's fee and costs of the city if the city resorts to litigation to enforce this chapter. 
(e)  Unauthorized disconnection from sanitary sewer system. Any customer connected to the sanitary sewer system who disconnects from that system, without authorization by the city, for other than repair purposes, shall be subject to the cost incurred by the city to reconnect the service to the system. The city shall have the right to enter private property for the purpose of reconnection. The delivery of sanitary sewer service to the citizens of the city is an important and integral part of the city's obligation to protect the public health, safety and welfare as well as protect the natural environment. 
(f)  Cross-connection/inter-connection. Failure to address or correct, upon notification by the city, any improper cross-connection or inter-connection of services by a specified date shall result in termination of utility service to all affected structures and the levying of appropriate charges by the city relating to such action. Customers who knowingly supply utility services to individuals, residences, businesses or units that have been disconnected by the city shall be liable for payment of the total monthly fixed charges for all units being served and a tampering charge will be levied to the customer in violation. This provision is in addition to any penalties or enforcement provided by the city's cross-connection control/regulations. 
(g)  All remedies retained. The city hereby retains the right to pursue all remedies available at law and equity to enforce this article, including, but not limited to a suit to recover damages or obtain equitable relief.

(Ord. No. 553, Art. 5, 12-4-95) 
Sec. 29-185. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports must be submitted. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the municipal system shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, including existing users which have changed their operation or processes so as to become new sources, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed below. A new source shall also be required to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged. The information required by this section includes: 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
(3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the system from the regulated processes; 
(4)  Flow measurements. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flowing gallons per day to the system from regulated process streams and other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e); 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. The industrial user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. In addition, the industrial user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be performed in accordance with procedures set out in 40 CFR Part 136. A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for Ph, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. All other pollutants will be measured by composite samples obtained through flow proportional sampling techniques. If flow proportional composite sampling is infeasible, samples may be obtained through time proportional sampling techniques or through four (4) grab samples if the user proves such a sample will be representative of the discharge; 
(6)  Special certification and compliance schedule. In accordance with sections 29-184(d)(13) and (14); 
(7)  All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 29-184(e). 
(b)  Any industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall submit periodic compliance reports. At a frequency determined by the director of public works but in no case less than twice per year, the user shall submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 29-184(e). All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. In the event an industrial user's monitoring results indicates a violation has occurred, the industrial user must immediately notify the director of public works and resample its discharge. The industrial user must report the results of the repeated sampling within thirty (30) days of discovering the first violation. 
(c)  Each industrial user is required to notify the director of public works of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or pretreatment systems which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater. The director of public works may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater permit application under section 29-184(d), if necessary. The director of public works may issue a wastewater permit application under section 29-184(g) or modify an existing wastewater permit under section 29-184(i). No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the superintendent has responded to the industrial user's notice. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of ten (10) percent or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutant shall be deemed significant. 
(d)  Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental or intentional discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to present the discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
    No industrial user which commences contribution to the system after the effective date of this article [December 4, 1995] shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. In the case of an accidental or other discharge which may cause potential problems for the municipal wastewater system, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director of public works, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the system, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(e)  Wastewater samples collected for purposes of determining industrial user compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements must be obtained using flow proportional composite collection techniques with the following exceptions: in the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director of public works may authorize the use of time proportional sampling; samples for oil and grease, temperature, Ph, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 or, if 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA and the city. 
(f)  The director of public works may recover the city's expenses incurred in collecting and analyzing samples of the industrial user's discharge by adding the costs to the industrial user's sewer charges. 
(g)  Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under 40 CFR 403.12(o). This period shall be automatically extended for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this article, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director of public works. 
(Ord. No. 553, Art. 6, 12-4-95) 
Sec. 29-186. - Violations. 
(a)  Any user who is found to have violated an order of the city council or the director of public works, or who willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this article, and the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense or imprisonment for a term not exceeding eight (8) months; or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this article or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
(b)  The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
(c)  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including initiation of legal action by the city attorney and immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall reinstate wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. 
(d)  Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating any provision of this article, the city may serve upon such user a written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for correction thereof. 
(e)  Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of no more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment for not more than eight (8) months or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(f)  A user violating any provisions of this article authorizing the aforementioned action shall be charged the actual costs for discontinuance and disconnection of said sewer services and the usual charges for recommencing sewer services. 
(Ord. No. 553, Art. 7, 12-4-95) 
Sec. 29-187. - Authority to disconnect service. 
    The city reserves the right to terminate water and wastewater disposal services and disconnect a customer from the system when:

Section 2. - [Use of public rights-of-way.] 
(a)  The facilities of the grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as to not unreasonably interfere with traffic over the public rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. 
(b)  To avoid conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the grantor may prescribe in accordance with the grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way; provided, however, that such rules or regulations: 
(i)  Shall not prohibit the exercise of the grantee's right to use said public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic, 
(ii)  Shall not unreasonably interfere with the grantee's ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of its customers, and 
(iii)  Shall not require the relocation of any of the grantee's facilities installed before or after the effective date hereof in public rights-of-way unless or until widening or otherwise changing the configuration of the paved portion of any public right-of-way used by motor vehicles causes such installed facilities to unreasonably interfere with motor vehicular traffic. 
(c)  Such rules and regulations shall recognize that above-grade facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of the public rights-of-way to the extent possible and such installation shall comply with the Florida Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways. 
(d)  When any portion of a public right-of-way is excavated by the grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the public right-of-way so excavated shall within a reasonable time and as early as practicable after such excavation be restored by the grantee at its expense and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. 
(e)  The grantor shall not be liable to the grantee for any cost or expense in connection with any relocation of the grantee's facilities required under subsection (b)(iii) of this section, except, however, the grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs from others and as may be provided by law. 
Section 3. - [Liability of grantor.] 
    The grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by the grantee of its facilities hereunder, and the acceptance of this ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the grantee to indemnify the grantor and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense, including grantor's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending itself against any such claims which may be asserted against grantor by others, which may accrue to the grantor by reason of the negligence, default or misconduct of the grantee in the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. 
Section 4. - [Rates, rules, regulations.] 
    All rates and rules and regulations established by the grantee from time to time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law.

Grantee shall continue to receive franchise payments under the current franchise agreement through the effective date of this new franchise agreement and during the period between the effective date of this new franchise agreement and the first payment hereunder. 
    The grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for public street and highway lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from other sales to public authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from sales to railroads and railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from sales for resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) late payment charges; (g) field collection charges; (h) other service charges.

    Nothing herein shall prohibit the grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the grantor shall notify the grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The grantee shall thereafter have ninety (90) days to evaluate the offer and, if the grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously-identified facilities of the grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect. 
    The parties recognize that it is the best interests of the City of Palmetto, its residents, businesses and inhabitants thereof to reduce and control the growth rates of electric consumption; to reduce the growth rates of weather-sensitive peak demand; to increase the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of electricity production and use and to encourage further development of demand-side renewable energy systems. To that end grantor and grantee agree to use their best efforts to cooperatively work each with the other to promote incentives for customer-owned and utility-owned energy efficiency and demand-side renewable energy intended to offset all or part of a customer's electricity requirements. 
Section 7. - [Termination rights; grantee.] 
    If the grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which the grantee determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The grantee shall give the grantor at least one hundred eighty (180) days' advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, advise the grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable. The grantor shall then have ninety (90) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the grantee, and the grantor and grantee agree to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable resolution of grantee's claim during this ninety-day period. If the grantee determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the grantor within said time period, and if no mutually acceptable resolution is reached by grantee and grantor through negotiation, the grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting grantor's rights to legally contest at any time grantee's determination leading to termination. 
Section 8. - [Same; grantor.] 
    If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the grantor to a customer then being served by the grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve, and the grantee reasonably determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The grantee shall give the grantor at least one hundred eighty (180) days' advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, advise the grantor of the consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The grantor shall then have ninety (90) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not remedied by the grantor within said time period, the grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting grantor's rights to legally contest at any time grantee's determination leading to termination. 
Section 9. - [Failure to comply; grantee.] 
    Failure on the part of the grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the grantee shall have six (6) months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require. 
Section 10. - [Same; grantor.] 
    Failure on the part of the grantor to comply in substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has, upon action instituted by grantee, determined to be equitable, just, and reasonable, considering the totality of the circumstances, until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) in the matter. The grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right. 
Section 11. - [Records examination.] 
    The grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within ninety (90) days after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the grantor's expense, examine the records of the grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal business hours at the grantee's office where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the grantor's expense and as the grantor and the grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the grantor, shall be reported to the grantee. The grantor's right to examine the records of the grantee in accordance with this section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. 
Section 12. - [Validity.] 
    The provisions of this ordinance are interdependent upon one another, and if any of the provisions of this ordinance are found or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, void or of no effect, the entire ordinance shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 
Section 13. - [Definition.] 
    As used herein "person" means an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a business trust, a joint stock company, a trust, an incorporated association, a joint venture, a governmental authority or any other entity of whatever nature.

    Ordinance No. 114, passed and adopted March 2, 1981 and all other ordinances and parts of ordinances and all resolutions and parts of resolutions in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed; provided, however, that the repeal of Ordinance No. 114 in no way removes grantee's obligation to remit to grantor those payments collected pursuant to Ordinance No. 114 during the term of that ordinance. The obligation for grantee to collect and remit such payments remains a continuing obligation pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
Section 15. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall take effect as provided for by law and by City, Charter, section 14, upon execution by the mayor, or if disapproval occurs, upon reconsideration by the city commission, passing of the ordinance by at least four (4) votes, and upon grantor's acceptance filed with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of adoption of this ordinance.

(Ord. No. 08-964, § 2, 4-21-08) 
Section 6. - Indemnification, emergency rights and insurance requirement. 
(a)  At all times the grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold the city harmless and, without limitation, any officer, agent, elected official or employee of the city, against any and all damage, penalty, claim, action, suit, liability, loss, cost or expense, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, which may accrue, arise, or be claimed as a result of the award of this franchise or the grantee's construction, installation, repair, operation, replacement, maintenance, upgrade or removal of the cable system hereunder, whether or not the acts or omissions complained of are authorized, allowed, or prohibited. The city, in order to assert or claim indemnification in accordance with the terms hereof, must promptly notify the grantee of the claim, action, suit or other matter giving rise to such right of indemnification; must afford the grantee the opportunity to participate in and fully control the defense, compromise, settlement, resolution or other disposition of such claim, action, suit or other matter; and, must fully cooperate in the defense against such claim, action, suit or other matter and make available to the grantee all materials and information in the possession or under the control of the city relating thereto; provided, however, the terms of a non-monetary compromise or settlement shall be submitted to the city for its review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If, after receiving written notice from the city of a matter requiring such indemnification, the grantee shall, within a reasonable time subsequent to the receipt of such notice, fail to perform its obligation to indemnify, defend and hold the city harmless, the city, upon delivery of written notice to the grantee of its default hereunder, shall have the right to retain the services of attorneys to represent the interests of the city and any other person included as an indemnified party under this section, in any such matter and the city shall be reimbursed for reasonable attorney fees and related expenses incurred by the city for such representation. The grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, replace, repair, or restore any damaged property to its prior condition and shall pay appropriate compensation in the event of any injury to or death of any individual person occasioned by any act or failure to act of the grantee, or any officer, employee, agent or subcontractor thereof, in connection with the construction, operation, maintenance or upgrade of the cable system. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the city nor any other person included as an indemnified party under this section shall be indemnified against any matter to the extent to which the city, its officers, agents, elected officials or employees or other indemnified person shall have been guilty of or liable for negligence, willful misconduct or criminal acts. 
(b)  The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster, or other emergency, as determined by the city in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the cable system, in which event the city shall not incur any liability to the grantee, or any other person. All costs to repair or replace such wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances or other parts of the cable system shall be borne by the grantee. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, except in such cases where there is a reasonable basis to suspect that a person's life, safety, or well-being is in immediate jeopardy, or where there is an immediate threat of a material loss of property, the city shall first make a reasonable attempt to notify the grantee in order to give the grantee an opportunity to take the necessary action in regard to the cable system within the time period specified by the city. 
(c)  In non-emergency situations, prior to performing any public work, public improvement, alteration of any municipal structure, any change in the grade or level of any street, or the limitation, discontinuation or temporary closing of any street, the city shall provide the grantee with advance notice of such activities at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the commencement thereof and the grantee shall, at its expense, with reasonable speed take such steps as the grantee shall deem necessary in order to protect the cable system. In the event the grantee fails to act within a reasonable time, or if the acts of the grantee are not sufficient to protect the cable system, the city shall have no liability to the grantee for any damage caused as a result of or in connection with all reasonable steps taken for the protection, breaking through, movement, removals, alteration, or relocation of any part of the cable system by or on behalf of the grantee or the city. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable if the city fails to notify the grantee of any such pending work. 
(d)  At or before the effective date, the grantee shall, at the grantee's sole cost and expense, furnish to the city a certificate or certificates evidencing that the grantee has in place a general comprehensive liability insurance policy in a form which shall insure (i) the grantee and (ii) the city and its officers, boards, commissioners, elected officials, agents and employees, as additional insureds, against liability for loss due to personal injury, death, property damage (both automobile and non-automobile caused), or other damages. Such policy or policies shall be issued by companies duly authorized to do business in the state and shall contain provisions requiring a minimum of thirty (30) days notice to the city prior to cancellation. Such policy or policies shall be issued with minimum combined single limits of liability coverage in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The foregoing limitations shall not prohibit the grantee from obtaining a liability insurance policy or policies in excess of such limitations. The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be maintained by the grantee throughout the term of this article and such other period of time during which the grantee operates or is engaged in the removal of the cable system pursuant to an extension of the franchise granted to the grantee. From time to time during the term of the franchise, the city may require the grantee to increase the minimum amount of combined single limits of liability coverage to an increased level of coverage which does not exceed the increase in the Consumer Price Index occurring from and after the effective date hereof to the date of the request for an increase in the minimum amount of combined single limits of liability coverage. "Consumer Price Index" shall mean the Consumer Price Index as now published the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics under the caption "United States City Average for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers All Items" 1982-1984 equals 100. If the Consumer Price Index shall become unavailable to the public because publication is discontinued or otherwise, or if equivalent data is not readily available to enable the city to make the adjustment contemplated hereby, the city will substitute therefore a comparable index based upon changes in the cost of living or purchasing power of the consumer dollar published by any other governmental agency.

(a)  The grantee may interrupt service for good cause only, such as to maintain, repair, upgrade or conduct FCC testing of the cable system and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations, only after prior notice to subscribers and the city of the anticipated service interruption; provided, however, planned maintenance, repair, upgrade or testing which does not require more than four (4) hours interruption of service and does not occur during prime time, shall not require such notice. 
(b)  Except for permitted interruptions under subsection 7(a), upon request grantee shall give any subscriber pro-rata credit toward his or her charges for services when service to the subscriber is interrupted for a period of four (4) hours or more and the interruption in service is not attributable to any act of the subscriber or any person on or about said subscriber's premises with the consent of the subscriber. The pro-rata credit shall be given to each subscriber for the period of time beginning when the subscriber first becomes aware of the interruption in such subscriber's service, and ending when the service is restored. The credit shall appear on the next ensuing bill prepared after the service is restored, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

Section 9. - Technical requirements. 
(a)  The cable system operated by the grantee shall be installed, maintained and operated at all times in full compliance with the technical standards of the Federal Communications Commission.

The grantee shall furnish the city with a written report of the results of the grantee's annual system proof of performance tests, as required by the FCC, within ten (10) days after receipt of a request by the city. The city, by written notice to the grantee, shall have the right to require additional proof of performance tests should the city have reasonable cause to believe that the cable system is not providing quality service transmission to the subscribers in accordance with FCC technical standards, which notice shall include the identity of the engineer selected by the city to conduct such tests. Within ten (10) days after grantee's receipt of the city's request for additional proof of performance tests the grantee shall either approve of the engineer designated by the city to conduct such tests, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; or, if the grantee does not approve of the engineer selected by the city, the grantee, within such ten-day period, shall submit an alternate selection for approval by the city, which submission shall be accompanied by the qualifications of such alternate. If the results of such tests show that the cable system is not providing service in accordance with FCC technical standards to the subscribers as required by this article, the grantee shall pay the cost of such tests. However, if such tests show that the cable system is providing service in accordance with FCC technical standards to the subscribers as required by this article, the city shall pay the cost of such tests.

(d)  On streets and roads where electrical and telephone utility wiring is installed underground, the cable system must also be installed underground. On streets and roads where electrical and telephone utility wiring is currently installed above ground but is subsequently required to be moved underground, the grantee agrees to move the cable system installation underground provided that adequate easements for such installation are available. In the event that a city street shall be vacated, the grantee agrees to remove and relocate the cable system upon the condition that the grantee is provided with an alternate easement which will permit the grantee to provide, at no greater expense, cable services to the subscribers which are being served by the cable system located within the vacated street. All of the grantee's structures and all lines, equipment, and connections in, over, under, and upon the streets of the city, wherever situated or located, shall at all times be kept and maintained by the grantee in a safe and suitable condition, and in good order and repair at the grantee's expense. If any provider of electrical or telephone utility services is compensated by city for a required relocation of its facilities underground or due to the vacation of a street and the grantee is also subject to such relocation requirement, then the grantee shall be similarly compensated by the city. 
(e)  Grantee shall give adequate advance notice to the city of any repair to or installation of cable system which will require disturbance of any city pavement, sidewalk, driveway, or other surface, grass or landscaping except that normal service drops to subscribers shall not require such advance notice.

(Ord. No. 08-964, § 2, 4-21-08) 
Section 12. - Communications services tax, franchise fees, reports and other payments. 
(a)  The communications services tax simplification law prohibits the city from regulating the terms and conditions related to franchise fees and the definition of gross revenues or other definitions or methodologies related to the payment or assessment of franchise fees on providers of cable services.

(1)  That of any other cable or video provider in the city over which the city has the authority to impose a fee; 
(2)  The amount of the local portion payable by grantee under the communications services tax simplification law; or 
(3)  The federal cap of five (5) percent of gross revenues from the provision of cable services. 
(b)  From and after the effective date and continuing thereafter during the franchise term, a franchise fee equal to five (5) percent of gross revenue shall be paid by the grantee to the city. During the franchise term the city may increase or decrease the franchise fee but in no event may the amount of the franchise fee exceed the maximum amount permitted by the cable act. The city must give the grantee adequate advance written notice of such change so that the grantee can provide notice of the date of change to its subscribers as is required by law. Grantee must pay the franchise fee due to the city on a semi-annual basis. Payment for the period January 1 through June 30 of each calendar year shall be tendered to the city not later than July 30 of the same calendar year. Payment for the period July 1 through December 31 of each calendar year shall be tendered to the city not later than January 30 of the ensuing calendar year.

Any such notice of annexation shall include a schedule identifying the street addresses of the existing residential and commercial properties located within the area to be annexed. 
(d)  At the time of payment of the franchise fee, the grantee shall provide the city with a report prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and certified by a certified public accountant or certified by a financial officer of grantee which shall reflect the gross revenue of the grantee during the preceding franchise fee period (January 1 through July 30 or July 1 through December 31) and the calculation of the franchise fee paid. 
(e)  Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, the city shall have the right to inspect the records of the grantee relating to gross revenue and, no later than six (6) months subsequent to the delivery of the semi-annual report, to audit such semi-annual report to verify the franchise fee calculation. The city shall, within such six (6) month audit period, notify the grantee of any deficiency alleged to be due as a result of such audit, which notice shall specify the reasons for such deficiency. The grantee shall have forty-five (45) days from the date of such notice to deliver to the city written notice objecting to the deficiency and specifying the reasons for such objections. If the grantee delivers notice of objection the city shall provide its written response thereto within thirty (30) days thereof. Upon receipt by the grantee of the city's response to its objections, the grantee shall, within the time period set forth in subsection 12(f) hereof, either pay the additional amount claimed or contest such claim as permitted in subsection 12(f) hereof. 
(f)  If the city claims that additional franchise fees are due the city, the grantee shall have the right to contest such claim by appearance before the city council and/or in a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the county. If the grantee contests any such claim before city council or in a court of competent jurisdiction within ninety (90) days after receipt of notice that additional franchise fees are due, then the grantee shall not be required to pay the amount claimed until such time as a final decision or judgment has been entered, or the parties agree to a settlement. 
(g)  If the result of any audit accepted by the grantee or a final judgment in a judicial proceeding relating to an audit confirms that the grantee's annual franchise fee payment to the city for the preceding calendar year should be increased by ten (10) percent or more, the cost of such audit shall be paid by the grantee. If, as a result of such audit or judicial determination, the franchise fee payment due is increased by less than ten (10) percent, all costs of the audit shall be paid by the city. 
(h)  In the event that any franchise fee or recomputed amount is not paid on or before the applicable dates specified herein, interest shall be charged from such date at the annual interest rate then chargeable for unpaid federal income taxes (26 U.S.C. § 6621). 
(i)  Subject to the time limitation of the six-month audit period provided for in subsection 12(e), acceptance of any franchise fee or portion thereof by the city shall not be construed as a waiver, release, or accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have against the grantee.

(b)  Purpose and intent. It is intended that development within the downtown core be consistent with an urban theme, combining moderate residential density with commercial activities and recreational opportunities necessary for a vibrant downtown. It is further intended that development in the downtown core be designed with carefully located buildings, parking and service areas, open space and use mixtures which are scaled and balanced to reduce general traffic congestion, by providing interdependent uses and uses which are compatible and complimentary with adjacent and surrounding land uses. Design code for the downtown core and character districts are established to ensure that public and private development projects implement the goals, objectives, policies and visions of the city's comprehensive plan, community redevelopment plan, and waterfront development plan. 
(1)  The code is to provide a means to: 
a.  Enhancing the quality of the downtown core built environment; 
b.  Achieving quality contextual design; 
c.  Achieving design that implements the vision of the character district in which the property is located, thereby promoting an identity for Palmetto; 
d.  Encouraging a diversity of architectural styles; 
e.  Providing design flexibility instead of aesthetic control; 
f.  Guiding the appropriate rehabilitation and preservation of designated historic structures; 
g.  Creating a pedestrian-oriented environment built upon the city's history and activities; and

(4)  Development permit applications shall be reviewed by the public works director, or the director's designee, for compliance with the downtown core design code. The phrase "appropriate" in the downtown core design code shall mean compliance is required with the provision. The phrase "inappropriate" in the downtown core design code shall mean that such actions are prohibited. Except as specifically provided herein, compliance is a prerequisite to issuance of a development permit. 
(5)  Applicants seeking height, density or a floor area ratio exceeding that provided in the applicable zoning regulations but permitted by the comprehensive plan and downtown core design code must rezone the subject property to planned development (PD). Site plans shall meet the PD criteria set forth in section 8.4 and be consistent with the downtown core design code. 
(6)  Where implementation of downtown core design code is inconsistent with regulations provided in an underlying zoning district or other provisions of the Palmetto Code of Ordinances, the downtown core design code shall govern, except as provided in subsection 4.4(c)(5) herein. 
(d)  Superior or equivalent alternative proposals. Where an applicant cannot or does not want to strictly comply with the requirements of the downtown core design code for improvements as required pursuant to subsection 4.4(c)(1), the applicant may propose an alternative proposal, which shall be superior or equivalent to the requirement as set forth in the downtown core design code. The applicant shall file such request with the director of public works, or the director's designee, with a copy to the community redevelopment agency director. The applicant shall identify the downtown core design code section to which the applicant proposes the alternative proposal and explain in detail how the alternative proposal is superior or equivalent to the provisions in question. 
    If the applicant is submitting the application as part of a planned development zoning application, then city may process the alternative proposal in conjunction with the PD application. If the applicant is proposing an alternative proposal in conjunction with the development that is not part of a planned development, then the matter shall be reviewed for consistency with the purpose and intent of the downtown core design code as set forth in subsection 4.4(b) of appendix B of the Palmetto Code of Ordinances. The public works director, or the director's designee, or the applicant may forward the alternative proposal to the planning and zoning board for review. 
    The planning and zoning board's decision may be appealed to the city commission as set forth in subsection 12.4(d) of the Palmetto Code of Ordinances. 
    At each level of review, if the alternative proposal is found to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the downtown core design code as set forth in subsection 4.4(b) then it may be approved, or approved with conditions. Otherwise, the alternative proposal shall be denied. 
    The following provisions of the downtown core design code are not subject to alternative proposals being proposed pursuant to this subsection 4.4(d): 
Provisions related to signs. 
(e)  Consistency with comprehensive plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of this code, construction and development within the downtown core must be consistent with all goals, policies and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan.

(a)  Lot; 
(b)  Uses of land without structures or minor structures only; 
(c)  Uses of major structures and premises; 
(d)  Structures; and/or 
(e)  Characteristics of use. 
    To be considered a nonconformity, it must have been in compliance with the zoning requirements which were lawful when it was established, but would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted by the enactment of this code or subsequent amendments hereto. A nonconformity shall be established by one (1) of the following methods: 
(a)  The nonconformity must have been legally nonconforming under the former zoning code, Ordinance No. 466, as amended, and continues to be designated nonconforming under the provisions of this code or subsequent amendments hereto; or 
(b)  The nonconformity must have been legally conforming under the former zoning code, Ordinance No. 466, as amended, and made nonconforming by the provisions of this code or subsequent amendments hereto; or 
(c)  A nonconformity is created where lawful public taking or actions pursuant to a court order have the same effect as violations of this code. 
Sec. 7.2. - Intent concerning nonconformities generally. 
    It is the intent of this code to require the cessation of certain nonconformities and to permit others to continue until they are removed or cease. It is not the intent to encourage their survival. 
    It is further the intent of this code that nonconformity shall not be used as grounds for addition of other prohibited uses or structures on the site or in the area, nor the enlarging by means of extension or expansion, except as specifically provided by this code. 
    All rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming status run with the land and are not personal to the present ownership or tenant of the land and are not affected by a change in ownership or tenancy, unless abandoned. (See sections 7.6(b) and 7.7(c)) 
Sec. 7.3. - Intent concerning nonconforming uses. 
    It is the intent of this code that nonconforming uses shall be considered to be incompatible with the permitted uses within the several districts. Such nonconforming uses shall not be intensified, enlarged or extended in any respect. 
Sec. 7.4. - Conditional uses not to be considered nonconforming. 
    Any existing use which would require a conditional use permit approval under the terms of this code shall be deemed a conforming use. However, enlargement, replacement or modification of such a use shall require approval of a conditional use permit application as though it were a new use. 
Sec. 7.5. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Use of single nonconforming lots for a single-family dwelling. In residential districts, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected, occupied and used on a nonconforming lot of record which is not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership (except as provided below) in accord with other requirements applying in the separate districts. 
(b)  Rules concerning combination of contiguous nonconforming lots in same ownership and with continuous frontage; exception. 
(1)  Combinations required, where nonconforming status was created at enactment or amendment of this code: Where two (2) or more nonconforming lots in single ownership and with continuous frontage exist, they shall be considered a single zoning lot and a zoning compliance permit authorizing their use shall only be issued when the lot area and lot width requirements for the district in which the lots are located are satisfied. Full setback requirements shall apply to all of the newly created lots. 
(2)  Use of single nonconforming lots for nonresidential uses: In nonresidential districts, a nonconforming lot of record, which is not in continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership (except as provided in (3) below), may accommodate uses permitted with all other requirements applying in that district. 
(3)  Combination not required where nonconformity created by public or court order: Where the nonconforming lots were created by the exercise of the power of eminent domain or threat thereof or as a result of a court order, combination of the lots shall not be required. 
(4)  Combination not required where fifty-one (51) percent or more of the lots within the same block do not meet the minimum frontage requirements: Where fifty-one (51) percent or more of the lots within the same block do not meet the minimum frontage requirement for the district in which the lots are located, combination is not required. In order to qualify for this exception the following conditions shall be met:

Sec. 8.5. - Development guidelines. 
    The purposes of these guidelines is to establish a general checklist for the preparation and review of the planned development proposal. The guidelines serve to identify minimum or maximum standards from which the proposal should not deviate, unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
(a)  Minimum setbacks: 
(1)  Perimeter landscaped setbacks: thirty-five (35) feet between the walls of all structures and the perimeter of the district. 
(2)  Building setback: twenty-five (25) feet from wall-to-wall between structures. 
(3)  Public or private right-of-way setback: thirty-five (35) feet from any structure to right-of-way. 
(4)  Structures over thirty-five (35) feet in height: Additional one (1) foot of setback at ground level for each additional two (2) feet of height. 
(b)  Building height: Twelve (12) stories or one hundred thirty (130) feet whichever is less. 
(c)  Minimum off-street parking and loading requirements: Refer to Ordinance No. 226 [section 28-71 et seq.] for requirements. Off-street loading shall be located and designed to ensure that it does not encroach on any public or private right-of-way. 
(d)  Frontage and accessibility for each use shall be from either a public street directly or via an approved private driveway, pedestrian way, court or other area dedicated to public or private use or common element guaranteeing access. 
(e)  Underground utilities: All utilities, including telephone, television cables, and electrical systems, shall be installed underground. Appurtenances to these systems which require aboveground installation must be screened. Primary facilities providing service to the site of the PD may be excepted. 
(f)  Solid waste containers: All central refuse, trash and garbage collection containers shall be screened from sight or located in such a manner so as not to be visible from any street within or adjacent to the PD district. Individual garbage containers not exceeding a twenty-gallon capacity are permissible. 
(g)  Public access to the waterfront, if applicable, shall be dedicated or reserved. 
(h)  As a minimum, the standard requirement for parkland shall be dedicated through the PD rezoning (e.g., 4 acres/1,000 people; projected population = 500; dedicate 2 acres). 
(i)  Minimum common open space and recreation areas: Twenty-five (25) percent of the gross site acreage shall be delineated as tracts for common open space and recreation areas. 
For purposes of this article, common open space and recreation areas are defined as the total amount of improved usable area, including outdoor space, permanently set aside and designated on the site plan as common open space or recreation area for use by residents of the PD. Common open space shall be integrated throughout the planned development or provide for a linked recreation/open space system. Such usable space may be in the form of active or passive recreation areas including, but not limited to: playgrounds, golf courses, beach frontage, nature trails and lakes. Common open space shall be improved to the extent necessary to complement the residential uses and may contain compatible and complementary structures for the benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the PD. 
Easements, parking areas, storage and utility areas, perimeter setback areas, road right-of-way and minimum yards, and minimum spacings between dwelling units may not be included in determining open space. Perimeter setback areas may be included as open space if improvements such as bikeways, pedestrian ways or equestrian trails are provided. 
Water bodies may be used to partially fulfill common open space requirements; calculations for such may not exceed fifty (50) percent of the required open space. The exclusion of water bodies which are in whole or part drainage easements may be waived by the city council after adequate measures are provided which guarantee in perpetuity a level of water quality acceptable for recreational purposes. Private navigable canals shall not be utilized in fulfilling the common open space requirement beyond that which is allowed pursuant to water bodies as previously provided. All water area included as part of the open space requirement shall be permanent water bodies and shall be improved with 5:1 minimum sloped edge extending at least twenty (20) feet into the water areas, and planted with grass and maintained around all sides so as not to harbor mosquitoes, insects and rodents, unless it is determined by an environmental review of the water body that such slope or improvements would be detrimental to the ecology of such water body site. The foregoing requirements relating to water areas to be included in the open space requirements shall apply to existing water bodies whether natural or manmade. Existing water bodies may be left in their natural state and need not be improved or sloped. 
Where a golf course is utilized to partially fulfill the open space requirement, other facilities to meet the active residential needs of children and adults shall be provided. 
Sec. 8.6. - Common lands or facilities. 
    Prior to application for final development plan approval, the petitioner shall provide a legally constituted maintenance association agreement for improving, perpetually operating, and maintaining the common facilities including private streets, drives, parking areas, and common open space and recreation facilities or shall file such documents as are necessary to show how the said common areas are to be improved, operated or maintained. 
    Such agreements may be changed from time to time provided the new agreement continues to guarantee the perpetual operation and maintenance of the common open space and recreation area and is approved by the city council. 
Sec. 8.7. - Implementation. 
    No zoning, clearance, building permit or any other permit shall be issued for a development in a PD zoning district until the conditions and requirements for obtaining such permits have been met. Following the approval of the general development plan by the city council, the developer shall be authorized to submit the required documents to proceed with the construction and development of the planned development project. 
Sec. 8.8. - Changes in approved general development plans. 
(a)  Modifications: The city council may approve any modification of an approved general development plan which is of a minor nature and not contrary to the intent and purpose of the general development plan approval.

(2)  In accord with all applicable regulations currently in effect; and 
(3)  In accord with all the conditions and requirements specified in the amendment creating the PD. 
(b)  Substantial deviation: City council shall use the following guidelines to determine if the requested changes constitute a substantial deviation: 
(1)  Any increase in intensity of use. An increase in intensity of use shall be considered to be an increase of more than five (5) percent usable floor area, or an increase of more than three (3) percent in the number of dwelling units, or an increase of more than five (5) percent in the amount of outside land area devoted to sales, displays or demonstrations. In no case shall the intensity or density be increased over the maximum permitted by the PD district in general or the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Any change in parking areas resulting in an increase or reduction of ten (10) percent or more in the number of spaces approved. 
(3)  Structural alterations significantly affecting the basic size and form of the building(s) as shown on the approved plan. Changes in form will only be considered substantial if they occur within two hundred (200) feet of the boundary of the PD district. 
(4)  Any reduction in the amount of open space of more than five (5) percent or any substantial change in the location or characteristics of open space. 
(5)  Substantial changes in location or type of pedestrian or vehicular accesses or circulation. 
(6)  An increase in traffic generation by more than ten (10) percent. 
(7)  Any increase in the area allocated to any land use type by more than ten (10) percent.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 04-828, § 4, adopted Dec. 6, 2004 and Ord. No. 06-899, § 3, adopted Aug. 21, 2006, repealed article XIII, sections 13.1-13.7, in its entirety. Former article XIII pertained to the board of adjustment. 

Secs. 13.1-13.7. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIV. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 14.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Concurrency is a term used in Chapter 163, Florida Statutes, and in 9J-5, Florida Administrative Code, to describe the situation that exists when the facilities necessary to support development are in place and operational at the same time that the development will use those facilities. 
    The concurrency management system must provide the city with the ability to make determinations that specific development projects will not degrade the levels of service below those adopted by the Palmetto City Council for any concurrency facility. To fully perform as a management system and meet the requirements established by the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, the following components of the system must be available at a minimum: 
(1)  The ability to identify existing capacities and current usage of those capacities within the defined service area for concurrency facilities. 
(2)  The ability to determine the project demand and compare that demand against available capacity. 
(3)  An updating capability that allows for the periodic correction of databases to account for expansion of capacity within facility types, new facilities and service areas, and corrections based on actual data on facility usage. 
Sec. 14.2. - Concurrency review-General requirements. 
    A concurrency determination shall be required prior to the issuance of any development permit. However, neither a draw-down of facility capacity nor a certificate of concurrency will be issued until the building permit stage. Inadequate capacity in any facility/service is grounds for denial of a development permit. The concurrency certificate shall be valid for six-months with a six-month extension or until the building permit expires, whichever is less. The development of a single-family home and a nonresidential use of less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet shall be exempt from a concurrency determination. However, note that cumulative impacts must be monitored periodically. 
Sec. 14.3. - Minimum requirements for concurrency. 
    In order to obtain a certificate of concurrency, one (1) of the following conditions must be satisfied. 
For water, wastewater, drainage and solid waste: 
(1)  Necessary facilities and services are in place at the time the development permit is issued; or 
(2)  Necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur (a conditional development permit); or 
(3)  Necessary facilities are under construction at the time the permit is issued; or 
(4)  Necessary facilities/services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement pursuant to Sections 163.3220 through 163.3243, Florida Statutes or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to Chapter 380, Florida Statutes; or 
For transportation and recreation/open space, any one (1) of the above and: 
(5)  Necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract between the city and a contractor which provides for the commencement of actual construction or provision of services within one (1) year after the issuance of a development permit. 
Sec. 14.4. - Facility/service demand calculations. 
    The following calculations shall be used to determine the projected demand of the proposed project described in an application for a development permit on the public facilities and services. The calculations are listed by public facility and service type. The city clerk or his designee shall be authorized to review calculations in paragraphs (a) through (f). All required data shall be provided by the applicant to the city. 
(a)  Potable water: 
Adopted LOS = 105 gal./day/capita (nonresidential uses are included in the adopted LOS) 
105 gal. × 2.2 persons/household × _______ units = demand 
(b)  Wastewater: 
Adopted LOS = 100 gal./day/capita (nonresidential uses are included in the adopted LOS) 
100 gal. × 2.2 persons/household × _______ units = demand 
(c)  Stormwater management (drainage): 
Adopted LOS = 25-year, 24-hour storm event. 
Drainage calculations shall meet the standards adopted in the City of Palmetto Engineering Design Criteria Manual and the Palmetto Comprehensive Plan. 
(d)  Solid waste: 
Adopted LOS = 7.1 lbs./day/capita (nonresidential uses are included in the adopted LOS) 
7.1 lbs. × 2.2 persons/household × _______ units = demand 
(e)  Recreation: 
Refer to the Palmetto Comprehensive Plan for the adopted level of service standards. 
Project population = _______ units x 2.2 persons/household 
Project population/LOS = demand 
(f)  Transportation: 
Refer to the Palmetto Comprehensive Plan for the adopted level of service standards. 
(1)  Determine the number of trips generated by the proposed project during the p.m. peak hour, using the most recent edition of the ITE Trip Generation Report, with no adjustment for internal capture or passerby trips. 
(2)  If the total number of trips is equal to or greater than fifty (50) trips, a transportation study shall be done. The report shall be signed and/or sealed by either a registered professional engineer or a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. 
a.  If no transportation study is required, the applicant is required to provide only the existing directional p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and level of service for the roadway link to which project driveways connect. This information shall include project traffic. 
b.  The data shall be in conformance with section 14.6(c), notes a. and b. 
Sec. 14.5. - Performance of transportation study. 
    If a transportation study is required, it shall be performed by a registered professional engineer or a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. 
    The transportation study shall be performed in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 14.6 hereof. 
Sec. 14.6. - Requirements of transportation study. 
(a)  Preapplication meeting: A preapplication meeting between the city and the applicant is required. The purpose of this meeting will be to review the methodology and procedure, and to determine the study period. This will usually be a p.m. peak hour analysis; however, other time periods may require analysis. 
(b)  Define study area: The study area is defined as roadways impacted by the project at four and one-half (4.5) percent of LOS "D" capacity. 
(c)  Existing conditions: The following existing conditions shall be provided: 
(1)  Existing directional p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and level service on all collectors and arterials within the study area. 
(2)  Existing turning movement volumes at the impacted intersection(s) and intersection(s) level(s) of service. 
Notes: 
a.  The above required data shall be no older than the previous calendar year. Volumes shall be adjusted to reflect annual conditions using current FDOT seasonal adjustment factors for Manatee County or other adjustment factors approved by the city. 
b.  The above required level(s) of service for roadways shall be determined in accordance with current FDOT generalized service volume procedures. 
c.  The above required intersection capacity(s) shall be determined using computer software based on the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council. 
(d)  Projection of background traffic: Volume(s) shall be projected for the year of project completion. Volumes can be determined using one (1) of the following procedures: 
(1)  Multiply existing volumes by an annual growth factor provided by the city. Traffic generated by any major project approved since the traffic counts were conducted shall be included as background traffic. 
(2)  Multiply existing volumes by an annual growth factor developed by the applicant and approved by the city. This growth factor must be based on data collected on three (3) roadways in the vicinity of the project over the last three (3) years. Traffic generated by any major project approved since the traffic counts were conducted shall be included as background traffic. 
(3)  Develop a computer model. 
(e)  Project traffic generation: The following procedures and information shall be provided: 
(1)  To determine project traffic generation, the current edition of the ITE Trip Generation Report shall be used. 
(2)  Identify all land use codes, amount of development and trip rates. 
(3)  Trip rates may be obtained from studies of comparable sites in the City of Palmetto or using data from previous traffic generation studies. The city must approve the trip rates. 
(4)  Any proposed reduction factors for capture of trips between land uses of a mixed use project or for passerby trips shall be provided by the applicant at the preapplication/methodology meeting and approved by the city. 
(f)  Project traffic distribution: One (1) of the following methods shall be used: 
(1)  If the project generates fewer than one hundred (100) peak hour trips, the distribution can be developed based upon those of similar projects. 
(2)  For any project, manual gravity model distribution can be developed. The travel-time method described in Chapter 3 of ITE Transportation and Land Development shall be used. 
(3)  For any project, a computerized distribution model, such as FSUTMS or QRSII, can be developed. 
    Note: The applicant for a development permit shall provide the city with all information required by the city so as to enable the concurrency evaluation. This includes all of the information required for calculating projected demand for certificates of concurrency. 
Sec. 14.7. - Alternative demand calculations. 
    If the applicant claims the standards provided in the demand calculations are not applicable to the proposed project, the applicant shall submit appropriate documentation supporting the proposed alternative demand calculation to the city. Any alternative calculation standard shall be subject to the approval of the city clerk or his designee. 
Sec. 14.8. - Appeals. 
    Any appeal of a decision to deny a certificate of concurrency shall be received in writing within ten (10) working days to the office of the city clerk. The appeal request will be heard by the board of adjustment. 
Sec. 14.9. - Proportionate fair-share. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this section 14.9 and other provisions of this code, the provisions of this section 14.9 shall control. 
(b)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city's concurrency management system, including transportation facilities maintained by FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c), below. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in section 14.2 of this code and F.S. § 163.3180. 
(c)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
b.  The five-year schedule of the capital improvements in the city's capital improvement element of the comprehensive plan (CIE), or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system (CMS), includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS. The provisions of subsection (2), below, may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS, where the following apply: 
a.  The city adopts, by resolution, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this subsection (2), the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city commission, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16), consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Financial feasibility for this subsection (2) means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten (10) years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
b.  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one (1) or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways and those of FDOT for the state highway system. 
(d)  Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination element of the city's comprehensive plan and applicable policies in any adopted intergovernmental transportation plans, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(e)  Application process. 
(1)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c). 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a preapplication meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the SIS, then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee of three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) and the following: 
a.  Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of property; 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s); and 
g.  Copy of concurrency application. 
(4)  The public works director, or his designee, shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within twenty (20) business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in subsection (c), then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten (10) business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The city commission may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed sixty (60) days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than sixty (60) days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than fourteen (14) days prior to the city commission meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The city shall notify the applicant of the date of the city commission meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the city commission, or pursuant to staff approval for agreements below twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). 
(f)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
    "The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = s[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: Development Trips;sub \sub;= Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV Increase;sub \sub;= Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection (c); 
Cost;sub \sub;= Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or FDOT work program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one (1) of the following methods: 
a.  An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission. Project costs shall be adjusted to accommodate for increases in construction material costs due to inflation and other economic factors. 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT Work Program shall be determined using this method in coordination with FDOT District 1. 
(5)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one (1) of the methods provided in this subsection (f). 
(6)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site-related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the most recent assessed value by the property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city-estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(g)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  This subsection (g) shall apply when impact fees are being imposed on developers, developing property within the city. 
(2)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local government's impact fee ordinance. 
(3)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per any city impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of any city impact fee ordinance. 
(4)  Major projects not included within an impact fee ordinance or created under subsection (c)(2)a. and b., above, which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the government's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(5)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within an impact fee ordinance. 
(h)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) and in accordance with the requirements of section 14.2, concurrency review, the applicant shall receive a city certificate of level of service. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within three (3) years of the execution of the agreement, then the agreement and the certificate of level of service shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. The executed agreement shall satisfy the contract requirement in section 14.3. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection (f) and adjusted accordingly. 
(3)  All developer improvements authorized under subsection (f)(5) must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this subsection that any such required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to approval of a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from a proposed proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be nonrefundable. 
(7)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(i)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the city, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under FDOT TRIP. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c)(2)b., above. 
Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. section 339.155, then the city may coordinate with the other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(3)  The city shall include terms and conditions in all proportionate fair-share agreements to address reimbursing the applicant in the event that applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under subsection (f), above. 
(j)  Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the city is authorized to enter an agreement with one (1) or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this subsection to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(2)  A development application submitted to the city subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this subsection: 
a.  All or part of the proposed development is located within ten (10) miles of the area which is under the jurisdiction, for transportation concurrency, of an adjacent local government; and 
b.  Using its own concurrency analysis procedures, the city concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five (5) percent or more of the adopted peak hour LOS maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government ("impacted regional facility"); and 
c.  The impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by the adjacent local government, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsection (j)(2)a. through c. above, the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
a.  The adjacent local government shall have up to ninety (90) days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. section 163.3180(16), Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this subsection, then the provisions of this subsection would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair-share requirements of the city. 
b.  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the city, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied. The city may require the adjacent local government to declare, in a resolution, ordinance, or equivalent document, its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant. 
(k)  Appeals. Appeals for reconsideration of any city determination made pursuant to this section shall be done in writing within ten (10) days. Reconsideration shall be at the discretion of the official, board, or commission making the original determination. Any determination made after reconsideration shall be final and shall be made in writing no more than forty-five (45) days following the receipt of the reconsideration request.

(2)  The design of all telecommunication equipment buildings, towers, and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. 
(3)  For antennae installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
(4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(5)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or antennae within the city. 
(Ord. No. 618, § 4, 8-3-98) 
Sec. 17.10. - Setbacks and separation. 
    The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all telecommunication towers and facilities. 
(1)  Towers shall be setback a distance equal to one foot for every foot of tower height to any public right-of-way or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower. The city council may reduce this setback upon a showing that the collapse zone is less than this distance, however, in no event can the setback be less than the minimums established for the zoning district in which the tower is located. 
(2)  Telecommunication equipment buildings shall meet the setback requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(3)  Towers which are one-hundred fifty (150) feet or greater in height shall not be located closer than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet from any existing tower that is one hundred (100) feet or greater in height. Towers which are one hundred (100) feet or greater in height shall not be located closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from any other tower. 
(4)  Antennae which are mounted on existing structures (i.e. water towers or other tall structures) must meet the minimum setback requirements for the district in which the structure is located. 
(Ord. No. 618, § 4, 8-3-98) 
Sec. 17.11. - Pre-existing towers and antennae. 
    Any tower or antennae for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this article shall not be required to meet the provisions of this article except for sections 17.13 and 17.14. If an additional antennae is proposed to be co-located on a pre-existing tower, the screening and landscaping requirements of section 17.6(6) and 17.12 shall be met. 
(Ord. No. 618, § 4, 8-3-98) 
Sec. 17.12. - Landscaping. 
    The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers. 
(1)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, telecommunication facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower and equipment building. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the facility. Landscaped strips shall satisfy the minimum design and planting requirements for buffers established in chapter 7 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, this area may be utilized to provide the required buffer. 
(Ord. No. 618, § 4, 8-3-98) 
Sec. 17.13. - Federal requirements. 
    All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennae governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Extensions may be granted by city council upon a showing of good cause. Failure to bring towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute a violation of this ordinance are grounds for fines or revocation of the conditional use permit. After a public hearing, the city council may remove the tower or antennae at the owner's expense. A lien may be placed on the property to recover said costs. 
(Ord. No. 618, § 4, 8-3-98) 
Sec. 17.14. - Building codes-Safety standards. 
    To ensure the structural integrity of towers and antennae, the owner of a tower or antennae shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers and antennae that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If a tower or antennae fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice the owner, of the telecommunications facility, shall have fifteen (15) days to bring the facility into compliance with such standards. If the owner, fails to bring the facility into compliance within the fifteen (15) days, the city may remove the facility at the owner's expense. Prior to the removal of any facility, the city may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, for repair of substandard facilities, and may grant a reasonable extension as determined by the city council of the above referenced compliance period. A lien may be placed on the property to recover said costs.

If at any time the use of the facility is discontinued for ninety (90) days, the city may declare the facility abandoned. (This excludes any dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility.) "Discontinued" shall mean that the structure has not been properly maintained, has been abandoned, become obsolete, is unused or has ceased the daily activities or operations for which it is permitted. The facility's owner will receive written notice from the city, and be instructed to either re-activate the facility's use within thirty (30) days or dismantle and remove the facility. If reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the city shall schedule a public hearing to determine the action to be taken. 
(2)  After such hearing has been provided, the city shall have the authority to initiate proceedings to either acquire the facility and any appurtenances attached thereto at the then fair market value, or in the alternative, order the removal of the facility and all appurtenances, at owner's expense. A lien may be placed on the property to recover said costs. 
(3)  No telecommunications tower shall be constructed, replaced or altered without obtaining the applicable building permits.

The insurance shall provide uninterrupted coverage of not less than five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for personal injury to each person and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for each occurrence involving property damage, plus costs of defense. The policy shall provide that the insurance shall not be canceled or materially altered without thirty (30) days written notice first being given to the city. 
(2)  Maintain on file with city a certificate of the insurance required by section (1) above. Failure to maintain insurance coverage or to provide proof of insurance shall constitute a violation of this article and grounds for fines and/or revocation of the conditional use permit. 
(3)  Provide specific performance bond from a company authorized to do business in Florida to the city as guarantee of fulfillment of the owner's obligation to remove the telecommunication tower and facilities upon its abandonment or discontinuation of use. The amount of the bond shall be equal to the removal and disposal cost as certified by a cost estimate submitted by an engineer approved by the city. Failure to maintain such bond or to show proof of such bond upon request of the city shall constitute a violation of this article and shall be grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit. The performance bond may be invoked in accordance with the procedures set forth therein by the city upon a determination by the city council that the tower has been abandoned and that the owner has failed to remove it as required by this article. 
(4)  Provide a copy FCC's permits or a copy of documents showing the applicant has applied for a permit from the FCC showing their status as a telecommunications provider and/or carrier doing business as either a wireless, PCS or other telecommunications provider.
