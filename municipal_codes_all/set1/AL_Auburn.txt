PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Auburn, Alabama, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, The Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code where the City's 1956 Code, as supplemented through January 2, 1968 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1956 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 15 and 16 it will be designated as Chapter 15.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 7-18. - Statutory authorizations. 
    The legislature of the State of Alabama has in Code of Ala. 1975, tit. 11, ch. 19, §§ 1-24, ch. 45, §§ 1-11, ch. 52, §§ 1-84, and tit. 41, ch. 9, § 166, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Auburn, Alabama, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-19. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Auburn, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-20. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-21. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11)

Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 7-40(4). 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be flood proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above in subsection 7-37. 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
(a)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: 
1.  Individual lots or parcels, 
2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(b)  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) and is elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet) above grade. 
(c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (refer to section 7-40). 
(d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (a) and (c), above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 7-23 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(b)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
(c)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12 [sic], and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(d)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(e)  Only if subsection (4)(b) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-42. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 7-23, where streams exist but where no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 7-23, then the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3 of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of division 3, section 7-40 and section 7-41. 
(4)  In special flood hazard area without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of division 3, section 7-41, paragraph (3)(b)2. in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 7-40(4). The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-43. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 7-23 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 7-40(4). The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed) above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 7-41(2) and 7-36(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-44. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development including manufactured home parks and subdivisions greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less. 
(Ord. No. 2723, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-45. - Variance procedures.[4] 
(a)  The board of zoning adjustment (BZA)* as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the BZA may appeal such decision to the circuit court of the county, as provided in the Code of Ala., 1975. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the BZA shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal and state emergency management agencies upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this article.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §44, Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE III. - EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2742, § 1, adopted Jan. 17, 2012, repealed the former Art. III, §§ 7-70-70-80, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2053, § 2, May 7, 2002; Ord. No. 2191, § 1, Jan. 20, 2004; Ord. No. 2258, §§ 1-3, 5, Dec. 7, 2004; and Ord. No. 2296, § 1, May 17, 2005. 

Sec. 7-70. - Introduction. 
    During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
    The purpose of this policy is to safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in Lee County, Alabama. This policy will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any applicable activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the City of Auburn. Additionally, this policy reinforces the need for those sites less than one acre in size to be classified as "Permit by Rule" construction sites required to implement and maintain best management practices until land disturbing activities have ceased and permanent stabilization has been achieved.

(Ord. No. 1842, § 2, 7-6-99; Ord. No. 2054, § 3.1, 5-7-02; Ord. No. 2531, § 1, 12-4-07) 
Sec. 12-13. - Administrative procedures. 
(a)  License requirement. It shall be unlawful for any business to operate in the City of Auburn without first obtaining a business license unless specifically exempted from such requirement by this article. If any business is engaged in two (2) or more activities and if less than twenty (20) per cent of the gross receipts of the business is attributable to the operation of the activities that are not included within the primary activities of the business, all of the gross receipts can be reported under the business license for the primary business activity and additional business licenses will not be required. If a business is engaged in two (2) or more activities and if more than twenty (20) per cent of the gross receipts of the business is attributable to the operation of the activities that are not included within the primary activities of the business, a separate business license will be required for each of the non-primary business activities the gross receipts of which are twenty (20) per cent or more of the gross receipts of the primary business activity. For example, if a business has a primary activity from which seventy-five (75) per cent of its gross receipts are derived and two (2) additional business activities from which fifteen (15) per cent and ten (10) per cent of its gross receipts are derived, the business would be required to obtain a business license for the seventy-five (75) per cent activity and the fifteen (15) per cent activity and the gross receipts from the ten (10) per cent activity would be included with the gross receipts of the seventy-five (75) per cent activity for the purposes of calculating the business license fee (15% divided by 75% = 20% but 10% divided by 75% = 13%). 
(b)  License renewal form. The city shall provide each currently licensed business a license renewal form for the upcoming year. These forms shall be mailed via the U.S. Postal Service by the last business day of each calendar year. Each license issued for a business continuing in operations at the end of a year shall be due for renewal on the first business day of each succeeding calendar year, and such license shall become delinquent the day following February 15th. 
    The city cannot be responsible for the timely mail delivery of the renewal forms. Failure to receive the business license renewal form, for whatever reason, will not excuse a business for failure to renew its business license by the stated deadline. Any business submitting a license renewal form which files the renewal application after the due date shall be charged all applicable penalties as set forth in section 12-14(g) of this article. 
(c)  Expiration of license. The penalty portion of this article shall be applicable if the license fee for a given calendar year is not paid by the 15 th day of February of that calendar year, or if the 15 th falls on the weekend, then if not paid by the next business day, except for insurance companies, whose business license fee must be paid on March 1 as in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-188. 
(d)  License not transferable. A license issued under this article shall not be transferred from the business purchasing such license to another business. Each business applying for a license required or provided for by this article shall state the name of the business and the location where the business shall operate under the license for which it applied; and the license shall permit the operation of that business only under that name and ownership and at the place designated. If the location or the name of the business is changed during the license period, the licensee shall so notify the city manager in writing; and the city manager will authorize the issuance of a new license certificate reflecting the new location or new name of the business, and for the remaining time of the license period no new license shall be required for the same owner to operate the same business under the new name or at the new location. Otherwise, a new business license application and fee shall be required for each change of owner, name of business or location. 
(e)  License not refundable. No business license fee or portion thereof paid to the city and properly due to the city when paid shall be refunded to a licensee. 
(f)  License term; proration. 
(1)  All licenses shall be for one calendar year, beginning on January 1 st of each year and ending on December 31 st of each year. All licenses issued under the authority of this article, whether issued on or after January 1 st of the year for which they are issued, shall expire on December 31 st of the same calendar year. 
(2)  Any business, other than a transient merchant, not previously licensed by the city and beginning business operations in the city between and including January 1 st and June 30 th in the calendar year must obtain an initial whole-year license for one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any business, other than a transient merchant, not previously licensed by the city and beginning business operations in the city on July 1 st or later in the calendar year must obtain an initial half-year license upon payment of one-half the amount ($50.00) of the initial annual license tax. Conducting business operations in the city for any portion of a month shall be counted as a full month. Transient merchants shall pay business license fees as specified in section 12-17(b), Category 15 of this article. 
(3)  If a business, other than a transient merchant, ceases to operate between December 31 st of the preceding year and the last business day of February, a full year's business license fee will be required based on the gross receipts of the previous calendar year with a minimum license fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each business category, unless otherwise provided herein. 
(g)  Licensee to render report. Where the amount of the business license fee is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the business applying for such license shall render to the city manager a declaration giving the information upon which the amount of license fee is measured, and any further proof of the gross receipts of the business that the city manager may require. 
(h)  Computation of license fee. 
(1)  Wherever in this article it is specified that the amount of the license fee, or any part thereof, upon renewal is to be computed upon the basis of gross receipts of the business, the gross receipts shall be the gross receipts of the business for the calendar year next preceding the current license year, unless otherwise specifically provided herein. 
(2)  Any business not previously licensed by the city and beginning business operations in the city between and including January 1 st and June 30 th in the calendar year, must obtain an initial whole-year license for one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any business not previously licensed by the city and beginning business operations on July 1 st or later in the calendar year must obtain an initial half-year license upon payment of one-half of the amount of the initial annual license tax, which amount is fifty dollars ($50.00). Conducting business operations in the city in any portion of a month shall be counted as a full month. When the business license is renewed for the first time, the license for the renewal year will be calculated based on the actual gross receipts of the business for the first calendar year or portion thereof. 
(Ord. No. 1842, § 3, 7-6-99; Ord. No. 2054, § 3.2, 5-7-02; Ord. No. 2521, § 1, 10-16-07; Ord. No. 2730, § 1, 11-1-11)

In addition, such business shall file with the city manager a certificate signed by a county agricultural agent certifying that said business is a bona fide grower or producer of the kind of farm products which said business proposes to sell in the city. 
(5)  Any person offering parking spaces on private property for rental on Auburn University football home game days shall be exempt from the requirement to obtain a business license, provided that such person owns the private property on which parking space is being offered for rent; or, if the person offering parking spaces for rent on Auburn University football home game days is not the owner of the private property on which parking spaces are to be offered for rent, such person must first obtain written permission from the property owner to use the private property to provide parking spaces for rent on Auburn University football home game days.

b.  The projected amount of the fees to be paid to such individual or firm during the specified calendar year by the City of Auburn for goods or services to be provided to the city government during the specified calendar year is less than the then current state bid law minimum (which at the time of adoption of the amending ordinance from which this subsection derives is seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00)); and 
c.  The individual or firm so engaged has executed a written statement, a "statement to claim exemption" under section 12-14(b)(6), certifying to the city manager that the individual or firm has not conducted any business within the city limits of the City of Auburn, other than with the city government, and does not anticipate conducting any business within the city limits, other than with the city government during the specified calendar year; and further certifying that: 
1.  If such individual or firm receives during the specified calendar year either fees from the City of Auburn for goods or services exceeding the then current state bid law minimum or fees from other entities for doing business within the city limits, then such individual or firm acknowledges that the individual or firm will no longer be exempt from the business licensing provisions of this article; and 
2.  If such individual or firm was exempt from the business licensing provisions of this article, as amended, under the terms of this subsection 12-14(b)(6), and later, during the same calendar year, shall fail to qualify for the exemption provided under this subsection 12-14(b)(6), such individual or firm shall be subject to all provisions of this article, as amended, which includes the requirements to keep records, to make records available to the City of Auburn, to pay business license fees and any late penalties and interest which may be due thereon, and all other provisions of this article, as amended and as may be amended; and

(c)  Designation of place of business. All businesses operating in the city shall designate in writing on the business license application form each location where business operations are conducted. The business license shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the designated location of business at all times.

Businesses violating any of the provisions of this article, or doing any act made unlawful by the terms of this article, are declared to have committed an offense against the city, and shall upon conviction, be fined in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-93. 
(4)  A business found by the department to be conducting business operations in the city without having applied for and been issued a business license for the current calendar year and which in previous years has been licensed will be subject to a penalty of three (3) times the minimum license fee for that category in such current calendar year.

These penalties are in addition to any late fees and interest that may also be assessed under the provisions of this article. All remedies under these penalty provisions are cumulative and do not modify any civil or criminal action provided for by law. 
(i)  Records to be kept. In addition to all other requirements otherwise contained in this article, businesses shall keep and maintain an accurate and complete set of accounting records and other related information sufficient to enable the department to determine the correct amount of gross receipts or correct amount of any license fee due, or other records or information as may be necessary for the proper administration of any matter under the provisions of this article in such form as the department may require. Such records and other information shall be open for examination by the department upon written request at a reasonable time and location. It shall also be the duty of every business to keep and preserve such records and other information for a period of not less than five (5) years from the due date of the business license application or renewal application on which the underlying license fee is required to be reported, or within five (5) years of the date the business license application or renewal application is filed, whichever is later. 
(1)  Reasonable time and reasonable location. "Reasonable time" shall be considered to be during normal business hours of the department. "Reasonable location" shall be considered to be the business' place of business or the offices of the business' authorized representative, provided such business or representative is located within a thirty (30) mile radius of the city. Businesses maintaining such records outside of this radius must make such records available at city hall or at such other location as agreed upon between the business and the department. The department, when conducting an audit, review, or examination for verification, may, at its election, require any business conducting business within the city to provide the accounting records and other documents at a reasonable time and reasonable place agreed upon between the business and the department, as provided herein. 
(2)  Businesses may be assessed reasonable costs. The department may assess and collect from businesses the reasonable costs, based on the then current State of Alabama government per diem rates, incurred by, or charged to, the city in connection with performing an examination of the business' books and records if the business received notice by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the examination was to begin, and 
a.  The business either failed or refused to respond or did not propose a reasonable alternative date on which the examination was to commence within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice of the pending examination, or if 
b.  The business and the department agreed in writing as to an alternative date on which the examination was to commence but the business then failed or refused to permit reasonable access to its books and records on the alternative date. 
(3)  Separate records to be maintained where liquor sold. It shall be the duty of each business selling beer and/or spirituous and vinous liquors, and intermingling the receipts from such sales with receipts of the licensee's other business to keep a separate intelligible record of each beer and/or spirituous and vinous liquor sale. Where no such records are maintained, the department may immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of such license tax due plus applicable penalties; or, if the department determines that the collection of such license tax will be impaired unless immediate collection efforts are commenced, the department may at any time enter a final jeopardy assessment, pursuant to Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-29-91. 
(j)  Investigative powers. Each business shall give to the finance director the means, facilities and opportunity for the making of such audit, examination, and investigation of the accounting records and other relevant information maintained by the licensee or other person for the purpose of computing and determining the proper classification of such business for license fee purposes, as provided for in subsection 12-14(i). The finance director is hereby authorized to examine any person under oath concerning any gross receipts which were or should have been shown on a business license application or renewal application, and to this end, he/she may compel the production of documents and the attendance of all persons before him/her, whether as parties or as witnesses, whom he/she believes to have knowledge of such gross receipts. 
(1)  Any business, or officer of a corporation or association, or partner of a partnership, or fiduciary of a trust, or responsible individual of any entity under a duty to maintain books and records pursuant to this article, who fails or refuses to maintain or provide such records and books, or permit inspection, as required herein, shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 12-15(a) of this article, and shall be subject to proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(k)  Audit and subpoena authority; additional requirements. Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-2A-7(a), outlines further requirements for the maintenance of taxpayer records, in addition to the record keeping requirements set forth in subsection 12-14(i) of this article. The department's authority to audit, to subpoena records, and to enter into contracts with private examining or collecting firms is granted pursuant to Act No. 98-191, the "Local Tax Procedures Act of 1998", as well as Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-2A-7(a). 
(l)  Lien for taxes. If any business liable to pay the business license fees herein levied, neglects or refuses to pay the same within thirty (30) days of a final assessment of such fees, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty together with filing fees and any other cost that may accrue thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the city upon all property and rights to property of the business, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, used in any exhibition, trade, business, vocation, occupation or profession for which a privilege or license tax is or may be required. 
    The department shall give a ten (10) day "notice of intent to file lien" to the business by any one of the following methods: 
(1)  Given in person; 
(2)  Left at the business location or the dwelling of the business owner or the duly authorized representative of the business owner; or 
(3)  Sent by certified mail with return receipt requested to the business' last known address. 
    Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien shall arise at the time of the final assessment and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time. 
    The department may enforce such lien in any court of competent jurisdiction, by attachment issued by any officer authorized to issue such writs, upon executing bond as in any other cases of attachment, and upon making an affidavit that the attachment is not issued for the purpose of vexing or harassing the defendant, and describing the property on which the lien is claimed and setting forth all the facts necessary to the creation of the lien and the amount due and unpaid. 
    Liens against real property will be filed in the Office of the Probate Judge of Lee County. Liens against personal property will be filed in the Office of Secretary State of the State of Alabama. The lien will be valid when perfected by the Probate Judge of Lee County or the Alabama Secretary of State. All liens are pursuant to Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 40-29-20, 40-29-21, 40-29-23(e)(2) and 11-51-96. 
    With respect to the lien described in this subsection 12-14(l), the department shall within ten (10) days release the lien when the liability out of which such lien arose is satisfied, and shall promptly notify the person upon whom such lien was made that such lien has been released. 
(m)  Remedies cumulative. The conviction and fine or imprisonment of any business owner for engaging in any business without first obtaining a license to conduct such business shall not relieve such business owner from paying the license fee to conduct such business, nor shall the payment of any license fee prevent a civil action or criminal prosecution for the violation of any of the provisions of this article. All remedies prescribed hereunder shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the department shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions hereof. 
(n)  Violator may be restrained from continuing in business. Any business which shall violate any of the provisions of this article may be restrained from continuing in business in the city, and proper prosecution shall be instituted in the name of the city until such business shall have complied with the provisions of this article. 
(o)  Waiver of penalties. The city is authorized to reduce or waive penalties upon a determination of reasonable cause. Reasonable cause shall include, but not be limited to, those instances where the business has acted in good faith in filing a business license application or renewal application and paying any business license fee due. However, the burden of proving reasonable cause shall be on the business. In order to appeal an assessed penalty, the business shall submit a formal written request for such waiver to the finance director, describing the circumstances which resulted in the penalty assessment and requesting that the assessment be waived. Such request is due to the finance director within thirty (30) days of the penalty assessment in question. The finance director shall respond to the request within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request in the finance director's office.

Sec. 12-63. - Return to be filed by employee. 
    An annual return to be filed by the employee, Auburn form WT-2, showing an employee's gross receipts subject to license fees, is required to be filed on or before January 31 of each year when his employer does not file a return in form and substance satisfactory to the city manager and the license fees are not paid by the employer.

Sec. 12-64. - Submission of questions. 
    Any license payer or employer desiring a specific ruling should submit all of the facts involved, in writing, together with a concise statement of the subject matter of the ruling sought, to the city manager.

The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O and M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by the professional engineer responsible for the design of the facilities. 
(b)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the city engineer and approval authority monthly reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceed the approved average daily flow. At the discretion of the city engineer and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city engineer may agree to alter the dates on which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(2)  The city engineer may impose mass limitations on users in cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the city engineer, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator. 
(3)  When the city has independent tests performed and the concentrations exceed permit limits, the user will pay all testing expenses.

There shall be no monthly usage charge for sanitary sewer services provided to single-family residences for water usage as measured by the water meter in excess of eighteen thousand (18,000) gallons per month. 
(4)  Minimum monthly sewer usage charges for multiple dwellings or businesses using a common or master water meter. Where master water meters serve more than one family, such as duplexes, triplexes, apartment complexes, manufactured home parks, recreational vehicle (RV) parks or in commercial buildings serving more than one business, each individual residence, apartment, mobile home pad, RV pad or business shall be subject to the minimum monthly sewer usage charge as specified in the schedule below or the actual usage recorded on the meter, whichever amount is greater. The minimum monthly sewer usage charge is calculated based on the number of dwelling or business units multiplied by the master metered minimum monthly sewer usage charge per unit as specified in the schedule below. The actual usage, divided by one thousand (1,000), is multiplied by the effective rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water usage. Under this provision, the minimum monthly sewer usage charge for efficiency and one bedroom apartments that are master metered shall be calculated by taking the total number of efficiency and one-bedroom apartments divided by two (2) and rounded up to the next whole number. An example calculation is as follows: the minimum monthly sewer usage charge for an apartment complex with a common or master water meter serving seven (7) one-bedroom apartments will be based on four (4) units [which is seven (7) one-bedroom apartments divided by two (2), which equals three and one half (3.5), which is rounded up to four (4)] multiplied by the minimum bill per unit as specified in the schedule below or the actual usage reflected on the common or master water meter divided by one thousand (1,000) multiplied by the effective sewer rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons, whichever is greater. Under this provision, the minimum monthly sewer usage charge for apartments larger than one bedroom, manufactured home pads, RV pads or businesses that are master metered shall be the number of units multiplied by the master metered minimum monthly sewer usage charge per unit as specified in the schedule below or the actual usage reflected on the common or master water meter divided by one thousand (1,000) multiplied by the effective sewer rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons, whichever is greater. The minimum monthly sewer usage charge for master-metered users shall be as follows:

(5)  Late fees assessed for failure to pay by the due date. For any total account balance, including water, sewer, or solid waste services billed, that has not been paid by the date due, a rate of five (5) per cent of the delinquent account balance, with a minimum late fee of five dollars ($5.00), will be added to the account. 
(b)  Sewer system access fees. The city shall levy a sewer system access fee for each property that is developed and connected to the city sanitary sewer system. The purpose of the sewer system access fee is to finance the cost of the sanitary sewer system capacity necessary to serve each property that is connected to the city sanitary sewer system. 
(1)  Sewer system access fee rates. Except as provided in subparagraph (3) below, sanitary sewer system access fees for residential and commercial customers shall be based upon the size of the water meter installed on the property being developed, regardless of the water service provider. Sewer system access fees shall be levied as follows: 
Meter Size Effective 
April 1, 2010 3/4 $1,800.00 1" 4,500.00 11/2" 9,000.00 2" 14,400.00 3" 28,800.00 4" 45,000.00 6" 90,000.00 8-10" 144,000.00  
(2)  Sewer system access fee due date. The sewer system access fee shall be determined by the water resource management department following review of the site development and construction plans. The sewer system access fee shall be paid to the utility billing office of the finance department prior to the issuance of the building permit for the development. If the owner or developer of a parcel for which a sewer system access fee is due, but unpaid, begins construction activities on the parcel prior to payment of the sewer system access fee, the city manager or his designee shall take the necessary action to halt such construction activities. 
(3)  Sewer system access fees for master-metered residential developments. Sewer system access fees for master-metered residential developments including, but not limited to, multi-family developments, RV parks and manufactured home parks shall be levied on a "per dwelling unit" basis; that is, the sewer system access fee for a master-metered residential development shall be calculated by multiplying the number of dwelling units in a multi-family development or the number of spaces/pads in an RV or manufactured home park by the sewer system access fee in effect for a 3/4-inch meter. 
(4)  Sewer system access fee credits for redevelopment. Where a previously developed property is redeveloped or modified, a credit for the existing meter(s) or number of dwelling units shall be applied to the sewer system access fee due and payable at the time of redevelopment. These credits shall be calculated using the methodology outlined in the city water works board's methodology to be used for the collection of residential and commercial water access fees resolution dated May 21, 2009. 
(c)  Sewer account security deposits. In order to secure the city's charges for sanitary sewer system services, a security deposit shall be required to be paid by each property owner or lessee for each service address to which city sanitary sewer services are provided or available.

CITY OF AUBURN ZONING ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE in pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Chapter 52, Articles 1 through 4
inclusive, of the 1975 Code of Alabama, to provide the establishment of districts within the corporate limits
of the City of Auburn, Alabama; to regulate within such districts the height, number of stories and size of
buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards and other open
spaces, the density of population and the use of buildings, structures, and land; to repeal all existing Zoning
Ordinances and to provide methods of administration of this Ordinance and penalties for the violation
thereof.
THE PUBLIC WELFARE REQUIRING IT, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Auburn, as
follows:
ARTICLE I. TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION.
Section 100. Title.
This Ordinance shall be known as and may be referred to as the Auburn Zoning Ordinance, and includes
maps of the City that depict the boundaries of zoning districts.
Section 101. Legislative Intent.
In enacting the Zoning Ordinance, special notice has been taken of the fact that the goals of citizens and
landowners of Auburn often conflict or compete. In the light of this situation, the first consideration has
been to devise technical solutions, which minimize or eliminate conflicts.
This Ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate both competing interests. This has
inevitably, and properly, led to some form of compromise. In arriving at these compromises, every
possible consideration has been given to the public interest, individual property rights, and externalities.
While compromise implies mutual concessions or losses, it also implies  and this Ordinance has been
designed to provide  mutual gains and benefits. It is the goal of this Ordinance that both the burdens and
the benefits it implies are rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of
Auburn.
Every effort has been made to make uses a matter of right subject to performance criteria capable of
nondiscretionary, objective administrative evaluations, thus reducing the number of times that rezoning
decisions need be made. This greatly increases the potential uses or choices available to individual
property owners. The rezoning decisions that conventional zoning ordinances frequently necessitate appear
to reduce the certainty of protection to neighbors and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to
Auburn. This Ordinance contains performance criteria intended to insure that neighbors are protected from
adverse impacts. The Ordinance also contains performance criteria to protect the communitys general
welfare. Zoning districts are few in number, and each has a clearly different purpose. Distinctions among
zoning districts are based upon the Citys Comprehensive Plan. The districts are sized to be adequate to
handle Auburns long-term needs and must be regularly updated as time passes. Where performance
criteria severely limit the use of properties, the Ordinance has gone to considerable extremes to provide the
landowners with a range of choices, flexibility, and options for development.
Section 102. Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance is the promotion of the health, safety, and general welfare of the present and
future inhabitants of Auburn by:
I-1
102.01. Giving effect to the policies and proposals set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan.
102.02. Providing methods to preserve and maintain a healthful environment for the benefit of
present and future generations by providing standards to control the amount of open
space and impervious surfaces within a development; to control the intensity of
development in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to reduce
or eliminate adverse environmental impacts.
102.03. Controlling and regulating the growth of Auburn, concentrating development in areas
where adequate sewerage facilities, roads, and schools can be provided, and limiting
development in areas where these facilities are not and should not be provided.
102.04. Regulating and restricting the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade,
industry, residences, and other uses.
102.05. Providing standards for all types of dwelling units so that all the people may have access
to decent, sound, and sanitary housing in accordance with the goals of the Federal
Housing Act of 1949, among which is the provision of adequate zoning to meet a fair
share of the regions housing needs.
102.06. Lessening the danger of congestion of traffic on the roads and highways, limiting
excessive numbers of intersections, driveways, and other friction points, minimizing
other hazards, and insuring the continued usefulness of all elements of the existing
highway system for their planned function.
102.07. Securing safety from fire, panic, flood, and other dangers.
102.08. Providing adequate privacy, light, and air.
102.09. Securing economy in local governmental expenditures.
102.10. Conserving property values throughout Auburn.
102.11. Protecting landowners from adverse impacts of adjoining developments.
102.12. Dividing the incorporated area of Auburn into districts according to the use of land and
buildings, the intensity of such uses (including bulk and height), and surrounding open
space.
Each purpose listed above serves to balance the interest of the general public of Auburn and those of
individual property owners.
Section 103. Jurisdiction.
This Ordinance shall apply to all areas within the corporate limits of the City of Auburn, Alabama. No
building or land shall hereafter be used, and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved, or altered
unless for a use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the
district in which it is located, except as herein provided.
Section 104. Interpretation and Purpose
In their interpretation and application the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered the minimum
requirements to promote and preserve the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and
general welfare of the community. Where other ordinances or regulations impose greater restrictions than
I-2
those specified in this Ordinance, compliance with such other ordinances and regulations shall be
mandatory.
Application of the provisions of this Ordinance shall not lower the restrictions of plats, deeds, or private
contracts if such are greater than the provisions of this Ordinance.
The provisions of this Ordinance are not intended to abrogate, annul, or otherwise interfere with any
easement, covenant, or private agreement; provided, however, that where the provisions of this Ordinance
are more restrictive or impose higher standards the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply.
Section 105. Severability
If any section, clause, or provision of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision or portion
of this Ordinance which is not in and of itself invalid or unconstitutional.
Section 106. Effective Date
This Ordinance shall become effective upon its adoption, approval, and publication as required by law, and
shall be codified in the Code of Auburn, Alabama; and upon such date all zoning ordinances heretofore
adopted shall be and are hereby repealed.

Section 304. Statement of Purpose and Intent of Zoning Districts.
The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance.
304.01. Urban Core District (UC). This District is intended to serve as the retail, financial, service,
historical and religious focal point of Auburn. In general, the UC provides for uses of regional, as well as
local, importance. It is intended to be an area of high intensity use in which a full range of public facilities
are available. Approval of proposals/applications may require collaboration between the City and
developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as parking, additional street
and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement of the street environment.
Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged.
Occupancy in the UC is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.02 College Edge Overlay District (CEOD). This District provides additional regulations for properties
within Urban Core zoning along the College/Magnolia corridors* for purposes of assuring development
consistency in meeting building requirements for setback, step back, glazing, cladding materials, signage,
balconies, awnings, and canopies.
*Parcels fronting on College Street between Thach Avenue and Mitcham Avenue, as well as parcels fronting
on Magnolia from Wright Street to Gay Street will be included in the CEOD.
304.03. Urban Neighborhood East (UN-E). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at
medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and
to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of a wide range of residential, commercial, and
institutional uses adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-E District is a development and
redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with
permitted uses to serve a broad range of community needs.
The nature of the UN-E District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District,
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by
the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as
parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement
of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged.
Occupancy in the UN-E is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.04. University Neighborhood West (UN-W). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use
at high densities to meet the demands exerted by Auburn University, and to accommodate the conversion,
redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses adjacent to the University
campus and the urban core of the City of Auburn. The UN-W District is a development and redevelopment
District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable character with permitted uses
which serve a range of student and community needs.
The nature of the UN-W District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District,
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by
the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as
III-3
parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement
of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged.
Occupancy in the UN-Wis limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.05. Urban Neighborhood South (UN-S). This District is intended to provide for mixed land use at
medium to higher densities to meet the demands exerted by downtown Auburn and Auburn University and
to promote the conversion, redevelopment, and growth of residential, commercial, and institutional uses
adjacent to the urban core of the City of Auburn and the University campus. The UN-S District is a
development and redevelopment District with development regulations that promote a more urban, walkable
character. Of the three (3) Urban Neighborhood Districts, the permitted uses in this District are geared to the
community as a whole, but focused on preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family
residential areas adjacent to this District.
The nature of the UN-S District, and the intent of the City to promote redevelopment within the District,
requires that the more stringent review of proposals and the greatest commitment to capital improvements by
the City be undertaken in this District. Approval of proposals/applications may require a collaboration
between the City and developers/owners for the planning and provision of public improvements such as
parking, additional street and utility rights-of-way, and implementation of public plans for the improvement
of the street environment. Innovation and professionalism in quality urban design is strongly encouraged.
Occupancy in the UN-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.06 Neighborhood Conservation District (NC). The Neighborhood Conservation (NC) District is
intended to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods and developments under construction at the time
of adoption of this Ordinance. It is designed to prevent these neighborhoods and subdivisions from becoming
nonconforming under the terms of this Ordinance. This District is also intended to provide for future
development of land where a NC District is deemed the most appropriate zoning classification, and a
preliminary or final plat for development of the land has been approved by the Planning Commission. It is
also intended to provide for in-filling of existing neighborhoods on vacant lots with single family detached
dwellings as defined in Section 203 of this Ordinance.
Because there are a number of different lot sizes in the Neighborhood Conservation District, the Zoning Map
depicts these various areas with the letters NC sub-designated by a number. The number indicates the
minimum lot size in thousands of square feet. For example, NC-20 indicates that 20,000 square feet is the
minimum lot size for the District so designated.
Occupancy in NC zones is limited to the Family as per Section 203.
304.07 Development District Housing (DDH). The Development District  Housing (DDH) is a District
that is designed to promote conventional and performance single family housing and/or provide a transition
between the NC and the CDD. Permitted uses in this District will be limited to conventional residential uses
of low to moderate densities, outdoor recreation uses, and public service uses. Performance residential uses
are permitted conditionally. At the time of enactment of this Ordinance, the DDH consisted largely of vacant
or undeveloped land, but it is the intent of this Ordinance that this District have a residential character.
Occupancy in the DDH is limited to the Family as per Section 203.
304.08 Medium Density Residential District (MDRD). The Medium Density Residential District (MDRD)
is a District that is designed to promote redevelopment of residential properties to provide more diverse
housing types at higher densities than the DDH district. The district is intended to provide a transition
between the DDH and the UN and CRD districts. Permitted uses will be limited to performance residential
housing types, and limited institutional, special residential, and public service uses.
III-4
Occupancy in the MDRD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by
standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses
304.09 Neighborhood Redevelopment District (NRD). The Neighborhood Redevelopment District is
designed to promote infill and renewal of existing neighborhoods by allowing a variety of residential uses
while preserving and complimenting the character of the single-family residential areas adjacent to this
District. Permitted uses include conventional and most performance residential uses with the intention of
accommodating moderate densities and providing a transition between CRD-W and NC.
Occupancy in the NRD, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the Family as per Section 203.
Occupancy in the NRD, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as
otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.10 Redevelopment District (RDD). This District is intended to promote the renewal of those
transitional areas of the City of Auburn that have undergone extensive changes in land use type and
density/intensity. Transition from generally low density residential land use to higher residential densities
and small-scale commercial, office and institutional use has occurred in a haphazard manner, much of it prior
to enactment of current zoning regulations. This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of
an urban character. It provides for intermediate residential densities and necessary commercial and
institutional uses.
The RDD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and
public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize transitional neighborhoods,
thereby reducing the cost of growth in Auburn. The RDD may not accommodate a substantially larger
population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected
to improve immensely. Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on
minimizing or buffering any nuisances between uses. This Ordinance, therefore, imposes standards to resolve
any possible problems and eliminate negative impacts.
Occupancy in the RDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.11 Rural District (R). This District is intended to protect and preserve areas of Auburn which are
presently rural or agricultural in character and use.
The standards developed for these areas are designed to permit development compatible with the preservation
of their rural character and agricultural use, while not permanently foreclosing future development.
304.12 Limited Development District (LDD). The Limited Development District (LDD) is intended to
accommodate mainly low to moderate density residential development, supported by commercial uses
serving the local residents. Such commercial uses will be limited in range, scale and location; and will be
subject to design standards intended to promote low-intensity commercial development that is consistent in
character and appearance with surrounding residential areas.
Occupancy in the LDD is limited to the Family as per Section 203.
304.13 Comprehensive Development District (CDD). This District is intended to accommodate most of
the growth expected in the undeveloped areas of Auburn. It is to be provided with all public facilities
(schools, sewers, water, and highways) and will allow most uses by right. It is intended to provide the zoning
and capital improvements that attract development. It consists of the areas where development should
logically locate as a consequence of planned public facilities and associated capital expenditures. This
District provides regulations that permit development of both urban and suburban character. It provides for
low- to moderate-density residential development and for necessary commercial and institutional uses.
III-5
The CDD is designed to minimize the costs of extending or expanding public services. It is a planned, logical
accommodation of growth and is intended to serve areas suitable for development and to avoid unsuitable
areas. Uses that are so large as to be of regional importance are not permitted by right, because these uses
require specialized and different evaluation and have special locational considerations, which may make a
separate zoning district appropriate. Major uses, such as a regional shopping center, will be considered as
conditional uses. Manufactured home parks, commercial support uses, and road service uses are permitted
conditionally, and industrial uses are not permitted.
The CDD allows many and varied uses while placing the emphasis on minimizing or buffering any nuisances
between uses. Segregation of uses has never provided adequate protection, especially at the boundaries of
use districts. This Ordinance anticipates the likelihood  and desirability  of considerable mixing of land
uses and imposes standards to resolve any possible problems and eliminate the negative impacts of
juxtaposing unlike land uses.
Occupancy in the CDD is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise provided by standards
for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.14. Corridor Redevelopment District (CRD). This District is intended to promote the renewal of the
traditional auto-oriented commercial corridors of the City of Auburn. The areas with this designation were
developed prior to the current zoning regulations and suffer from poor aesthetics and lack of economic
diversity. This District provides regulations that permit redevelopment of a more urban or mixed-use
character while protecting the economic viability of the corridor. It provides for intermediate residential
densities and necessary commercial and institutional uses.
The CRD is designed to target areas where a combination of public investment in capital improvements and
public/private actions to renew and redevelop land and structures will stabilize commercial corridors, thereby
reducing the cost of growth in Auburn. The CRD is not intended to accommodate a substantially larger
population as a result of redevelopment, but the character, stability and vitality of the District are projected
to improve. Like the CDD, this District allows many and varied uses while placing emphasis on minimizing
or buffering any nuisances between uses. This zone, therefore, imposes standards to alleviate conflicts and
eliminate negative impacts.
The CRD is divided into four unique sub-districts: Corridor Redevelopment District - Urban (CRD-U),
Corridor Redevelopment District  East (CRD-E), Corridor Redevelopment District  Suburban (CRD-S),
and Corridor Redevelopment District  West (CRD-W). The Urban and East designations promotes more
compact growth in those areas closer to the Urban Core. The Suburban and West designations promotes
growth with strong aesthetic and increased design guidance.
Occupancy in the CRD-U, CRD-E and CRD-S is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except as otherwise
provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses
Occupancy in the CRD-W, west of North Donahue Drive, is limited to the Family as per Section 203.
Occupancy in the CRD-W, east of North Donahue Drive, is limited to five (5) unrelated individuals, except
as otherwise provided by standards for Institutional and Special Residential Uses.
304.15 South College Corridor District (SCCD). This District is intended to accommodate commercial,
entertainment, and services uses that not only serve the local community but also the greater region due to
the proximity to the interstate highway. The district is provided with public facilities (sewer, water, and
highways) and will allow most commercial uses by right. This District is not intended to accommodate
residential or industrial uses. The District is intended to provide zoning and capital improvement that attract
development that provides goods and services to a broad market beyond the community.
The SCDD is designed to accommodate growth of commercial uses that require a higher need of access and
visibility for the regional shopping and hospitality markets. In addition to the commercial uses that are
III-6
permitted by right, road service uses that are geared toward a retail consumer are permitted, whereas, most
other road service uses are considered as conditional uses.
Since the SCDD is a primarily commercial use district, there is less need for minimizing impacts and
nuisances within the district and more emphasis on access and circulation between properties and uses.
304.16. Industrial District (I). This District is intended to accommodate industrial areas that must be
segregated, because of negative impacts that cannot be made compatible with other uses through the
application of performance standards. The creation of this separate District for industrial use recognizes not
only nuisances, but also infrastructure and operational incompatibilities between its permitted uses and those
of other districts. Accordingly, the standards for this District are designed to accommodate intensive
industrial uses that generate nuisances, which either cannot be handled by technology or which are nearly
impossible to police. Locational criteria for this district focus on transportation, requiring that sites have
access to a railroad, an airport or a major expressway.
304.17 Planned Development District (PDD). This District is intended to provide an opportunity for a land
development process with the greatest flexibility available to the developer, consistent with the provisions of
these regulations, and the provisions included in the master development plan for the subject property. The
PDD designation may be requested and considered for application only to those properties already zoned
DDH, MDRD, NRD, CDD, LDD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD.
Approval of a Planned Development District (PDD) shall be based upon the approval of a master
development plan (Section 505) for the site in question. The approved master development plan shall
establish the allowable uses, densities, street and building configuration, open space, amenities and buffering.
Uses shall be selected from those listed conditionally in Table 4-1 following a thorough evaluation of the
propose location of any PDD. Following the acceptance of the master development plan, the property shall
receive the PDD zoning designation.
304.18. Conservation Overlay District (COD). This District is intended to promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public by encouraging the conservation and enhancement of the Citys source of water
supply and natural resource environment. The purposes of the district are:
1. To protect water quality in the Lake Ogletree Subwatershed;
2. To permanently preserve unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater,
floodplains, wetlands, streams, and woodlands within the City of Auburn;
3. To offer developers and landowners alternatives to standard development of land;
4. To provide flexibility to allow for creativity in development;
5. To foster less sprawl and more efficient use of land, streets, and utilities; and
6. To permit clustering of buildings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils in
order to reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility
easements, necessary for residential and commercial development.
304.19. Holding District (HD). This District encompasses those land which are owned or operated by
governmental entities and are exempt from the regulations of this code and those lands which are set aside
for public institutional uses and the protection of vital natural resources. The purpose of the Holding District
in relation to government-owned lands is to acknowledge their presence within the City Limits while
recognizing that such areas are not subject to local zoning requirements. If and when any HD-designated
property comes under private ownership, the Planning Commission shall assign the appropriate zoning
designation.
ARTICLE IV. GENERAL REGULATIONS
Section 400. Introduction.
The purpose of the regulations contained in this Article is to allow maximum utilization of land while insuring against
detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public interest. This insurance is provided
by separating the incorporated area of the City of Auburn into 19 zoning districts and permitting specified land uses
within each, provided that a use meets all the additional criteria specified in this Ordinance. This regulatory approach
has been termed performance zoning, because it permits a use to be developed on a particular parcel only if that use
meets performance standards, which have been enacted to insure against the use causing, or having the potential to
cause, the negative impacts mentioned above.
The format of the regulations in this Ordinance, and particularly in this Article, differs somewhat from that of
traditional zoning ordinances, because performance zoning requires that consideration be given to site parcel
characteristics and the range of impacts that any land use may have.
Section 401. Use Regulations. Section 402 through 407 identify the category of use and define the specific uses
shown in Table 4-1 - Table of Permitted Uses. Section 408 and Table 4-1 indicate which land uses may locate by
right, by conditional use, or are not permitted in each zoning district. In addition, Section 408 provides special
developments standards for uses that are permitted or conditional permitted in each zoning district.
Section 402. Use Categories Defined. The categories of uses utilized by this Ordinance are defined in Sections 403
through 407. The uses not enumerated in these sections are not necessarily excluded. Article IX empowers the
Planning Director to make interpretations of use.
Section 403. Agricultural Uses.
403.01 Agriculture. Agricultural uses include farms (and farm residences); fish or poultry hatcheries; fur-bearing
animal ranches; orchards; raising of livestock, horses, or poultry; truck farming; and all other agricultural uses. It does

that support or are supported by agriculture.
403.02. Forestry. This use includes commercial logging and pulping operations, clearing or destruction of forested
or woodland areas, selective cutting or clearing for commercial or other purposes, clearing for agriculture or other
prospective land uses, and clearing of vegetation in reserved open space or resource protection areas. This does not
include authorized clearing in accordance with plans approved pursuant to this Ordinance, removal of sick or dead
trees, or removal of trees on lots of one (1) acre or less.
Section 404. Residential Uses.
404.01. Conventional residential. Conventional residential uses consist of all single-family detached dwelling units.

requirements of Section 502.01.
404.02. Performance residential. Performance residential uses consist of all residential developments, including
manufactured home parks approved after enactment of this Ordinance, except those included within the conventional

uses. These uses are all supportive of the residential community. They provide indoor space for recreation, hobbies,
meetings, education, and worship, as well as cultural facilities, group quarters for religious groups and the infirm or
elderly. Some uses may be operated for private profit.
Section 406 Commercial Uses.
406.01. Office. Office uses include governmental offices, business or professional offices, medical offices or clinics,
and all other office uses.

(including miniature golf), outdoor theaters (or amphitheaters), race tracks (e.g., auto, dog, go-kart, harness, horse,
motorcycle), archery ranges, sport arenas, stadiums, and all other commercial recreation uses. This group includes
recreational uses that are greater nuisances than conventional outdoor recreational activities, because of their size and
scale, traffic volumes, noise, light, or physical hazards such as flying objects or use of weapons.
406.05. Recreational rental dwelling uses. These uses include travel trailer parks, recreational vehicle parks, camps
or campgrounds with overnight camping or vacation cottages, rental cabins, vacation cottages, and all other

(feed, grain, fertilizer), farm product processing (cidermill, dairies, poultry, or meat processing), and all other
agricultural support uses.
406.08. Nurseries. This category includes nurseries with or without retail sales or greenhouses. A nursery is basically
an open-space use, which generates little traffic and has few nuisances such as late hours or customer or truck noise
associated with it. Nurseries are distinguished from more intensive garden center uses.
406.09. Commercial support. This use category includes uses, which support the Citys retail economy by providing
merchandise distribution, storage, and repair services. These uses include beverage distributors; blacksmith shops;
bulk materials or machinery storage (fully enclosed); large equipment rental/sales/service; contractors offices and
equipment storage yards; dry cleaning and laundry plants serving more than one (1) outlet; fuel, oil, ice, coal, and

406.10. Neighborhood Shopping Center. A commercial development site containing one or more commercial
buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs, drainage facilities, and other design
features to accommodate the uses permitted on the site. The purpose of the neighborhood shopping center is to serve
the limited commercial needs of nearby residential development. It is not intended to provide commercial services to
customers from other areas of the City.
Permitted uses shall include banks; garden supply stores; grocery stores or supermarkets; ice cream stores; laundries
and/or dry cleaners; light mechanical repairs such as cameras, watches, or tvs; barber or beauty shops; standard sitdown
restaurants, not fast food establishments; gasoline service stations; and similar retail stores and service
businesses.

containing one or more commercial buildings, together with all required parking, landscaping, buffering, signs,
drainage facilities, and other design features, to accommodate the uses permitted on the site. The purpose of the
community shopping center is to serve a larger market area than a neighborhood shopping center with certain
categories of commodities that are less likely found in a regional shopping center, such as garden and building
supplies.
Permitted uses shall include office; garden supply stores; grocery stores; clothing stores; specialty food stores; dry
cleaners; electronic repairs such as cameras, watches, or televisions; barber or beauty shops; standard sit-down
restaurants; and similar retail stores and service businesses. (See Table 4-1).

Section 803).
406.12. Regional shopping center. This category includes commercial land development consisting of 500,000 or
more square feet of gross floor area on one (1) lot.

facilities; truck, motor, or rail terminals; dyeing plants; food processing and packing plants; lumber yards; pilot plants;
scientific (e.g., research, testing, or experimental) laboratories; also, those uses listed above as commercial support,
any industrial use having 30,000 or more square feet of floor area or having 100 or more employees on any shift, and
all other industrial uses.
IV-3
This group contains uses that have severe potential for negative impact on any uses that would locate relatively close
to them. This group differs from commercial support uses in that it includes uses that require enclosed structures,
which are large, tall, and unsightly, such as concrete batching plants. These uses also have severe potential for
generation of odor and may involve large amounts of exterior storage; because of their scale, they are likely to have a
regional impact.
407.02. Extraction and junkyard uses. This category includes junk, scrap, or salvage yards and all extraction uses.
These uses create major disruptions to the areas environment, even when carefully regulated. Dust, dirt, noise, and
unsightly conditions can be anticipated. None of these areas is an acceptable neighbor in an urban environment.
407.03. Airports, Landing Strips and Heliports. This category includes any facility used for take-off, landing,
storage, maintenance, and/or repair of aircraft. It also includes aviation-related activities, such as radar and
communications facilities, flight schools, and cargo loading and storage areas. (Also see Section 516 Airport Overlay
District)
Section 408. Uses Permitted by Right, Uses Permitted with Conditional Use Permits, and Uses Not Permitted.
Except as otherwise provided by law or in this Ordinance, no building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied
except in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in this Section. The general use categories
specified by Table 4-1 are defined in Sections 403 through 407.
Uses permitted by right or as a conditional use shall be subject, in addition, to use regulations contained in this
Ordinance, to all performance criteria, and other regulations governing yards, lot size, lot width, building area,
easements, provisions of off-street parking and loading, and to such other provisions as are specified in other Articles
herein. In particular, the laws of the State of Alabama and the regulations of the Lee County Department of Health
regarding water supply and waste disposal shall be adhered to. Further, no permits shall be issued until approval is
obtained from the Lee County Department of Health for water supply and sewage disposal, unless the premises are
served by public water and/or sewage facilities.
408.01. All permitted uses and uses requiring conditional use approval pursuant to Section 803 are listed in Table 4-
1. In addition, the table notes uses for which special development standards apply, regardless of whether such uses
are designated as permitted or conditional. Special development standards are listed in Section 408.02.
A use listed in Table 4-1 in any district denoted by the letter P is a use permitted by right, provided that all other
requirements of State law and this Ordinance have been met and provided that a zoning certificate has been issued in
accordance with Article IX. A use listed in Table 4-1 may be permitted as a conditional use in any district denoted
by the letter C, provided that the requirements of Article VIII have been met.

Section 409. Zoning District Performance Standards. Sections 417 and 418 delineate the standards for open space,
density, impervious surface coverage, and lot area that apply in each zoning district. The purpose of these performance
standards is to provide detailed regulations and restrictions by means of minimum criteria, which must be met in order
to protect neighbors from adverse impacts of proposed land uses and to protect the general health, safety and welfare
by limiting where uses may be established, insuring that traffic congestion is minimized, controlling the intensity of
use, and prescribing other such performance criteria as necessary to implement the goals and objectives of this
Ordinance. This Ordinance depends on a comprehensive performance evaluation process to insure compatibility
between neighboring land uses.
Section 410. Compliance. All uses and activities shall comply fully with the provisions of the following standards
as a precondition of development approval.
Section 411. Performance Standards. This section contains the basic standards applicable to the districts and uses
allowed by this Ordinance. The standards of Tables 4-2 and 4-3 shall apply to each district and use therein. All
standards must be met.
Some development standards shown in Tables 4-2 and 4-3, particularly maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and
impervious surface ratio (ISR), may differ from standards provided in Table 4-4 or elsewhere in this Ordinance; in all
cases, the strictest standard shall apply.
All tracts of land within a district may be developed to the same density factor. However, the number of units
permitted per gross acre will vary from site to site due to differences in the amounts of resource protection land, but
will in no case exceed the maximum gross density established in Table 4-2.
The floor area ratio is the maximum amount of gross floor area of all floors of a building permitted on the site.
Impervious surface ratios are calculated separately for areas and/or parts of a development site that are separated by a
public road, railroad, or other feature that affects surface drainage.
The base-zoning district from which they were rezoned shall govern densities, and open space ratios for uses in
Planned Development Districts. When a Planned Development District encompasses property with more than one
original zoning designation, the density, and open space ratio shall be derived from the calculated average figure based
on the acreage within each original zoning designation. This average may be applied across the overall site, without
regard for the original designation.
411.01. Building Setbacks.
A. Minimum Setbacks. To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure adequate light, air and privacy
to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed building by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the
zoning district as shown in Table 4-3 below.
The product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the property line. If, based on this
calculation, the setback required is greater than the minimum width of the required bufferyard, the setback according
to the angle of light exposure factor must be used.
B. Maximum Setbacks. Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply to the frontage upon any
designated corridor (Section 429). For corner properties, the maximum setback shall be measured from the property
line of both rights-of-way. This setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements.
IV-30
Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events shall be allowed under the
requirements of this section following the review and approval of the Planning Commission. Such recesses shall be
clearly illustrated on the site plan.

Section 412. Natural Resource Protection Standards.
A. All residential and nonresidential development shall be preceded by the identification of any
environmental or natural feature described in Sections 413 through 416 and shall meet the specified
standards of environmental protection.
B. Site alterations, regrading, filling and clearing or planting vegetation prior to approval of the
subdivision plats and/or site plans for development shall be a violation of this Ordinance. Reference
in this section to open space is intended to mean the term as it is defined by Article II and described
in Section 417.
Section 413. Stream Buffer.
413.01. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of
buffers to ensure that the stream and adjacent land will fulfill their natural functions; to reduce land development
impacts on stream water quality and flows; and to provide for the environmentally sound use of Auburns land
resources.
413.02. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following words or phrases shall be defined as specified
below.
A. Perennial stream: See Article II, DefinitionsStream, Perennial
B. Intermittent stream: A stream that flows at least six months out of a year but does not flow during
part or all of the summer and may carry water during or after a rainstorm.
C. Ephemeral stream: A stream channel or reach of stream channel that carries surface water runoff
for short durations as a result of precipitation events. The channel bottom is always above the
groundwater table.
D. Best Management Practices (BMPs): Conservation practices or management measures that control
soil loss and reduce water quality degradation caused by nutrients, animal wastes, toxics, sediment,
and runoff.
413.03. Streams Determination. Perennial and intermittent streams are identified through site inspection by the
Water Resource Management Department and/or US Geological Survey (USGS) maps. Perennial streams are those
which are normally depicted on a USGS map with a solid blue line. Intermittent streams are normally depicted on a
USGS map with a dotted blue line. Perennial and intermittent streams not identified on the USGS map as described
herein may be added to a development site plan by the Water Resource Management Department based on the
determination by a qualified professional that the stream satisfies the USGS definition for said streams. Ephemeral
streams are streams assessed and determined by the Water Resource Management Department through stream
delineation done on the development site as reported by a qualified professional.
413.04. Buffer description, width, and permitted uses. Stream buffers shall be required on each side of all
perennial and intermittent streams as defined in Section 413.02 and further described in Section 413.03. Stream
buffers width shall vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin. Table 4.31 specifies the buffer required
based on the drainage area for a particular stream above the most downstream point on the development being
considered. The USGS 7.5 minute 1:2000 quadrangle maps, in conjunction with the Soil Survey Maps of Lee
County and the City of Auburn Geographic Information System (GIS), will serve as tools to delineate the size of
drainage basins and specify the corresponding buffer width.
The stream buffer is comprised of three zones: Streamside Zone, Managed Use Zone, and Upland Zone. Buffer zones
function, vegetation and permitted uses vary by zone as described in the Table 4.32.

If an ephemeral stream remains after construction has been completed, and all or a portion of that stream falls within
the stream buffer of an intermittent or perennial stream, then that ephemeral stream shall be revegetated on both sides
of the stream in accordance with the targeted vegetation of the corresponding buffer zone. Appropriate stream bank
stabilization measures shall be designed if warranted by excessive velocities in the ephemeral stream. If the ephemeral
stream remains after construction and falls outside of an intermittent/perennial stream buffer, then that ephemeral
stream shall be grassed and/or revegetated in accordance with the surrounding vegetation at a width of 25 feet on each
side of the ephemeral stream. Ephemeral stream channels and banks shall be stabilized as appropriate for the predicted
stream velocities. These measures are performed in order to preserve and protect water quality.

*As deemed necessary and approved by the Water Resource Management Department
413.05. Applicability. The buffer requirements shall apply to all perennial and intermittent streams defined in
Section 413.02. Buffer widths for streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water,
landward from the top of the bank on each side of the stream. The top of bank is the landward edge of the stream
channel during high water or bank full conditions at the point where the water leaves the stream channel and begins
to overflow onto the floodplain.
IV-37
All properties shall be subject to the buffer width requirements except those properties that are an existing lot of record
and/or included on an approved preliminary subdivision plat and the lot or lots cannot meet the requirements described
in this Section. (Effective date 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389)
413.06. Minimize Intrusion. Any uses allowed in Table 4.32 shall be designed and constructed to minimize the
amount of intrusion into the stream buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion, and water quality degradation.
413.07. Land in the Stream Buffer. Land in stream buffers shall not be used for principal structures. All new
platted lots shall be designed to provide sufficient land outside of the stream buffer to accommodate primary structures.
Stream buffers should be delineated before streets and lots are laid out to minimize buffer intrusion and to assure
adequate buildable area on each platted lot.
Land within the stream buffer can serve to meet the minimum lot size requirements.
413.08. Setback Requirements. For all lots within a development requiring a stream buffer, setbacks can be 100%
within the stream buffer.
413.09. Buffer Impact. When the application of the buffer zones would result in the loss of buildable area on a lot
(See Section 203 for definition of lot) that was recorded prior to the amendment of this ordinance, modifying the
width of the buffer zones may be allowed, through an administrative process, as determined by the Water Resource
Management Department.
Modification and mitigation of the stream buffer width are also available to landowners or developers of newly platted
lots or subdivisions where there are exceptional situations or physical conditions on the parcel that pose practical
difficulty to its development and restrict the application of the regulations of this ordinance. There must be proof of
such circumstances by the landowner.
The landowner or his designated representative proposing any of the impacts shall prepare and submit for approval a
written request and a site plan showing the extent of the proposed impact and must specify a proposed mitigation
technique. Mitigation techniques are included in Section 413.10.
The Water Resource Management Department and other appropriate city staff members shall review and render a
decision on any buffer encroachment and mitigation technique with regard to the stream buffer requirements.
Amendment to the stream buffer width may be allowed in accordance with the following criteria:
A. The proposed encroachment and mitigation is in accordance with the purpose and intent of this
section of the ordinance.
B. The proposed lot and structure conforms to all other zoning and development regulations.
C. Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable
buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utility.
D. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable written statement justifying
the need for the buffer impact.
E. The landowner or his designated representative submitted an acceptable mitigation plan in
accordance with cited mitigation techniques.
F. Attention has been given to maintaining natural vegetation and eliminating run-off.
In no case shall the reduced portion of the buffer area be less than the width of the Streamside Zone (25 feet).
IV-38
413.10. Stream Buffer Mitigation Techniques. The following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation
of buffer impact.
A. Installation of Structural BMPs. The installation of an on-site structural BMP (i.e. bioretention,
extended detention/retention, rain gardens, stormwater wetlands, etc.) will allow for stream buffer
impacts on the specific site. The structural BMP shall be designed to achieve pollutant (nutrients,
herbicides, pesticides, sediment and other illicit discharges) removal to the maximum extent
practicable. The BMP shall remain outside the Streamside Zone. A detailed BMP design plan must
be submitted to the Water Resource Management Department for approval along with a long-term
maintenance plan.
B. Controlled Impervious Surface. The landowner may commit to and provide a specific site
development plan that limits the overall site impervious surface ratio equal to or less than 25%.
C. Open Space Development. The landowner may submit a specific site development plan which
preserves an undisturbed, vegetative area on-site or near the development site as open space equal
to 200% of the buffer encroachment area. The open space preserved must promote water quality
protection.
D. Stream Restoration: The landowner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of
equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of which is determined to be qualified for
restoration by the Water Resource Management Department on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream.
This restoration shall include stream bank improvements and Streamside and Managed Use Zone
re-vegetation.
E. Stream Preservation: The landowner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments within the
city limits at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple and
absolute title of the land to the City.
F. Wetland Restoration: On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (2 acres of wetland
for each acre of disturbed area), the landowner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or
restoration of wetlands with protective easements, and the implementation of structural or nonstructural
BMPs to achieve pollutant removal to the maximum extent practicable.
G. Greenways: The landowner may allocate and donate open space within the city limits through fee
simple to the City of Auburn for preservation and use as common open space.
H. Wider Buffer Widths: A developer may add additional widths to buffer areas where encroachment
occurs in other areas on a development site and may obtain an acre for acre credit based on the
stream buffer zone impacted. A 2:1 credit could be obtained by determination of the Water Resource
Management Department in the event additional streamside buffer is set aside for encroachment of
the managed use and upland stream buffer zones.
I. Other Mitigation Techniques: Other creative mitigation techniques and plans may be considered
by the Water Resource Management Department.
413.11. Vegetation Preservation. The buffer shall provide for the preservation and enhancement of natural
vegetation or planting. No live vegetation may be removed from the Streamside and Managed Use Zones for
preparation of land for uses permitted in Table 4.32 unless approved by the Water Resource Management Department.
The Water Resource Management Department may grant approval of the removal of exotic vegetation (i.e. privet,
kudzu, etc.) provided that a vegetation restoration plan is submitted and approved prior to the disturbance of the
vegetation. The purpose of such plan is to ensure that native vegetation is restored to the Streamside Zone.
Where a developer or lot owner removes live vegetation from the buffer strip, in violation of this section, the Water
Resource Management Department shall require native vegetation of reasonable diameter in size to be planted so as
IV-39
to create a buffer area which is in compliance with this section. A vegetation restoration plan must be submitted and
approved by the Water Resource Management Department prior to restoration.
413.12. Vegetation Restoration Plan. A vegetation restoration plan shall include the following information:
A. Scaled map of lot showing buffer delineation (copy of the survey is acceptable).
B. Square footage of the actual area disturbed or proposed disturbed area.
C. Proposed vegetation to be removed from the buffer.
D. Proposed location, number, and species of plants to be planted in the disturbed area (See list of plant
species).
E. Type of ground cover to be placed in the disturbed area (i.e. mulch, pine straw, etc.).
F. Proposed planting schedule and deadline for completion of restoration activities.
413.13. Buffer Delineation. The following buffer delineations are required:
A. Stream boundaries including each buffer zone must be clearly delineated on all grading plans,
subdivision plats, site plans and any other development plans.
B. The outside boundaries of the Managed Use Zone of the stream buffer must be clearly marked onsite
by flagging or fencing prior to land disturbing activities.
C. The outside boundary of the Managed Use Zone must be permanently marked at highway stream
crossings.
D. Stream and buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all
surveys and recorded plats and noted on individual deeds.
E. Stream buffer requirements must be referenced in homeowners association documents.
413.14. Approved Permits. Where a landowner or his representative obtain permits from Alabama Department of
Environmental Management (ADEM) or the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers for proposed impact to the stream or
stream buffers then these approved mitigation impacts and plans would supersede the applicable requirements of these
sections of the ordinance. The regulations that these permits do not affect shall be applicable to the proposed
development site.
Section 414. Reclamation of Undeveloped Land. In the event that construction of a development has not begun in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, or has not been completed within one year of initiation, said
development shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting following the expiration of
the one-year period. At this meeting, the Planning Commission shall determine whether or not reasonable progress
toward completion of the development is being made. Evidence of reasonable progress toward completion may
include, but shall not be limited to, installation of streets, utility lines and stormwater management facilities; laying
structural foundations; and completion of any stage of a development approved under a staging plan pursuant to
Section 802.09(A). However, the clearing and grubbing of land, in the absence of other improvements, shall not by
itself constitute evidence of reasonable progress.
Upon a determination that reasonable progress is not being made, the Planning Commission may require the owner of
the development site to restore the land to the same condition that existed prior to the initiation of the development.
If such restoration is not feasible, the City Engineer and the Planning Director shall determine and prescribe an
acceptable condition or degree of reclamation; at the very least, the site shall be sodded or planted in grass, and
appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent or eliminate soil erosion. In all cases, restoration activities shall be
consistent with appropriate Best Management Practices as recommended by the Alabama Forestry Commission, the
IV-40
Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and/or the Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS).
Section 415. Floodplains. Development within or affecting a floodplain shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 7.5, FEMA Requirements, of the Auburn
Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
415.01. Permanent open space. All such areas shall be permanent open space. No uses or improvements other than
those permitted herein shall be permitted in any area consisting of floodplain as defined by this Ordinance.
415.02. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted within the floodplain as a matter of right:
A. All uses that are permitted in designated open spaces.
B. All uses that are classified as agriculture, nurseries, and outdoor recreation.
C. Piers, bridges and bridge approaches, and picnic shelters, so long as the building permit application
shows that a licensed engineer has certified that such structures are designed to withstand the forces
exerted by the 100-year flood event at that location.
Section 416. Steep Slopes. Development on steep slopes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.3.1.1  Review and Approval of Construction Best
Management Practices Plans of the Auburn Water Resource Management Design and Construction Manual.
All steep slope areas, as determined by the Water Resource Management Department, shall be identified on the
Construction Best Management Practices Plan and on any subdivision plats.
Section 417. Open Space. The open space requirements of Table 4-2 and this Section shall apply to residential
development only. Land that is required by this Ordinance to remain as open space may be used for the recreation,
agriculture, resource protection, amenity and other purposes specified in this Section. Open-space land shall be freely
accessible to all residents of a development, with the exception that agricultural land uses shall be permitted to restrict
access to that land to those solely engaged in agricultural pursuits. Open space shall have qualities making it useful
to residents of the development for either passive or active recreation, and will be developed to serve that purpose; or
shall serve an important visual role in separating the development from existing public ways or from other existing or
potential developments; or shall be of value in dividing the development into coherent sub-areas. Non-recreational
buildings, except those related to agricultural uses permitted under Section 417.01(C) shall not occupy open-space
land.
417.01. All developments required by this Ordinance to provide open space shall meet the following requirements.
A. Land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space and may not be separately sold,
subdivided, or developed, and no structures shall be built on such land, except as provided below.
All such properties shall be owned and maintained by the developer, owner of the development site,
homeowners association, or other private entity.
B. An open-space plan shall be submitted as a part of the application for a site plan or subdivision
approval. This plan shall designated and indicate the boundaries of all open-space areas required
by this Ordinance. The plan shall:
1. Designate areas to be reserved as open space. The specific design of open-space areas shall
be sensitive to the physical and design characteristics of the site.
2. Designate the type of open space, as established in this Section that will be provided.
3. Specify the manner in which the open space shall be perpetuated, maintained, and
administered in accordance with Section 417.
IV-41
C. The types of open space that may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance, together
with the maintenance required for each type, are as follows:
1. Natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas replanted with vegetation after
construction. Woodlands and wetlands are specific types of natural areas. Natural
watercourses are to be maintained as free flowing and devoid of debris. Stream channels
shall be maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels.
2. Agricultural uses specified in Section 404.01.
3. Garden plots are the division of open space into plots for cultivation as gardens.
4. Recreational areas are areas designed for specific, active recreational uses having minimal
requirements for structures, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, softball fields, and golf
courses. An enclosed structure shall be permitted in a recreational area only where it
directly supports a specific facility and does not require off-street parking. Recreational
areas shall be accessible to all residents of the development.
5. Greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open-space areas.
These greenways are encouraged to designate developed bicycle paths, footpaths, bridle
paths, fitness trails, or other similar development. Inter-connecting the greenway system
between residences and recreational areas in encouraged.
6. Commonly owned lawns consisting of grass with or without trees.
D. Open space shall be appropriately located and large enough to address the open space characteristics
cited throughout Section 417.
1. No dwelling unit shall be located more than 750 feet from designated open space. The
Planning Commission may waive this distance requirement where the developer proposes
a major recreational facility which will occupy at least 50 percent of the required open
space for the development. No more than ten (10) percent of the dwelling units in the
development may be occupied before this facility is completed and available for use.
Where intervening non-recreational properties separate a dwelling unit from an open space
area, the Planning Director may require an easement or other means of access for nonmotorized
traffic to avoid the need for pedestrians to cross or travel on roads carrying
vehicular traffic.
2. No parcel of property, or portion thereof, less than 40 feet wide and 7,500 square feet in
size shall be counted toward the designated open space requirement. Open space areas
containing paved or stabilized paths for pedestrians and/or bicycles shall be exempt from
this requirement if such paths are part of a comprehensive circulation system serving a
portion of the development.
3. All open space shall be easily visible and freely accessible.
4. The following shall not count toward fulfillment of designated open space requirements:
a) Platted lots for residential use or designated sites for manufactured homes or
recreational vehicles;
b) Easements for roads, driveways or any other use which is not consistent with the
purposes of open space as established in this Section;
IV-42
c) Required bufferyards in subdivisions where such bufferyards are located inside
residential lots;
d) Parking areas, including planter islands, planter strips, and peninsulas, containing
required landscaping;
e) Public or private right-of-way;
f) Private roads and driveways;
g) Areas of required spacing between structures, manufactured homes or recreational
vehicles;
h) Areas which have been cleared of vegetation, excavated, filled, or otherwise
altered from their natural state unless such alteration is consistent with the
proposed use of the open space parcel;
i) Any development site (as established by a site plan) containing a clubhouse or a
non-recreational use including, but not limited to, office, restaurants, gift shops,
and groundskeeper storage buildings;
j) Any other areas which the Planning Director finds to be inconsistent with the
intent of this Section.
In addition, no lake, pond, or other permanent water body shall constitute more than 25 percent of
the total open space required for the development. No golf course shall constitute more than 60
percent of the total open space required for the development.
417.02. Preservation of open space. Open-space areas shall be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as open
space is not diminished or destroyed. Where open space is to be provided within a subdivision, such areas shall be
designated by creating separate parcels within the perimeter of the plat. These parcels shall be labeled as to their
intended use, and the plat shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance responsibility.
Where open space is provided within a development site, which is the subject of a site plan, and is under different
ownership than the rest of the site, it shall nevertheless remain part of the development site pursuant to Section 802.11.
Unless the site plan is modified or terminated in accordance with Section 802.08, the open space areas shall be used
only as provided in Section 417. The site plan shall note the entity or entities having ownership and maintenance
responsibility.
Open-space areas may be owned, preserved, and maintained as required by this Section by any of the following
mechanisms or combinations thereof:
A. Common ownership of the open space by a homeowners association, which assumes full
responsibility for its maintenance.
B. Deed-restricted private ownership that shall prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of
the open-space land and provide the maintenance responsibility. This arrangement shall be noted
on the site plan and/or subdivision plat. Full and proper legal documentation shall be submitted to
the Planning Director prior to commencement of development activities.
Section 418. Land Use Intensity Classification and Bufferyards and Structure Height. All land uses that are
permitted by this Ordinance have been assigned a land use intensity class designation. This classification system
separates uses on the basis of the type and degree of nuisance or negative impact they are likely to impose on land
uses adjacent to them.
IV-43
Bufferyards are required to protect one class of use from adverse impacts caused by a use in another class or to
ameliorate the impact two uses in the same class may have on one another. Bufferyards between two uses in the same
land use intensity class are not required in this Ordinance for Classes V-XI, because the principal intent is to buffer
residential uses (found only in Classes I-IV) from nonresidential uses. However, the Planning Commission may
require bufferyards between two uses of the same intensity in Classes V-XI or between two uses of different intensity
where bufferyards are not required by the Ordinance if it appears that problems will result from placing unlike land
uses side by side without a bufferyard. This regulation benefits both the developer and the adjoining landowner(s),
because it allows the developer several options from which to choose in developing the property, while insuring each
neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developers choice.
Each land use is listed in one or more use intensity classes. A use must meet all the standards specified for that use in
Table 4-4. The standards that apply to the highest intensity class for a use shall be the maximum intensity permitted
for that use. There are standards that set maximum density, impervious surface ratio, floor area, and height.
Steeples, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, and similar ornamental/architectural features may exceed structure height
by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning district. Chimneys, ventilators, utility service
structures, solar panels, flag poles, fire escapes, stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit
by 12 feet. Exclusions from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or
railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend. Exclusions shall not exceed in cross
sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building. Exclusions from structure height shall not include
accessory rooftop structures such as greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and
similar structures. Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools and jogging tracks
shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does not exceed the height limit of the respective
zoning district.
Section 419. Land Use Intensity Class Standards. In keeping with the concept that performance should be the
relevant measure of any land use regulations the following Section classifies uses according to their respective impacts
(all uses within a use class are considered to have an equal impact on neighboring uses). A developer may develop at
an intensity that will minimize nuisances to neighbors or provide a denser bufferyard, if the land is developed at greater
intensities. The impacts of greater intensity may include greater impervious surface coverage, with associated
increased runoff, heat generation, reduced percolation, and open space, increased bulk and height of buildings,
increased traffic with associated noise and congestion, signs and exterior lighting visible from neighboring property,
late hours of operation, and other nuisances. Thus, for example, an office use on any lot may meet the standards of
Intensity Classes V, VI, VII, VIII, or IX (See Table 4-4). The range of intensity classes open to a use does not affect
whether it can locate on its lot, but only how it can develop on that lot. Performance standards are specified for each
intensity class; exceeding any single standard in an intensity class moves a use to the next higher intensity class. In
the event that a use does not appear in the next higher intensity class, it may not exceed any single criterion in the
highest intensity class in which it is listed.

NOTE: Certain structures are exempt from the maximum height regulations of this
Section, except as limited by any height restriction regulation of the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) or any duly appointed authority or agency:
a. Bulk storage silos and storage towers, which shall not exceed 100 feet in height.
b. Concrete batching and mixing towers, which shall not exceed 100 feet in height.
c. Public utility poles, towers, and wires.
d. Radio and television antennae and towers.
e. Towers for mechanical equipment or smoke, which shall not exceed 16 feet above roof line
of principal building.
f. Water tanks and standpipes.
g. Steeples, bell towers, clock towers, cupolas, and similar ornamental/architectural features may
exceed structure height by a maximum of 25% of the height limit of the respective zoning
district. Chimneys, ventilators, utility service structures, solar panels, flag poles, fire escapes,
stairway enclosures or elevator enclosures may exceed height limit by 12 feet. Exclusions
from structure height are parapet walls, (limited to a height of four feet) and balustrades or
railings that rise less than six feet from the floor or roof from which they extend. Exclusions
shall not exceed in cross sectional area 25 percent of the ground floor area of the building.
Exclusions from structure height shall not include accessory rooftop structures such as
greenhouses, pigeon houses, enclosed recreational or commercial amenities and similar
structures. Un-enclosed accessory rooftop recreational amenities such as swimming pools
and jogging tracks shall be permitted where the amenity (exclusive of safety railings) does
not exceed the height limit of the respective zoning district.
Section 420. Bufferyards.
420.01. Purpose of Bufferyards. The bufferyard is the buffer together with the planting required thereon. The
bufferyard requirements of this Ordinance are designed to minimize nuisances between adjacent land uses or between
a land use and a public road. The purpose of the buffer is to separate different land uses from each other in order to
eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or
parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions. In
addition to creating a separation, a buffer determines the building setback for all performance developments, except
where other setbacks are more restrictive. A structure in a performance development may require a setback greater
than the width of the bufferyard, depending on the height of the structure. This determination shall be made in
accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 502.03.
IV-47
The purpose of the planting is to create a visual separation between uses and to enhance the beauty of the City. This
is accomplished through preservation, protection, and planting of trees, particularly those trees recognized herein as
canopy and understory trees. The intent is to derive all the benefits of having trees, shrubs, and other plant materials.
Among the benefits are: minimizing temperature elevation, reducing noise and wind reduction, reducing stormwater
runoff and flooding, preventing soil erosion, producing of oxygen, fostering air quality through carbon dioxide
absorption, providing shelter and food for birds and other wildlife, and softening the visual impact of development
from public view and adjacent property. All these benefits contribute to a higher quality of life and enhance the appeal
and economic value of both residential and business properties of the City.
420.02. Bufferyard Application. This Ordinance requires that bufferyards be provided between uses in all districts
except in the Urban Core (UC) District, Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) District, Neighborhood
Redevelopment District (NRD), the Industrial (I) District, and the Neighborhood Conservation District. Bufferyards
between uses in these zones are not required except in cases where single-family residences occur on land abutting
development in UC, UN-E, UN-W, UN-S, NRD, or I zoning districts (See Tables 4-5 and 4-7). In addition, property
located in an Industrial District that has frontage along a designated corridor (See Section 429) must comply with the
thoroughfare frontage bufferyard requirements (Section 429.06) and a 10-foot wide bufferyard with two (2) canopy
trees per 100 linear feet is required for all development adjacent to all streets in the Industrial District. Planting
materials are specified in Section 426. Conventional subdivisions shall also be exempt from bufferyard requirements.
Where bufferyards are required between uses and zoning districts, they shall adhere to the buffer width requirements
shown on Tables 4-5 through 4-7 and the number and types of planting specified in Section 426.
The requirements of this article shall be met for all development sites and developments as defined in Article II. This
includes vacant, redeveloped or developed sites that require a zoning certificate, that involve changes in land use
category as defined in Sections 404 through 408, or that are subject to a conditional use permit. Sites that are
nonconforming as per Article VII of this ordinance and cannot physically meet the requirements of Article IV will be
subject to Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard requirements of Section 707.
420.03. Location of Bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending
to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public
or private street or right-of-way, but may include easements, at the discretion of the Planning, Water Resource
Management, and/or Public Works Departments.
420.04. Use of Bufferyards. A bufferyard may be used for passive recreation; it may contain unpaved walkways or
trails, provided that: (a) no required plant material is eliminated; (b) the specified width of the bufferyard is
maintained; and (c) all other regulations of the Ordinance are met. In no event, however, shall the following be
permitted in bufferyards: playing fields, stables, swimming pools, basketball courts, tennis courts, parking spaces or
merchandise display. No accessory structures other than signs authorized under Article VI shall be permitted in the
bufferyards. No impervious surfaces shall be permitted in a bufferyard except sidewalks, paved driveways or access
roads that may cross a bufferyard in providing vehicular or pedestrian access to a public street. In approving such
access points, the Planning Director shall determine: (a) that no more are proposed than necessary for the safety and
convenience of persons entering and leaving the development site; and (b) that the access points have been designed
so as to minimize the interference with the purposes of the bufferyard.
420.05. Ownership of Bufferyards. Bufferyards constitute an integral part of a development site, and may not be
subdivided, sold, dedicated, or otherwise conveyed separately from the development site of which they are a part. The
City shall not approve any development plan in which a required bufferyard or any portion of a required bufferyard
lies on land, which is not part of the development site.
420.06. Responsibility for Bufferyard. All bufferyards, in their entirety, are the responsibility of the owner(s) of
the development site on which they are located. No required bufferyard shall be divided by a boundary between
different development sites.
Bufferyards within performance subdivisions shall be dedicated to and maintained by a homeowners association or
equivalent organization; such dedication shall be indicated on the final plat prior to recording. Where a required
bufferyard is located on common property, said common property shall be owned by the homeowners association.
IV-48
Where a required bufferyard crosses a privately owned lot, a bufferyard easement of the required width shall be created
on the lot, said easement being held by the homeowners association.
Where required bufferyards are absent, destroyed or in need of maintenance, and a homeowners association does not
exist or is inactive, individual property owners shall be responsible for their respective shares of the bufferyard. Fines
assessed under Section 909 may be used by the City to provide the required landscaping. Bufferyards on common
property are the joint responsibility of all property owners within the development site, who shall be assessed equal
shares of any City expenses incurred in restoring such bufferyards.
420.07. Maintenance of Bufferyard Areas. All buffer areas and plant materials shall be maintained by the owner,
occupant, tenant, and/or respective agent of each such bufferyard, so that the purpose and effect of the bufferyard is
not diminished. The following minimum maintenance activities are required:
A. Replacement of plant materials destroyed by any cause. In the case any trees or shrubs are destroyed
by natural causes, plant size, in terms of caliper, height, and gallon, as the original planting must be
used as a replacement. If trees are removed or destroyed by the willful act of the property owner,
occupant, tenant, contractor, and/or respective agent of each, replacement trees of a greater caliper
than the original planting may be required as determined by the Planning Director.
B. Repair and/or replacement of fences and walls that deteriorate or are damaged by any cause.
C. Restoration of bufferyards that are altered by erosion, construction, or other causes.
Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section shall be deemed a violation of the Ordinance. Violators will
be given written notice of the violation and permitted 15 days to correct the violation or submit a landscape plan and
planting schedule before a citation is issued. Thereafter, each day shall be considered a separate offense and shall be
punishable by the maximum fine established by the City Council of Auburn.
The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more restrictive bufferyard than the one
required in Table 4-5, 4-6, or 4-7.
420.08. Bufferyard Requirements. Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the buffer and type
and quantity of planting materials. The type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard and structure
type option are specified in Sections 426 through 428. A structure type is a wall, fence or berm erected to satisfy
bufferyard requirements. The structure type requirements of a bufferyard requiring such may be satisfied by any of
the options illustrated. The options within any bufferyard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness
in attenuating the impact of adjoining uses. Figures 4-2 and 4-3 graphically indicate the structure type options for
certain types of bufferyards (See Tables 4-5 through 4-7). Sections 426 and 427 specify species and size of plant
materials and recommended minimum planting areas. Plant materials identified in Section 426 shall satisfy the
requirements of this Ordinance. Any variation from plantings in Appendix A will be reviewed by the Planning
Department staff in conjunction with consultation with the City Arborist.
Appropriate landscaping materials for bufferyards include but are not limited to, turf grass, trees, shrubs and seasonal
color, as well as stone, rocks and mulch. Where mulch is used, the area must be kept free of weeds.
Section 421. Determination of BufferWidth. To determine the width of a buffer required between two (2) adjacent
parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:
A. Identify the land use category of the proposed use by referring to Sections 404 through 408.
B. Identify the use category of the land use(s) adjacent to the proposed use by on-site survey.
C. Identify the land use intensity class of all adjoining land uses by referring to Table 4-4. The City
will supply this information.
IV-49
D. Determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by
referring to Tables 4-5 through 4-7.
E. Determine the street classification of adjacent streets by using Appendix B, for use in Table 4-7.
F. Calculate the required setback based on the building height in accordance with Section 502.03.
Tables 4-5 through 4-7 specify the widths of the buffer required between adjacent existing land uses and streets.
Buffer width averaging shall be permitted along individual property lines as long as the overall width is maintained.
The width of the buffer shall not be less than five (5) feet in any location.
The buffer widths cited constitute the total buffer required on the subject property based on the nature of the adjoining
land use.
The Planning Commission, as part of Conditional Use Approval may select a more appropriate buffer than the one(s)
required in Table 4-5, 4-6 or 4-7.

Notes: Residential uses shall provide a 15-foot buffer area against a railroad with 16 tree inches per 100 feet.
1. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 1.
2. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 2.
3. Residential buffer required along with Structure Type Option 3.
4. For projects in the UC, all three (3) UN districts, NRD, CRD, SCCD, and I districts, no bufferyard
is required if the vacant land is in the same zoning district.
5. Structure Type Option 1 is required for this bufferyard; however, the structure type may be waived
in exchange for a 20% increase in required understory and shrubs.
6. A 10-foot bufferyard with two (2) canopy trees per 100 linear feet is required in the Industrial
District for all development adjacent to all streets.
Section 422. General Landscaping Requirements.
422.01. Landscaping Requirements. This Section details the general planting required on a particular development
site. A tree inches per acre system shall be used to determine the number and types of trees required on a development
site. Table 4-8 specifies the required inches per acre and the required number of shrubs based on the size of the
development site.
The procedure for calculating the number and types of trees required on a development site is as follows:
A. Determining the Total Tree Inches Required on a Development Site. To obtain the required number
and type of planting materials, find the tree inches that correspond with the acreage of the
development site. If the acreage of the development site is not a whole number, round the acreage
to the nearest whole number in order to obtain the total tree inches. Multiply the tree inches by the
actual acreage of the development site. Round all numbers to the nearest whole number. This
number is the total inches of trees to be planted on the development site. If the property abuts a
conventional residential subdivision, see Section 426.03 for additional tree inches to be added to the
total inches of trees calculated.
B. Determining the Minimum Number of Canopy and Understory Trees. Before determining the
number of canopy and understory trees, a 60:40 ratio (canopy tree inches to understory tree inches)
IV-51
shall be applied to the total tree inches. Once tree inches for each type have been determined, the
tree inches will be converted into the number of trees to be required on the site.
Canopy trees: Multiply the total inches of trees by sixty percent (60%) to get the tree inches to be
devoted to canopy trees. To convert the tree inches to actual tree count, the inches for canopy trees
should be divided by 2, which is the minimum caliper for canopy trees. The quotient is the number
of canopy trees to be planted on the development site.
Understory Trees: Take the total tree inches and multiply it by forty percent (40%) to get the tree
inches to be devoted to understory trees. To convert the inches to actual tree count, the inches for
understory trees should be divided by one (1), which is the minimum caliper for understory trees.
This number is the actual number of understory trees to be planted on the development site. Again,
this number may be diminished by any applicable tree preservation credits (see Section 427).
EXAMPLE: 1.5 Acres × 53 inches (tree inches for 2 acres) = 79.5
round to 80 inches of trees
80 × 60% = 48 inches
48 ÷ 2.0 caliper = 24 canopy trees
80 × 40% = 32 inches
32 ÷ 1.0 caliper = 32 understory trees
The owner would be required to plant 24 canopy trees and 32 understory trees for a total of 56 trees.
If the owner decides to plant all canopy trees, he would plant 40 canopy trees and no understory
trees on the development site.
C. Minimum Standards. An owner shall be allowed to exceed the minimum number of trees on a
development site as long as the total required tree inches have been met. The total tree inches
required on a development site may be met by planting all canopy trees, but not by planting all
understory trees. The maximum number of understory trees shall not exceed forty percent (40%)
of the total tree inches.
D. Shrubs. The number of shrubs to be planted on the development site is found on Table 4-8. The
number of shrubs is determined by the size of the development site. If the acreage of the
development site is not a whole number, round the acreage to the nearest whole number in order to
obtain the number of shrubs per acre. Then multiply the number of shrubs per acre by the actual
acreage of the development site. The product is the number of shrubs to be planted on the
development site.
Example: 1.5 × 84 (shrubs for 2 acres) = 126 shrubs
E. Landscaping Near Utilities. Canopy trees shall not be placed within 10 feet of existing or proposed
underground utilities or on designated utility easements.
422.02. Street Frontage Landscaping Requirements.

(See Table 4-7)

(per 100 feet)
Understory Trees inches

Shrubs (number of)
(per 100 feet)
10 feet 3 inches 3 inches 8
15 feet 4 inches 4 inches 10
Sites with narrow street frontages, in proportion to the total acreage, may be granted a waiver by the Planning Director
or his designee. The applicant is required to request the waiver in letter form with the submitted landscape plans.
IV-52
Existing trees located in the street frontage buffer area may receive credits if the trees are protected in accordance with
Section 429. The required number of canopy tree inches must be installed, unless the Planning Director, or his or her
designee, deems that the canopy tree will conflict with utilities. In such cases, the total number of tree inches may be
installed using understory trees.
Example: A street has a linear frontage of 250 feet and requires a 15 foot buffer. Using the table above, they would
be required to have at least five (5) 2-inch canopy trees, ten (10) 1-inch understory trees and 25 shrubs. This would
equate to 20 tree inches in the bufferyard including 10 canopy and 10 understory tree inches. Using the tree inch
method the applicant could use larger trees to reduce number of total trees required. If the applicant used 4-inch
canopy trees and 2-inch understory trees he or she could install three (3) canopy trees and five (5) understory trees.
Furthermore, the applicant could install five (5) 4-inch canopy trees and not be required to install any understory trees.
Should a street master tree plan be implemented for a particular street which the development site fronts; the plantings
from the street tree master plan will supersede the street frontage requirements for that particular frontage.
422.03. Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements. Additional planting materials shall be added to the
landscaping requirements for property that abuts a conventional subdivision. Twenty (20) tree inches per 100 linear
feet of buffer area shall be added to the inches per acre requirements for any property lines abutting conventional
residential development. The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to determine the number of canopy versus
understory trees to be planted. Shrubbery shall be provided between plantings at thirty-five (35) shrubs per 100 feet.
Planting materials for a residential buffer shall be installed in the buffer area along the property line(s) abutting a
conventional residential subdivision. Under no circumstances, can these inches be allocated to other areas on the
development site.
Development sites which are separated from conventional subdivisions by the railroad right-of-way are exempt from
this requirement.
422.04. Off-Street Parking Landscaping Requirements. Wherever a bufferyard required under Section 420.08
overlaps or coincides with a parking area as defined in this Section, the bufferyard shall take precedence; planting
required under this Section shall be placed in another location.
Existing canopy, understory, and shrub species may be counted as contributing to the total landscaping required,
provided they are located within areas addressed by this Section. The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy
the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant Materials.
Landscape areas shall be provided in the interior parking area to break the expanse of pavement, provide visual relief
and minimize temperature elevation from the expanse of asphalt. Landscape areas shall consist of planter islands,
planter strips, or peninsula types. In order to count toward the off-street parking landscape requirements, a planter
island, planter strip, or peninsula shall have a minimum area of three-hundred four (304) square feet with a minimum
width of nine (9) feet (hereafter referred to as contributing landscape areas). Peninsulas may be designed within or
adjacent to the interior parking area. The square footage of each planter island, planter strip or peninsula within the
parking lot must be shown; all contributing landscape areas should be designated on the landscape plan by shading or
otherwise differentiated from any non-contributing landscape area. Foundation landscaping (landscaping immediately
adjacent to building) shall not be considered interior parking area landscaping. Figure 4-1 graphically illustrates the
area that constitutes the interior parking area and the landscape area types.
The total area provided for off-street parking landscaping shall comply with one of the following options:
Option 1: One (1) contributing landscape island is required for every sixteen (16) parking spaces in a parking
lot.
The requirements of this Section shall apply to all off-street parking areas containing twelve (12) or more
paved parking spaces. If an existing parking lot is expanded or improved to add twelve (12) or more spaces,
it shall comply with the off-street parking landscaping requirements of this ordinance within the expanded or
improved portion.
IV-53
Option 2: A minimum of 10% of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped. The boundary of the interior
parking area must be shown on the landscape plan. The interior parking lot area is that area inside of the
parking lot curb or edge of pavement consisting of parking spaces, drive aisles, driveways and immediately
adjacent areas including all landscape areas. The maximum distance in any direction between islands and
peninsulas shall be one hundred eighty (180) feet and one hundred twenty (120) feet for planter strips
measured from the closest landscaped planting area curb edge.
A minimum of one (1) canopy tree shall be required for and must be planted in each contributing landscaped island
or peninsula regardless of the tree credits received. Larger contributing landscape areas shall require one (1) additional
canopy tree for each additional three hundred four (304) square feet of area (i.e. a six hundred eight (608) square foot
contributing landscape area requires two (2) canopy trees. Any additional landscaped areas, beyond the required
number, may be planted with understory trees and/or shrubs. One (1) canopy tree per one-hundred (100) linear feet
shall be planted in continuous planter strips. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and/or other ground
covering. In some instances, these requirements of Section 420.07 may require planting materials in excess of those
required by Section 422.05. Existing canopy trees located elsewhere on the development site shall not count as
contributing to the landscaping requirement for parking areas.
All planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion by the installation of curbing or other wheel stops.
Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more than two and a half feet, as long as curbing or
other wheel stops are provided to insure no greater overhang or penetration of the landscaped area.
The City of Auburn Planning Department and/or Planning Commission may vary the minimum off-street parking
landscaping requirements if specific circumstances and/or site conditions warrant such action. Under no
circumstances can the landscaped areas be less than ninety (90) square feet, with a minimum width of five (5) feet.
The type and quantity of plant materials that satisfy the requirements of this Section are specified in Section 426, Plant
Materials.
422.05. Placement of Plants and Structures. The exact placement of required plants and structure types shall be the
decision of each user; however, no less than 40% of the general landscape material installed on a development site
must be located in a buffer area when bufferyards are required. Per the International Fire Code, Section 507.05, a 3-
foot clear space shall be maintained around the circumference of fire hydrants. There should be no obstruction
preventing easy coupling of fire hoses or turning on the hydrant. The hydrant should be visible from all approaches.
Items such as shrubs, brush, posts and fences should not be placed or kept near fire hydrants. Any remaining
landscaping outside of the required bufferyards and parking landscaping should be placed to soften the facades of
buildings. The plantings should be placed near the foundations of the buildings, if possible. Additionally, all
developments must submit a Landscape Plan showing landscaping required by this Ordinance. See Figures 4-2 and 4-
3 for structure types.
422.06. Structures. The Planning Director may waive a structure (Type 1 or 2) requirement on a performance
residential development in the Redevelopment District (RDD), Comprehensive Development District (CDD) and
Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) zoning districts. The waiver will be considered where structures are
required to abut certain outdoor recreational uses, specifically parks, picnic areas, play fields and playground. The
waiver request must be accompanied by a letter of justification from the applicant.
422.07. Reuse of an Existing Site. For landscaping requirements for the reuse of an existing building, refer to Section
707 of this Ordinance. The landscape requirements will be determined by the adjacent land uses and the location of
the proposed new use.

Section 423. Tree Preservation Credit. In order to encourage the conservation of existing trees and the
incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, credit will be given for specimen trees and any other trees that
are successfully preserved and protected in accordance with tree protection methods specified in Section 425.
In order for a tree to qualify for tree credit, it must be identified on the Landscape Plan, protected during land
disturbance as required in Section 425 and meet the all minimum standards outlined in this Ordinance.
The credit allowed for a freestanding tree shall be the actual Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of the tree saved. Only
trees with a DBH measurement of four (4) inches or greater and spaced appropriately for future growth shall be eligible
for tree credit. Tree credit shall only be given to trees with main trunks located on the development site. No tree
credits shall be applied toward meeting the tree inches allocated to the Street Frontage and Residential Buffers, unless
the trees are located in these buffer areas.
If during construction, trees that are shown on the Landscape Plan to be preserved are cleared or removed, then
replacement trees shall be required equal to the total inches of credit given for the trees in accordance with this Section.
Section 424. Specimen Trees or Stands of Trees.
When making a determination on the identification of specimen trees, the following standards shall be adhered to:
A. Any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes:
(1) Large Hardwood Trees: 24-inch DBH or larger, such as oaks, hickories, poplars, etc.
(2) Large Coniferous Trees: 30-inch DBH or larger, such as pines, cedars, etc.
(3) Understory Trees: 4-inch DBH or larger, such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
B. A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum health standards:
(1) A life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
(2) A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than 20%
radial trunk dieback.
(3) No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
(4) No major insect or pathological problem.
C. A tree of a lesser-size than specified in this Section can be considered a specimen tree if it is:
(1) A rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance.
(2) Specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a
landscape project.
(3) A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value in the
opinion of the City. Determination is based upon the following criteria:
(a) A relatively mature, even-aged stand.
(b) A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
(c) A stand of historical significance.
(d) A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
IV-59
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects,
additional credit will be given for specimen trees which meet the standards outlined in Section 428. In addition, the
specimen tree must be successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any
specimen tree thus saved shall be twice the normal credit.
Section 425. Tree Protection.
425.01. Purpose. The purpose of this section shall be to establish methods of protecting trees and their root systems
during the land development process.
425.02. Methods of Tree Protection. Root space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the land
development process. The root system of trees easily goes beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. Disturbances within
the critical root zone can directly affect a trees chances for survival. To protect the root zone, the following methods
are suggested:
A. Tree Protection Area  A tree protection area for all trees within the R.O.W., and any trees proposed
to remain within 25 feet of any proposed grading, clearing, tree removal or construction shall be
established by physical barriers prior to any land disturbance and maintained until such work is
completed. All tree protection areas shall be defined by at least a concentric circle centering on the
trunk with a radius equal in feet to the number of inches of the trees diameter at breast height. In
no cases shall the radius be less than 8 feet. Example: A 12 DBH tree would have a 12 radius (24
diameter) tree protection area.
B. Protective Barriers  Protective tree fencing shall be installed at the edge of the tree protection area
prior to any land disturbance. Where feasible, fencing should extend beyond the drip line of the trees
being protected. Fencing shall be a minimum of 4 feet in height, consisting of orange polyethylene
laminar or chain link fabric secured with metal T-posts, or other means approved by the City
Arborist.
C. Signage  The placement of Tree Protection and/or Keep Out signage shall be attached to the
physical barrier at all times. The location and quantity of signage shall be on all sides and convey
the intent of the tree protection area and barriers.
D. Construction Activity  Construction activities (such as grading, parking, storing equipment or
materials, trenching, digging, washing or rinsing, etc.) shall not be allowed within the tree protection
area. Utilities, irrigation lines or any underground fixture shall be routed around the tree protection
areas. Necessary installation through the tree protection areas shall be accomplished by boring under
the root system at a minimum depth of 24 inches.
E. Other acceptable Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Tree Protection (See BMPs for Trees
found in the Appendix).
Section 426. Plant Materials. Sections 426 and 426.01 specify the plant materials and standards that must be met
in order to satisfy the requirements of Sections 420 through 421 (bufferyards), 422 through 422.03 (general
landscaping), 422.04 (off-street parking), and 707 (nonconforming bufferyards).
426.01. Plant Material Specifications. A plant materials matrix designating the breakdown of the tree types
(Appendix A of this Ordinance) shall be used to determine which plant materials may be used to satisfy the
requirements of this Ordinance under specified conditions. Any variation from plantings in Appendix A will be
reviewed by the Planning Department staff in conjunction with consultation with the City Arborist. The vertical axis
of the matrix classifies plant materials by type: canopy trees, understory trees, evergreen trees, deciduous shrubs and
evergreen shrubs. These plant types correspond to the plant types specified by the sections of this Ordinance which
require planting.
IV-60
It shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or property owner to select species from Appendix A that are
appropriate to the locations in which they will be planted, and to maintain them so as to meet the intent of this
Ordinance.
All plant materials shall meet minimum standards of caliper, fullness of form, height, root ball and vigor as described
by the American Association of Nurserymen standards published in the current edition of American Standards for
Nursery Stock.
In the event of inclement weather or mitigating circumstances, landscape material may be bonded in accordance with
procedures established by the City of Auburn Planning Department.
426.02. Minimum Plant Size. Unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this Ordinance, all plant
materials shall meet the following minimum size standards:
MINIMUM PLANT SIZE AND TYPE
Plant Material Type All Plantings
Canopy Tree
Single Stem 2 to 2 ½ inch caliper and 12 height
Multi-Stem Clump 25 gallon AND 8 height
Evergreen Canopy 25 gallon AND 6 height
Understory Tree*
Single Stem 15 gallon AND 6 height
Multi-Stem Clump 15 gallon AND 6 height
Shrub 3 Gallon AND 18 inches high
Ground Cover 1 Gallon AND 6 inches high
Notes:
Unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere in this Ordinance, all plant materials shall meet the following minimum size standards:
All plants should meet American Standards for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1-1996).
All minimum height requirements listed shall be planted height.
Balled and burlap or field grown materials that meet caliper and height requirements and ANSI standards are acceptable.
*No more than 50% combined may be crepe myrtle and/or Bradford pear in any landscape.
Section 427. Minimum Planting Areas.
In order to provide sufficient growing areas for planted urban trees, the following minimum planting areas are
recommended:
1. Canopy Trees  304 square feet of pervious root zone
2. Understory Trees  90 square feet of pervious root zone
Section 428. Landscape Plan Submission Requirements. In the interest of improving the landscape design,
approval, installation and inspection process, landscape plans shall be required as part of the site plan approval process.
If tree credits are desired, the Landscape Plan shall consist of a three phase plan: a Tree Survey Plan (Section 428.A),
a Tree Protection Plan (Section 428.B) and a Tree Replacement Plan (Section 428.C).
If tree credits are not desired, the landscape plan shall consist solely of the Tree Replacement Plan (Section 428.C).
A preliminary landscape plan showing bufferyard widths and items 2 and 3 from the Tree Replacement Plan is required
with the Development Review Team (DRT) submittal.
Unless otherwise stated, the final landscape plan shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Order of Submittal:
Prior to issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit:
1. Tree Survey Plan
2. Tree Protection Plan
IV-61
With Development Review Team (DRT) submittal, a plan showing:
1. Bufferyard widths
2. An outline of the parking area used for calculating 10% of the parking area, if using Option 2.
3. The size of the landscape islands, planter strips and peninsulas (if applicable) and their distances from the
nearest planted areas.
Prior to issuance of a building permit:
1. Tree Replacement Plan
A. The Tree Survey Plan. The Tree Survey Plan shall be in the form of a to-scale map or a site plan
noting the following information:
(1) A survey plan showing all trees, including specimen trees and specimen stands of trees,
that shall be preserved and shall count toward meeting the tree inches requirements. The
plan shall indicate the location, size and species of all trees to be preserved. Only trees
with a DBH of four (4) inches or greater are eligible for tree credit and shall be inventoried.
(2) Sampling methods may be used to determine inventory data for forested areas over two
acres.
(3) All critical root zones must be shown on the Survey. The critical root zone will typically
be represented by a concentric circle entering on the trees trunk with a radius equal in feet
to one (1) times the number of inches of the trunk diameter.
B. The Tree Protection Plan. The Tree Protection Plan is a detailed plan designed to protect and
preserve trees before, during, and for a period of two years after construction. The Tree Survey and
the Tree Protection Plans shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a clearing and grubbing permit,
preferably with the engineering certificate. The Plan shall include the following specifications:
(1) The location, size, species, and critical root zone of all trees to be preserved on site or
within the R.O.W.
(2) All tree protection areas and methods of protection including, but not limited to, tree
fencing, retaining walls, signage, etc.; details of all permanent tree protection methods.
(3) Locations of all existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, detention areas, etc.

Director or City Arborist.
C. The Tree Replacement Plan. The Tree Replacement Plan (otherwise referred to as a Landscape
Plan) is intended to fill the gap between the preserved trees and the remaining tree planting
requirements of the bufferyards. The Tree Replacement Plan shall include the following:
(1) The project name, street address, date, scale, North arrow and the name and phone number of
the person preparing the plan,
IV-62
(2) An outline of the parking area used for calculating 10% of the parking area, if using Option 2.
(3) The size of the landscape islands, planter strips and peninsulas (if applicable) and their distances
from the nearest planted areas.
(4) The location, size, species, and critical root zone of all trees to be preserved and replanted on
the development site or within the R.O.W. Location of shrubs is also required. Unless otherwise
approved by the City Arborist and/or Planning Director, all trees selected for replanting must
be on the Citys Permitted Plant List (see Appendix A). Plants selected for planting must be
free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders, or root defects, and must be of good vigor
in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting should
be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication
Tree and Shrub Planting Manual or similar publication; for plant material quality
specifications, reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication American
Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60, 1973); for information on tree species site

size, spacing, any special planting notes, and planting details. This shall include a matrix
showing the required and provided tree and shrub quantities by type (canopy, understory and
shrub) and size.
(9) Large shrubs may be included in the Tree Replacement Plan, but should not be used for the
purpose of meeting the tree inches requirement for the development site.
(10) The plan shall especially respect sight triangles and sight distances at all intersections.
428.01. Certified Landscape Plan. Landscape plans shall be prepared and certified by a Landscape Architect,
Certified Landscape Professional, Licensed Landscape Designer or Urban Forester with specifications for such plan
contained therein. Other licensed professionals (e.g. architects, engineers, etc.) may be authorized by the Planning
Director to prepare the landscape plans, provided that they demonstrate competence to the satisfaction of the Director.
Where necessary, these plans can be drawn in a conceptual manner to maintain conformance with the Zoning
Ordinance, while omitting the specifics of placement until final landscape plan approval.
Section 429. Corridor Overlay Area Regulations.
429.01. Purpose and Scope. Recognizing the special nature of certain thoroughfares and the direct and indirect
impacts of the appearance of these roadways and their importance to the local economy, this Section sets forth
regulations that will help insure that development in these critical areas is visually pleasing and economically viable.
This Section applies to all land in the corridor, regardless of the underlying zoning district designation, and supersedes
base district zoning district regulations in the corridor unless the zoning district requirements are more stringent. In
those cases, the base district regulations apply. Henceforth, as parcels are developed or redeveloped along designated
corridors, the following bufferyard and landscape requirements shall apply.
IV-63
429.02. Areas of Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all lots, parcels and tracts that have any frontage
upon the following rights-of-way:
Bragg Avenue

429.03. Submission Requirements. All design elements required by this Section shall be illustrated or described
within the application materials prepared for the review of staff and the Planning Commission. Any submission made
without such requirements shall be deemed incomplete. Incomplete submissions shall not be considered for inclusion
on Planning Commission agendas.
429.04. Site Considerations. All site plans shall be developed so as to preserve, where possible, any existing
significant vegetation.
429.05. Building Materials and Design Review. The Planning staff shall review submissions for their general
compatibility with existing conditions and public improvements according to the process for conditional uses outlined
in Article VIII.
A. Exterior Building Materials. All building cladding materials shall be described in the application
and shown on elevation drawing submitted with the site plan. Building facades and accessory
buildings visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic shall consist of natural materials such as wood,
stone, and manufactured products such as brick, stucco, architecturally decorative concrete block,
single-lap horizontal cemetitious siding with offsetting vertical joints (maximum seven (7) inch
exposure), cemetitious simulated cedar shake (exposure on shake), or other such materials as may
be approved after the review by the Planning Commission. All structural supports (i.e., columns)
for vehicular canopies shall be clad in one or more of the same materials as the building facades.
Exposed metal with architectural metal finishes (i.e., Alucobond or similar type of materials) may
only be used as architectural trim and accents.
IV-64
B. Sign Design. The location of freestanding signs shall be illustrated on the site plan. Sign materials
shall be coordinated with the exterior cladding of the structures.
429.06. Bufferyards and Setbacks. On all developments, the owner or developer must provide the required setback
and the required buffer area (see Section 502.02 and Section 422) or minimum buffer areas described below,
whichever is greater. In cases where adjoining developments have the same land use intensity classifications, the
minimum buffer area shall be provided except where developments share common walls or otherwise result in zerolot
line construction. The planting materials installed in the buffer areas must meet the specifications referenced
below. In those cases where a conditional use is requested for an existing structure, only the required frontage
bufferyard shall be required. Developments in the Urban Core (UC) District and the Urban Neighborhood West (UNW)
District east of North Donahue Drive are exempt from the bufferyard requirements.
A. Bufferyard Requirements. A 15-foot buffer shall be installed along the entire frontage of
thoroughfares listed in Section 429.02. The minimum side and rear buffers shall be five (5) feet
wide. These buffer areas shall contain planting material in accordance with Section 422, General
Landscaping Requirements. The development site is also subject to Sections 422 through 428.
For property within an Industrial district, the thoroughfare frontage buffer area shall contain 16 tree
inches per 100 feet of corridor frontage. The 60:40 ratio shall be applied to the tree inches to
determine the number of canopy versus understory trees to be planted. Shrubbery shall be provided
between plantings at twenty (20) shrubs per 100 feet.
The Planning Director may grant waivers to portions of the side and rear buffer areas, in terms of
square footage and planting materials, to be relocated to other areas on the development site. The
applicant shall submit a request along with a landscape plan showing how the proposed buffer areas
will be relocated.
See Section 426.04 for Off-Street Parking Landscaping requirements.
B. General Right-of-Way Setback. All structures shall be at least 20 feet from the right-of-way line
of those thoroughfares listed in Section 429.02 unless otherwise regulated in Sections 507 Urban
Core, Section 508 College Edge Overlay District, Section 509 Urban Neighborhood Districts, and
Section 510 Corridor Redevelopment District.
C. Garages, Car Washes and Service Bays. All garages, car washes or other service bays shall be
located at least 40 feet from the front property line and all garage/car wash/service bay openings
shall be oriented at not less than right angles to the primary public street frontage.
D. Dumpsters and all other refuse collection devices shall be located behind the front plane of the
primary structure and shall be fully screened from public view.
429.07. Fences and Screening.
A. Lot areas within which repair of vehicles of any type occurs shall be screened from public view.
Storage areas of vehicles that are visibly damaged or under repair shall be similarly screened.
B. Utility meters, air conditioners and other mechanical units shall not be located on any plane of the
primary structure that faces a designated corridor and shall be screened from public view. Screening
shall be architecturally designed or of a material similar in quality and appearance to other areas of
the building façade. For example, a parapet wall may be used to screen rooftop equipment.
Effective screening should not call attention to itself, but quietly complement the building.
C. No type of wire fabric fencing material shall be used forward of the front plane of the primary
structure. Fences in the front yards shall not exceed four (4) feet in height.
IV-65
429.08. Awnings and Canopies. Rigid or fixed awnings and canopies must be maintained and kept free from dirt,
mildew and tears. Worn, faded or torn awnings and canopies shall be replaced.
Section 430. Transportation Impact Report. Transportation impact reports shall be prepared in accordance with
the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 4.1, Traffic Impact Study Requirements, of the Auburn
Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
Section 431. Clear View of Intersection Streets. Development at intersecting streets shall provide a clear view and
be designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations, requirements and specifications of Section 5.3,
Intersection Design Elements, of the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
Section 432. Traffic Management.
432.01. Curb Cuts. Design and construction of curb cuts shall be in accordance with the regulations, requirements
and specifications of Section 5.2, Roadway Design Elements, of the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction
Manual.
432.02. Access for Lots of Record and Redevelopment. In the interest of public safety, lots of record, as defined
by this Ordinance, shall be afforded vehicular access at the direction of the City Engineer. This access may take the
form of a curb cut directly onto a public right-of-way or may be limited to cross-access via an adjoining lot. The City
reserves the right to adopt access plans for thoroughfares in rapidly redeveloping areas in order to facilitate traffic
management and public safety. The Planning Commission and City Council shall approve such plans.
432.03. Acceleration/Deceleration Lanes. Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be provided by the developer at the
direction of the City Engineer. Such improvements must be designed and constructed to city, county or state standards.
Design and construction of deceleration lanes shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.3 Intersection
Design Elements, of the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
432.04. Cross-Access Requirements. Adjoining lots with frontage upon collector or arterial roads may be required
to provide cross-access to adjacent properties in the interest of accommodating the curb-cut requirements, public safety
and facilitating vehicular traffic. Such access shall be required at the discretion of the City Engineer.
Shared driveways, cross access driveways, connected parking lots, and service drives shall be recorded as an access
easement and shall constitute a covenant running with the land. Operation and maintenance agreements for these
facilities should be recorded with the deed.
432.05. Median Cuts. Center medians are designed and constructed both for traffic safety and aesthetic
considerations. Such public improvements are constructed at great expense to the public and, therefore, any alteration
of the existing or planned roadway medians shall be allowed solely at the discretion of the City Council and only
where such alteration is in the interest of public safety. Where such alterations are allowed, the entire cost shall be
borne by the applicant. The improvement of other medians or similar traffic control devices in proximity to the
proposed development may be required in consideration for any allowed median alteration.
432.06. Additional Right-of-way. Additional right-of-way required by a specific governmental plan for the

ARTICLE V. DETAILED USE REGULATIONS
Section 500. Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to specify the detailed regulations, including bulk, layout, setbacks and lot area,
which apply to specific land uses. Standards over and above those imposed by other sections of this
Ordinance are necessary for certain land uses which, although permitted as of right in certain districts, have
characteristics that might have negative impacts on nearby uses without these additional regulations. This
Article also specifies the regulations applicable to temporary and accessory uses, and it details the off-street
parking and loading requirements of permitted land uses.
Section 501. Standards Applicable to Certain Uses. In addition to compliance with other regulations
imposed by this Ordinance, the following standards are required of the specific uses enumerated below.
501.01. Renovation, Adaptive Reuse, and Preservation of Structures. Because there may be value to
the community in the renovation, reuse and preservation of structures, and because these actions serve the
public interest, renovation, reuse, and preservation of structures are encouraged in all zoning districts.
A. In addition to a site plan required pursuant to Section 802, each proposed renovation, reuse
or preservation of an existing structure shall include a floor plan showing the internal use
of the structure.
B. It is anticipated that the renovation, reuse, and preservation of existing structures will
involve difficulties with maximum densities in some zoning districts, bufferyard
requirements and off-street parking. Where these conditions occur, the Planning Director
may impose such standards as fencing, screening, and planting as he/she deems appropriate
to buffer existing adjacent properties. The Planning Director shall, in the case of higher
densities and off-street parking, make such recommendations to the Planning Commission
as he/she deems reasonable in supporting the concepts of renovation, reuse, and
preservation of structures in the City of Auburn.
501.02. Exceptions to Minimum Yard Requirements. The following structures shall be allowed to project
into or be constructed in any minimum required yard as follows: awnings and canopies, roof overhangs and
balconies not to exceed three (3) feet; bay windows, not to exceed two (2) feet; clotheslines; driveways and
their curbs, fences, walls, and hedges may be constructed in minimum yard areas, provided that their
installation does not violate any other provision of this Ordinance. Uncovered decks of no more than 30
inches in height may extend to within five (5) feet of the property line. Nothing contained in this Section
shall be construed to allow encroachment of any feature into a required bufferyard.
501.03. Voluntary Dedication of Property for a Public Purpose. No existing lot shall be reduced in area
or dimension below the minimum requirements applicable to such lot under the provisions of this Ordinance,
except that when a lot is reduced in dimension or total area by 20 percent or less by the voluntary dedication
by the owner and acceptance of a portion of such lot by the City for a public use, the lot shall be considered
to contain the dimensions and area it contained prior to such dedication. However, for purposes of measuring
compliance with setback requirements of this Code, the dimensions and area of such lot as it exists after the
voluntary dedication shall apply.
501.04. Limitations on Animals.
A. No person shall keep or maintain in connection with any residential dwelling unit more
than three (3) dogs aged six (6) months or older, except in the Rural (R) District.
B. The keeping or maintaining of horses, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other
such animal shall be regulated under Section 4-2 of the Municipal Code of the City of
Auburn. Said regulations shall apply within the stock district as established in Section 4-
2(a) of the Code.
V-2
Inside and outside of the stock district, the keeping of chickens is allowed, provided:
1. the minimum lot size of the property is 10,000 square feet
2. the principal use of the property is a single family dwelling
3. the number of chickens does not exceed:
a. four (4) on lots 10,000 square feet to 19,999 square feet
b. six (6) on lots 20,000 square feet or greater
4. the chickens are kept in an enclosure or fenced area such as a henhouse,
chicken coop, chicken tractor, etc. at all times
5. the chicken enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of six (6) square feet per
chicken
6. the chickens are not kept in any location on the property other than in the
backyard (the rear yard of the principal structure)
7. the covered enclosure or fenced area is a minimum of 10 feet to any property
line of an adjacent property and 30 feet from neighboring dwellings, church,
school, or place of business
8. the enclosures are kept in a clean, dry, odor-free, neat, and sanitary condition
at all times
9. the chicken owner takes necessary action to reduce the attraction of predators
and rodents and the potential infestation of insects and parasites
Roosters and the slaughtering of chickens are strictly prohibited inside of the stock district.
It shall be unlawful to engage in the breeding of chickens or the production of fertilizer for
commercial purposes.
It is unlawful for the owner of any chicken to allow the animal(s) to be a nuisance to any
neighbors, including but not limited to: noxious odors from the animals or their enclosure;
and noise of a loud and persistent and habitual nature.
Prior to construction of the chicken enclosure, a site plan shall be reviewed and approved
pursuant to Section 804.
Outside the established stock district, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, fowl or any other
such animal may only be maintained on lots of three (3) acres or more in the Rural (R)
District. Horses may be maintained only outside of the established stock district on lots of
two (2) acres or more with a limit of one (1) horse per acre.
C. No person shall breed or maintain any wild animal or reptile that, in the opinion of the
Environmental Services Director, poses a threat to human safety in Auburn. Excluded
from this restriction are zoos, pet shops, animal shelters, medical or scientific facilities, or
other locations where the showing or maintenance of such animals is a permitted use under
the provisions of this Ordinance.

building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to endanger the health and safety
of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural failure of the tower due to
extreme weather conditions or other acts of God.
C. Security. A chain link fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound, with
a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire, if
applicable). Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless otherwise
approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application of site plan approval. Guy
anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound. Climbing pegs shall be
removed from the lower 20 feet of all broadcast towers.
D. Lighting Restrictions. There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Federal Communications Commission
(FCC). In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any such
lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations. Written
documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided
herein must be submitted with the site plan application.
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity, shall not be directed or
reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten
(10) feet.

representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site.
F. Landscaping. Broadcast towers constructed in conjunction with a principal structure (i.e.
radio/TV station) shall comply with all bufferyard and landscape requirements as set out
in Article IV. Towers constructed as stand-alone facilities shall, in addition to the
bufferyard and landscape requirements set out in Article IV, provide the following general
landscaping directly outside the required fencing:
1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a
minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart.
2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed
in front of the tree line.
3. All plant material shall be xeriscape tolerant.
4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be
substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the
compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way. The
Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening.
V-4
G. Abandoned Facilities. Any broadcast facility that ceases to be used for its original
communications purpose shall be removed at the owners expense. The owner of the
facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the FCC of the
intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing to remove
the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural condition.
In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required
from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required
to remove its facilities within the one hundred and twenty (120) day period prescribed
above. At such time as all providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities
located thereon, the owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process
as set forth herein.
H. Area and Dimensional Requirements. The following area and dimensional regulations
shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section:
1. Minimum Lot Area: Determined by setback requirement.
2. Minimum Setbacks: Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance
equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel,
setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site).
Maintenance/equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as
specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed.
3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed
tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy anchors
may be fenced separately from the main compound.
4. Bufferyard Requirements: See Article IV, Section 420.08.
I. Height and Location Restrictions. In regard to the height and siting of all broadcast
facilities and their associated structures the following regulations shall be observed:
1. No broadcast tower site boundary shall be located closer than 200 feet to any
residence.
2. No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured from
the base of the tower, from any Neighborhood Conservation (NC) zoning
boundary. Any new towers so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or
self-supporting design.
3. No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet.
4. Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall
be sited behind the front plane of said structure. Property located in the Rural

demands for the geographic service area and the countywide network;
6. Certification that the proposed telecommunications tower is structurally and
technically designed and capable, and will be so constructed, to meet the coV-
6
location requirements set forth in this Section. Immediately upon completion of
construction, as-built certifications of same shall be submitted as well.
B. Co-location Requirements. All towers constructed subsequent to the adoption of this
Section, and their associated compounds, shall be designed and built to accommodate
additional wireless communication service providers based on the height of the tower as
follows:
1. Towers 80 to 159 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of two (2)
providers.
2. Towers 160 to 209 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of three (3)
providers.
3. Towers of 210 to 300 feet in height shall accommodate a minimum of four (4)
providers.
Carriers wishing to co-locate on an existing tower may receive administrative approval of
their request.
C. Maximum Utilization of Existing Sites. No new telecommunications tower shall be
constructed if space is structurally, technically, and economically available for the
proposed telecommunications antenna(s) and related facilities on an existing tower; or on
an alternative site (e.g. building or other structure), where such alternative location would
cover the required service area without creating undue signal interference.
D. Safety/Structural Design of Towers. All telecommunication towers must comply with
requirements as set out in the latest edition of the TIA-222 code (revised July 20, 2005)
Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures, as
amended, published by the Electronic Industries Association, and all other applicable
structural safety standards, building and technical codes having jurisdiction, so as not to
endanger the health and safety of residents, employees or travelers in the event of structural
failure of the tower due to extreme weather conditions or other Acts of God.
E. Security. A chain link steel fence shall be installed around the perimeter of the compound,
with a minimum height of eight (8) feet as measured to the top of the fence (or barbed wire,
if applicable). Such fence is to be located on the perimeter of the compound unless
otherwise approved as part of the site plan submitted with the application for site plan
approval. (Guy anchors may be fenced separately from the main compound). Climbing
pegs shall be removed from the lower 20 feet of all communication towers.
F. Lighting Restrictions. There shall be no lighting on any tower except when required by
the FAA or FCC. In cases where the FAA or FCC does require a tower to be lighted, any
such lighting shall be the minimum necessary to comply with federal regulations. Written
documentation of any FAA or FCC directives to light a tower differently than provided
herein must be submitted with the site plan application.
Any security lighting used at the facility shall be of low intensity shall not be directed or
reflected away from the site, and must not illuminate any portion of the site higher than ten
(10) feet.
G. Maintenance. The owner of a telecommunications tower shall be responsible for
maintaining the structural integrity, safety, appearance, screening, buffers, security and
other installations required by this Section, and by any other applicable codes, ordinances,
regulations, statutes or conditions of approval imposed by the City of Auburn or its
authorized representatives, in perpetuity for as long as said tower remains on a site.
V-7
H. Landscaping. In addition to the required bufferyards as determined by standards set out
in Article IV, Section 420.08, the following general landscaping shall be provided directly
outside the required fencing:
1. A row of evergreen trees a minimum of eight (8) feet tall when planted, placed a
minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 20 feet apart.
2. A continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs at least 30 inches high at planting placed
in front of the tree line.
3. All plant materials shall be xeriscape tolerant.
4. Preservation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fenced area may be
substituted for the bufferyard and landscape requirements if it screens the
compound from the view of adjacent development and rights-of-way. The
Planning Director shall make determination of appropriate screening.
I. Abandoned Facilities. Any wireless telecommunications facility that ceases to be used
for its original communications purpose shall be removed at the owners expense. The
owner of the facility shall provide the Planning Director with a copy of the notice to the
FCC of the intent to cease operations, and shall have 120 days from the date of such ceasing
to remove the obsolete tower and all accessory structures and to restore the site to its natural
condition.
In the case of multiple providers sharing use of a single tower, notice will still be required
from each provider as to their cessation of operations, and such provider will be required
to remove its facilities within the 120-day period prescribed above. At such time as all
providers sharing use of a tower cease operation of their facilities located thereon, the
owner of the tower shall complete the removal and restoration process as set forth herein.
J. Area and Dimensional Requirements. The following area and dimensional regulations
shall apply to all facilities covered by this Section:
1. Minimum Lot Area: Determined by setback requirement.
2. Minimum Setbacks: Each tower shall be set back from all property lines a distance
equal to 50 percent of its height (when site is a leased portion of a larger parcel,
setbacks shall be measured from the property lines, not the leased site).
Maintenance/Equipment buildings must meet the setback requirements as
specified for the zoning district in which they are to be constructed.
3. All buildings, structures, facilities and accessories associated with the proposed
tower are to be wholly contained within the required security fence. Guy anchors
may be fenced separately from the main compound.

V-8
2. No tower shall be located less than a distance equal to its height, as measured from
the base of the tower, from any Neighborhood Conservation (NC) zoning
boundary. Any new tower so located shall further be restricted to a monopole or
self-supporting design.
3. No tower shall exceed a height of 300 feet.
4. Where such facility is constructed in conjunction with a principal structure it shall
be sited behind the front plane of said structure. This provision shall not apply in
the Rural (R) District.
L. Pre-Existing Towers. Any telecommunications tower or telecommunications antenna for
which a permit has been properly issued shall hereafter be considered a non-conforming
use subject to the provisions of Article VII of this Ordinance. The purpose and intent of
this Section is to minimize the proliferation of new towers and promote the co-location of
new antennas onto existing towers. Any communications antenna locating on a preexisting
properly permitted telecommunications tower subsequent to adoption of this
Section shall be exempt from the restrictions of Article IV of this Ordinance when the
provisions below are met:
1. If structural strengthening is necessary to accommodate co-location, the tower
type shall remain the same as previously permitted.
2. There will be no increase in the total height or type of lighting of the facility,
including the tower, antennas and all other associated facilities.

2. Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by public
emergency agencies or government agencies.
3. Accessory facilities used exclusively for dispatch communications by private
entities, or for internal communications by public utilities, provided such facilities
do not exceed a total of 60 feet in height whether mounted to a structure or ground
mounted.
The Planning Director shall make determination of exemption of any such facilities
exceeding the foregoing dimensions.
Section 502. Residential Use Regulations. This Section specifies the minimum lot dimensions and other
requirements for each type of residential unit permitted by this Ordinance, except in the Neighborhood
Conservation District (NC).
V-9
When a lot size exceeds the minimum permitted area, all other standards applicable to the minimum lot area
shall nevertheless apply. The figures specified in the tables of this Section are expressed in terms of square
feet, feet, or a ratio, whichever applies.
502.01. Conventional subdivisions. A conventional subdivision consists of single-family dwellings on
individual lots and requires no public or community open space.
A conventional subdivision is characterized by division of the entire subject parcel into lots. Table 5-1, Lot
Area, Setbacks and Maximum Impervious Surface and Parking Requirements for Conventional Subdivisions,
specifies the minimum standards for conventional single-family subdivision lots of various sizes. Table 5-2
provides development standards for conventional subdivisions in the Neighborhood Conservation (NC)

502.02. Performance Residential Developments. The purpose of a performance residential development
is to provide innovative development types that make efficient use of land and public facilities, and/or to
protect natural features addressed in Sections 412-417.
Performance residential developments may contain one or more of the housing types that are specified in this
subsection subject to the overall density standards established in Table 4-2. For purposes of calculating
density, the development site shall include all platted lots, together with road, drainage facilities, utility sites
and any other common property within the perimeter of the subdivision plat, regardless of whether or not
such facilities will ultimately be dedicated to the City. Such developments shall contain the minimum amount
of open space specified in Table 4-2. Prior to approving the final plat, the Planning Director shall verify that
all parcels or tracts not intended for use as residential lots are clearly delineated on the plat as to size and
dimension. The purpose, ownership, and responsibility for maintenance for each parcel or tract shall be noted
on the plat.
Unless specifically accepted by the City Council, the City of Auburn shall not be responsible for maintenance
and/or repair of any common facility or properties.
Performance residential developments shall be self-contained in terms of meeting the requirements of this
Ordinance. In addition to other relevant requirements, site plans and subdivision plats shall designate and
establish maintenance responsibility for all required recreation, resource protection, and other open space and
common properties within the development site. Where a performance residential development is to be built
in stages or will contain a mixture of land uses, a Master Development Plan shall be required.

V-12
The following subsections specify the standards and requirements for each dwelling type in detail.
A. Single-family detached house. This development type consists of a subdivision
containing freestanding single family dwelling units on individual lots.
Single family detached units in a performance subdivision shall not take access from an
arterial road. In addition to the bufferyard standards of Sections 420 through 428, single
family detached subdivisions shall meet the following development criteria:
Minimum Lot Area 5,000 s.f.
Maximum I.S.R. on
individual lots
.50
Maximum F.A.R. .35
Minimum Yards:
Front 20 ft.
Side 5 ft.*
Side on Street 15 ft.
Rear 20 ft.
Minimum Lot Width 50 ft.
Off-Street Parking Spaces 2
*or width of any easement along side lot line, whichever is greater
Sufficient open space shall be provided to protect any of the resource types specified in
Sections 412-417.
Note: Manufactured Home Subdivisions developed under performance residential
standards shall be subject to the same criteria as that set out above for single-family
detached house development.
V-13
B. Zero Lot Line. Under this development concept, each residential lot contains a dwelling
unit placed along one side lot line in order to maximize usable open area within the lot. All
zero lot line subdivision plats shall show driveways, walkways, patio slabs, and building
envelopes for all structures. No windows, doors, air conditioning units or other openings
or projections of any kind shall be permitted where the structure meets the side lot line.
However, a window may face the zero side yard if it is recessed at least five (5) feet from
the property line.
For each unit constructed along a side lot line, an easement of five (5) feet in width shall
be created on the adjoining property. The purpose of this easement is to permit
maintenance and repair of the portion of the structure bordering the zero side yard. All
maintenance easements shall be shown on the final plat, along with an indication of the lot
to which each easement is assigned. No fence, patio, deck, or structure of any kind shall
be placed within a maintenance easement.
Zero lot-line units shall not take access from an arterial road.
In addition to the bufferyard requirements of Sections 420 through 428, zero lot-line
subdivisions shall also meet the following development criteria:
Minimum Lot Area 4,500 s.f.
Maximum I.S.R. on
individual lots
.55

Section 503 Building Setbacks.
A. Minimum Setbacks. To calculate the minimum building setback required to ensure
adequate light, air, and privacy to abutting properties, multiply the height of the proposed
building by the Angle of Light Exposure Factor for the zoning district as shown below:
District
Angle of Light
Exposure Factor
DDH 1.0
MDRD 0.5
NRD 0.75
R 1.0
RDD 1.0
LDD 1.0
CDD 1.0
SCCD 1.0
V-23
The product of this calculation is the distance the building must be set back from the
property line. If, based on this calculation, the setback required is greater than the
minimum width of the required bufferyard, the setback according to the angle of light
exposure factor must be used. Also, note that the setback required by this calculation may
further restrict the setback requirements of Section 502.02 for performance housing types.
In all cases the most restrictive setback requirement must be used. This section shall not
apply to conventional subdivisions in any district.
B. Maximum Setbacks. Where lots have double frontage, the maximum setback shall apply
to the frontage upon any designated corridor (Section 429). For corner properties, the
maximum setback shall be measured from the property line of both rights-of-way. This
setback shall not be imposed upon frontage with public alleys or easements.
Recessed portions of any proposed structure, designed for outdoor seating, dining or events
shall be allowed under the requirements of this section following the review and approval
of the Planning Commission. Such recesses shall be clearly illustrated on the site plan.

property line or 25 feet from any adjacent structure, whichever is greater, provided that the distance
shall be increased by three (3) feet for each story of each structure in excess of two stories.
D. Building Setback and Height for the Urban Core (UC), College Edge Overlay District
(CEOD), and Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts.
For building setbacks in the Urban Core (UC) district see Section 507.
For building setbacks in the College Edge Overlay District (CEOD) see Section 508.
For building setbacks in the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S), districts see
Section 509.
Section 504. Planned Developments. A planned development is intended to encourage flexibility in siting,
mixtures of housing types and land uses, open space, and the preservation of significant natural features. The
goal is a development in which buildings, land use, transportation facilities, utility systems and open spaces
are integrated through an overall design. A planned development shall be permitted in a Planned
Development District (PDD) overlay district. The PDD overlay district is an additional zoning requirement
that is placed on a geographic area already zoned. The PDD designation can be requested and considered
only for properties already zoned as DDH, MDRD, CDD, LDD, NRD, RDD, CRD, and SCCD.
Property receiving a PDD designation shall be subject to the provisions of both the base zoning district and
the PDD. The base zone, which is the underlying zone, shall regulate the lot area, setback, bulk regulations,
parking, the maximum FAR and ISR, maximum gross density and the minimum open space ratio for
performance residential uses; and the minimum site area and lot width for nonresidential uses. The PDD
overlay zone shall regulate the permitted and conditional uses allowed; the mixed use development
components; and the maximum percentage of allowable dwelling units in a mixed commercial/residential
development.
Where provisions of the PDD and the zoning districts are in conflict, the provisions of the PDD shall govern.
V-24
504.01. Minimum Size and Ownership. A planned development shall consist of a minimum of ten (10)
acres. At the time of the application for PDD zoning, the entire tract of land for which rezoning is requested
shall be under unified control of a single individual, partnership or corporation.
504.02. Uses Permitted on Approval. All conditional uses set forth on Table 4-1 for PDD are allowed if
approved by City Council. Mixed-use developments are allowed within the Planned Development District
(PDD) and according to the following requirements:
A. The maximum gross density, minimum open space ratio and maximum density factor for
all planned developments shall be the same as the base district from which the site was
rezoned. The allowable figures for the Limited Development District (LDD) shall serve as
the minimum standard in all cases.
B. A mixed-use development in the Planned Development District may consist of: 1) any
commercial uses permitted in this district as set forth in Sections 402 and 408 of this
Ordinance, and 2) one or more dwelling units on the same development as the commercial
uses.
A Master Development Plan shall be required in connection with any request for PDD zoning.
504.03. Connection between uses and adjoining development. Connection between mixed use and
residential areas is required in order to provide cohesiveness in the overall development site. Cohesiveness
shall be provided through connectedness of land uses, streets, utilities, pedestrian and bicycle paths,
greenways, and signage. The design of any planned development or mixed use development should reflect
effort by the developer to plan land uses so as to blend harmoniously not only within the development site,
but with adjacent land uses to ensure compatibility, cohesiveness, and connectivity.
504.04. Changes to zoning ordinance. No amendments to this zoning ordinance relative to planned
development shall be effective to any PDD approval issued prior to such amendment, it being intended that
the PDD shall continue to be developed in accordance with the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of such
prior approval. (Amendments dated 5/02/06 pursuant to Ordinance Number 2389)
504.05. Development Incentives. Development incentives shall be provided to developers of qualified
planned development upon the written request. Incentive is the granting by the approving authority of
additional development capacity in exchange for a public benefit or amenity. Providing incentives is not just
beneficial for the developer, but to adjacent development, and the public. The need for incentives will vary
for different planned developments. Therefore, the allocation of incentives shall be determined on a case-bycase
basis. Incentives may include any of the following:
Incentive
Density Bonus: 10% increase in base zone density.
Density Bonus: 20% increase in base zone density*
Floor Area Ratio: An increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) for individual performance single-family
residential lots not to exceed 20% above the allowable FAR.
Reduced Setbacks: Reduction in front and side setback requirements for single-family residential uses as long
as the minimum front yard setback is at least ten (10) feet and no porch encroaches into this 10-foot front
setback. The side yards shall not be less than five feet.
The request for setback incentives shall not result in encroachment of any structures into a required landscaped
bufferyard, stream buffer or other environmentally sensitive areas.
V-25
Reduction in Minimum Lot Width: A reduction up to 20% in the minimum lot width for single-family detached
and zero lot line residential lots. No reduction shall be allowed for lots located in a cul-de-sac or along the
curvature of a street.
Master Signage Plan Approval: To expedite the sign permitting process, a Master Sign Plan can be submitted
depicting all proposed signage, in accordance with Section 606, for the planned development. Flexibility may
be granted by the Planning Director in the number, size, location, and height of the signs. Once approved, no
signs shall be erected on the site, except as shown on the approved Master Signage Plan. A Master
Development Plan may be amended by filing a new plan.
Accelerated Preliminary Plat Approval Process: To expedite the approval process, preliminary plats for
residential developments shall be approved administratively by staff. This incentive shall be contingent upon
findings by the staff that the preliminary plats are consistent with the approved Master Development Plan.
A public hearing for the preliminary plat will be held in conjunction with the public hearing for the
PDD/Master Development Plan approval process. In this case, the Master Development Plan will be referred
to as the Preliminary Master Development Plan. A Preliminary Master Development Plan shall be required
to contain more detailed information relative to the lot size and lot width of each residential lot.
Increase in ISR: An increase in the impervious surface ratio (ISR) for residential uses not to exceed 20%
above the allowable ISR. This incentive is not applicable to developments in the Lake Ogletree/Martin-
Marietta watersheds and any areas zoned for conservation subdivisions.
*The exchange for this incentive is predetermined. See asterisk* under Exchange.
Exchange
Open Space Improvements: Improvements to greenway/open space such as pedestrian paths, bike trails, and
street lighting along pedestrian paths and bike trails. Improvements must be approved by the Planning Director
and the Parks and Recreation Director.
*Housing for the Elderly and/or Low and Moderate Income: Provision of housing qualifying as elderly housing
or low and moderate income families in accordance with federal guidelines (See Economic Development).
Vegetated Buffer Along the Perimeter: A 20-foot wide undisturbed natural or landscaped buffer along the
perimeter of the development site. An undisturbed natural buffer/open space is an unimproved area that has
retained its natural character of trees, shrubs and ground covering. A landscaped buffer must meet the standards
for residential buffer landscaping requirements as cited in Section 422.03 of this Ordinance.
Increased Open Space: A 25% increase in open space beyond the minimum required open space for the
development site (required acreage of open space X 25%). The additional open space shall be comprised of
undisturbed natural open space. Vegetated buffers along the perimeter cannot count toward the increased open
space requirement. In addition, stream buffers, utility easements and other easements required by the City of
Auburn shall not count as open space under this incentive. Moreover, this exchange can be offered twice for
two incentives. For example, a developer can offer a 50% increase over the minimum required open space for
his development site in exchange for two incentives of his choice.
Park and Recreation Areas: A minimum of five acres of useable park space to be developed and maintained
primarily for both active and passive recreational pursuits, including but not limited to tot-lots, playgrounds,
neighborhood parks, and play fields. These five acres can be dispersed throughout the development site, as long
as the total acreage of park and recreational areas is equivalent to five acres.
Improvements shall not be permitted in the increased open space cited above but shall be permitted on the land
allocated to meet the minimum open space requirement under the base zone designation. Proposed
improvements must be approved by the Planning Director and Parks and Recreation Director. This exchange
cannot be offered in conjunction with the open space improvement unless approved by the Director of Parks and
V-26
Recreation. The parks and recreation areas must be owned and maintained by the developer and/or a
homeowners association.
Parking in the Rear for Multi-Family: Parking for multi-family development shall be located in the rear of the
buildings.
Parking in the Rear for Commercial/Office Use: Parking for commercial and office developments shall be
located in the rear of the buildings.
Limited Access: Access to single-family attached and detached dwellings shall be provided from alleys and/or
shared driveways.
Low Density Along the Edge: Lower density residential development along the perimeter of the development
site or adjacent to existing single-family residential development on adjoining properties. For the purpose of
this exchange, lower density residential is defined as a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet.
Dedicated Open Space: Land allocated and dedicated to the City for future parks and public greenways in
accordance with the Citys greenway/future park plan. The land must be dedicated after the PDD rezoning is
approved by the City Council and prior to the first preliminary plat submission.
No request for an incentive shall be accepted unless an exchange is offered. An exchange is a public benefit
or amenity provided by an applicant or developer for additional development capacity. The developer shall
have the option of choosing from the list the exchange to offer for the incentive.
A planned development shall be allowed only two development incentives. The entire area shown on a Master
Development Plan shall constitute a planned development site for the purpose of allocating incentives and
exchanges.
Requests for incentives and the reasons therefore shall be set forth by the applicant in the application for
PDD approval. The applicant shall explain in his request how each incentive would benefit, and not be
detrimental, to the public interest. The benefits derived from the exchange may not necessarily impact the
development itself.
No incentives may be allowed when the proposed modification would result in:
(1) Traffic volume exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in
the vicinity of the planned development.
(2) An undue burden on community facilities, such as schools, fire and police protection,
utilities, and other such facilities.
(3) Detrimental impact on surrounding land uses.
(4) Incompatibility with the goals of the Land Use Plan.
(5) Negative impact on the local watersheds.
Staff will review each request for incentive as requested and address the above findings in the staff report.
The burden of proof that these criteria are not being violated shall rest with the applicant and not the staff.
Development incentives, if granted, shall supersede the applicable regulations of the base and PDD zoning
districts of the planned development.
All incentives requested and exchanges offered relative to density bonuses, minimum lot width, open space,
perimeter buffer, parking and low density must be reflected on the proposed Master Development Plan as
V-27
presented to the Planning Commission or City Council for approval. Incentives shall become a component
of the Master Development Plan and shall be binding upon all future development on the site. Incentives
shall be subject to requirements pursuant to Sections 504.03, 504.04, 504.07 and 504.08.
Section 505. Master Development Plan.
A Master Development Plan is a conceptual drawing that provides for the coordinated development of a
specific area. A Master Development Plan shall be required if one or more of the following is proposed:
A. When any development site is to be developed in stages or phases, no plat or phase plan
for any fraction of the site shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum
gross density or less than the minimum required open space pursuant to Table 4-2, unless
a Master Development Plan is submitted (See Section 802.09)
B. When a request is made for Planned Development District (PDD) zoning.
C. For any development containing a mixture of residential and non-residential land uses over
five (5) acres in size or containing more than ten (10) dwelling units.
D. For any rezoning request relative to the village concept and activity centers.
E. For any development site comprising five acres or more in the Urban Neighborhood (UN),
Medium Density Residential District (MDRD), Neighborhood Redevelopment District
(NRD), and Corridor Redevelopment (CRD) districts.
Master Development Plans required for developments described in Subsections (A), (C), and (E) above shall
be submitted with the site plan, preliminary plat, or conditional use request. The Master Development Plan

relevant to evaluate the character and impact of the proposed planned development.
Certain informational requirements contained in this subsection may be waived upon a determination by the
Planning Director that they are not applicable or necessary to the proposed application.
Upon approval, the written report shall become a component of the Master Development Plan and shall be
binding upon all future development on the site.
505.02. Phasing and Staging the Master Development Plan.
Nothing within this Section precludes an applicant from delineating the development site into geographic
areas called phases. Each phase of a development shall be able to exist as an independent stable unit. The
phases shall be indicated by a numeric system or subdivision names. The phasing of a development site shall
in no way indicate the stages of development.
Staging is the timing and geographical sequence of development. The applicant may elect to develop the site
in successive stages in a manner consistent with the Master Development Plan. The Planning Commission
may require that the development be done in stages if public utilities are not adequate to service the entire
development initially.
The staging of a planned development shall consist of a development schedule indicating the approximate
date when construction of the various phases can be expected to begin and be completed. This schedule shall
show a steady progression toward completion of the project. If the planned development is expected to be
constructed in stages or according to phases during a period extending beyond a single construction season
(18 months), a development schedule shall be submitted with the Master Development Plan indicating:
(A) The approximate date when construction of the project can be expected to begin;
(B) The order and timing in which the phases of the project will be built and the estimated time
of completion of each phase;
(C) The land area, density, the approximate location of common open space and facilities, and
public improvements that will be required at each stage.
(D) The Planning Commission may require a planting schedule for landscaping and
bufferyards, which assures that these amenities are provided at substantially the same rate
as residential dwelling units.
The development schedule is a required component of the Master Development Plan that is not binding upon
the applicant but shall be used for informational purposes.
The Planning Commission may waive a development schedule upon submission of written justification by
the applicant.
505.03. Process for PDD and Master Development Plan Approval.
Pre-Application Conference. The applicant and/or his or her representatives are required to confer with the
Citys development staff prior to the submission of a PDD application, a mixed-use development plan or a
development plan involving stages of development or the village concept. Representatives from the Planning
Department, Water Resource Management, and Public Works shall attend. The purpose of the conference is
to exchange information and receive guidance concerning the process for approval and the provision of the
PDD zone.
V-30
Submission of the Application. An application for approval for a development site requiring a Master
Development Plan shall include: the application, the Master Development Plan (Section 504), the written
report (Section 504.01), staging of development schedule (Section 504.02) and required fees.
Planning Division Review and Recommendation: After the receipt of the application and all pertinent
attachments, the Planning Department shall prepare a staff report to the planning commission containing their
findings:
(A) As to the suitability of the site for the planned development zoning proposed and the
relation of the proposed development to the surrounding areas as it relates to existing and
probable future development;
(B) As to the suitability of proposed streets to adequately carry anticipated traffic, and whether
increased densities will generate traffic in such an amount as to overload the street network
outside the development site.
(C) As to access to utilities and proposed utility services that will be adequate for the population
densities proposed.
(D) As to proper justification for the development proposed, including commercial, and its
consistency with the Land Use Plan and adopted development policy of the City of Auburn.
(E) As to the impact the proposed development would have on local natural resources in the
general area.
(F) As to whether the applicant submitted the application and all relevant materials and
adequately addressed all the information required in the written report. The applicants
written report shall be submitted as part of the Planning Departments staff report.
(G) As to the proposed development compliance with this Ordinance, the Land Use Plan and
other plans, maps, and ordinance adopted by the City to guide its growth and development.
Based upon such findings, the Planning Department shall recommend to the planning commission approval,
approval with conditions, or disapproval of the Master Development Plan and the rezoning, if the application
is a request for a PDD.
Action by the Planning Commission. Following the receipt of the Planning Department staff report, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and review staffs report along with the Master
Development Plan. The Planning Commission shall recommend to the city council either approval of the
Master Development Plan as proposed, approval subject to conditions and modifications, or denial with
reasons therefor.
City Council Review and Approval. After receipt of the recommendation from the Planning Commission,
the City Council shall hold a public hearing and render a decision on any Master Development Plan and any
request for rezoning, if the application is a request for a PDD. The City Council shall approve, approve with
conditions set forth by the Planning Commission, approve with conditions or modifications imposed by City
Council, or deny the Master Development Plan.
505.04. Reapplication if Denied. If a request for Master Development Plan approval is denied, the matter
cannot be reopened or be the subject of a new request for at least one year unless the conditions have changed
significantly from the first time it was heard. A request for re-hearing less than one year from the date of the
initial hearing must include evidence that the conditions pertinent to the case have changed significantly. If
after reviewing the request, the Planning Commission is convinced that there has been significant change,
then a new application shall be filed.
V-31
505.05. Conditional Use Approval and the Plan. Approval of the Master Development Plan shall
constitute conditional use approval for performance residential uses as set forth in the Master Development
Plan and in accordance with the PDD zoning district on Table 4-1. Nonresidential uses in a planned or
mixed-use development are subject to a separate conditional use approval process by the Planning
Commission and City Council prior to an application for a zoning certificate.
505.06. Density and Open Space Standards for Individual Stages. A Master Development Plan shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission prior to or simultaneously with any regular site plan or
subdivision plat submitted. Upon approval of the Master Development Plan, the developer may submit and
the Planning Commission may approve subdivision plats or site plans for individual phases or stages.
Where any development site is to be developed in stages, no plat or phase plan for any fraction of the site
shall be accepted for review which has more than the maximum gross density or less than the minimum
required open space as shown in this section.
No individual stage shall exceed the following density or fail to meet the minimum open space percentage:
Zoning District Maximum
Density*
(Units/Acre)
Minimum Open
Space (Percent)
CDD 14 15
LDD 7.5 20
DDH 8 15
MDRD 16 10
NRD 12 15
RDD 24 10
CRD-U 20 10
CRD-S 14 15
CRD-W 14 10
CRD-E 16 10
*Refer to Tables 4-1, 5-1, 5-2 and Section 502.02 for
density requirements for other zoning districts not listed
When submitting a plat for individual stages or phases of development, the applicant must submit a boundary
survey for that stage of the development.
505.07. Changes or Modification to the Plan. Once approved, the Master Development Plan shall become
a binding condition of development on the site, and subsequent stages or phases of the development shall be
substantially consistent with it. Approval of such plan shall bind the applicant, owner and mortgagee or any
subsequent ownership interest, if any, with respect to the contents of such plan.
If the Planning Director finds that any stage or phase plan substantially deviates from the approved Master
Development Plan, a new master plan shall be required for Planning Commission review prior to approval
of further site plans or subdivision plats within the development.
Any of the following changes shall constitute a substantial deviation:
A. An increase or reduction in land area of the development.
B. An increase in the total number of dwelling units.
V-32
C. Provision of less than the required percentage of recreation, resource protection, or open
space land.
D. Proposal of single family attached, duplex, multi-family or zero lot-line development in
place of approved single family detached housing.
E. Any significant addition, removal or rearrangement of land uses or streets.
505.08. Termination of Approved Plan. Implementation of the Master Development Plan must commence
within the 24 months following approval. Commencement of a Plan shall mean the recording of a final plat
covering at least a portion of the development site. Recognizing that conditions may change during extended
periods of time to such an extent that approved plans for a planned development may not be in the public
interest, failure to actively pursue an authorized planned development shall automatically reverse the
rezoning and the property shall revert to its prior zoning designation, and the Master Development Plan will
no longer be valid. In cases where the PDD approval was accompanied by a base zone rezoning (i.e., from
Rural to any eligible PDD base zone, for example), the base zone shall also revert to its prior zoning
designation.
Section 506. Mixed-Used Developments.
506.01. Purpose. Developments, other than those within a Planned Development District (PDD), which

the main entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear
foot of building or space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, whichever is
greater, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Other building facades may
have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building
width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet.
Multi-story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have the
main entrance may have one (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot
of building or space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is greater,
but no more than seventy five (75) square feet. Other building facades may

width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square feet.
Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet
can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has
a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod
extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging sign suspended from
V-36
Signage (continued) it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street ROW. Blade signs are to
be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the
blade sign. Text and graphics on either or both ends of an awning that are
oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are no more
than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign.
All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line, or
between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall. The
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate location
for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause damage to
architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building signs may not
be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the primary sign is
computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle,
within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed.
A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for
placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised,
and is generally two (2) sided. Sandwich board signs that meet all of the

f. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other
sandwich board sign.
Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make
it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing
requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an
alternative location that maximizes distance between adjacent signs.
Balconies
A license agreement shall be required for any balcony projection into the rightof-
way. The license agreement must be approved prior to construction release
or issuance of a building permit. Application for any balcony encroachment

Signage Building signs and sandwich board signs as defined in Article VI are the only
signs that are allowed in the CEOD. Signs may be attached to any building
façade. In a multi-tenant building, the building owner is responsible for
distributing the sign allowance among the tenants.
Electronic reader boards are prohibited in the CEOD.
Single story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have
the main entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear
foot of building or space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, whichever is
greater, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Other building facades may
have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building
width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet.
V-39
Multi-story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have the
main entrance may have one (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot
of building or space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is greater,
but no more than seventy five (75) square feet. Other building facades may
have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building
width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square feet.
Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet
can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has
a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod
extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging sign suspended from
it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street ROW. Blade signs are to
be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the
blade sign. Text and graphics on either or both ends of an awning that are
oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are no more
than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign.
All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line, or
between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall. The
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate location
for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause damage to
architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building signs may not
be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the primary sign is
computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle,
within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed.
A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for
placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised,
and is generally two (2) sided. Sandwich board signs that meet all of the
following criteria may be placed and displayed on a public sidewalk:
a. A height of no more than four (4) feet;
b. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet;
c. No illumination;
d. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business hours
respective to the use in the building or leased space;
e. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and,
f. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other
sandwich board sign.
Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make
it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing
requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an
alternative location that maximizes distance between adjacent signs.
Balconies
A license agreement shall be required for any balcony projection into the rightof-
way. The license agreement must be approved prior to construction release
or issuance of a building permit. Application for any balcony encroachment
must be made to both the Planning Director and the City Engineer for review,
and the format of the license shall be determined and approved by the City
Attorney. Official approval of such agreement shall be by resolution of the
City Council.
Buildings with balconies must have covenants that prohibit leaving unsightly
debris, clothing, banners or other materials visible from public view.
Enforcement of covenants shall be the responsibility of the Homeowners or
Condominium Association.
V-40
Awnings and Canopies
Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed. Awnings fabricated of canvas
or metal are allowed. Awnings may be placed above and extend the width of
any door or window, or extend up to 75% of the width of the building façade
along the street line, whichever is greater; and must be supported from the
building façade with suspension rods.
Support structures for awnings or canopies cannot extend from the sidewalk.
Awnings slopes may be flat to 45 degrees maximum and may not exceed 5 feet
in vertical height.

for determining the total of units allowed. The open space calculation shall be
divided equally among and attached to each lot. This minimum open shall be
designated on the subdivision plat and shall not be used for the placement of
any structures or parking.
Example: For a single-family performance residential, the minimum lot size is
5,000 s.f.
22,000 s.f. x 0.15 = 3300
22,000  3300 = 18,700
18,700 ÷ 5,000 = 3.74 lots.
The maximum number of lots allowed would be 3. The minimum amount of
open to be added to each lot would be 1,100 s.f.
Parking Requirement See Section 513 for parking requirement.
Parking Lot Screening

Signage (continued)
Single story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have
the main entrance may have one (1) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear
foot of building or space width, or sixteen (16) square feet, whichever is
greater, but no more than fifty (50) square feet. Other building facades may
have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building
width, but no more than fifty (50) square feet.
Multi-story building - Building facades that face a public street or that have the
main entrance may have one (2) square feet of sign area for each (1) linear foot
of building or space width or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is greater,
but no more than seventy five (75) square feet. Other building facades may
have one-half (0.5) square foot of sign area for each (1) linear foot of building
width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square feet.
Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square feet
can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade that has
a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an ornamental rod
extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging sign suspended from
it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street ROW. Blade signs are to
be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the
blade sign. Text and graphics on either or both ends of an awning that are
oriented perpendicular to the building face for pedestrian view and are no more
than six (6) square feet may be provided in lieu of a blade sign.
All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line, or
between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall. The
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate location
for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause damage to
architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building signs may not
be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the primary sign is
computed by measuring the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle,
within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed.
A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for
placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being advertised,
and is generally two (2) sided. Sandwich board signs that meet all of the
following criteria may be placed and displayed on a public sidewalk:
a. A height of no more than four (4) feet;
b. Maximum area of any side is eight (8) square feet;
c. No illumination;
d. Placed in front of the building or leased space during business hours
respective to the use in the building or leased space;
e. Maintains a clearance on the sidewalk of at least five (5) feet; and,
f. Maintains a distance of at least twenty (20) feet from any other
sandwich board sign.
Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side make
it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich board spacing
requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an
alternative location that maximizes distance between adjacent signs.
Awnings and Canopies
Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed. Awnings fabricated of canvas
or metal are allowed. Awnings may be placed above and extend the width of
any door or window, or extend up to 75% of the width of the building façade
along the street line, whichever is greater; and must be supported from the
building façade with suspension rods.

that particular frontage. If the Planning Director determines that the
requirements of the street tree master plan cannot be met, the general
landscaping requirements of Section 422 must be met.
Side and rear bufferyards may be reduced or waived by the Planning
Director if the adjoining uses are similar in nature or if the buildings are
built in a continuous urban form that would be interrupted by a greenspace.
Decks, porches, balconies and pedestrian areas, including plazas, street
arcades, courtyards, and outdoor cafes may extend into bufferyards. In no
case shall the encroachment exceed 60 percent of the length of the property
line of the particular bufferyard.

(1) linear foot of building width, but no more than seventy-five (75) square
feet.
Blade signs are encouraged and a blade sign not exceeding six (6) square
feet can be provided in addition to building mounted signage on any façade
that has a sidewalk or entrance. A blade mounted sign is defined as an
ornamental rod extending perpendicular from the building with a hanging
sign suspended from it at a 90-degree angle from building face and street
ROW. Blade signs are to be placed a minimum of nine (9) feet above
sidewalk level to the bottom of the blade sign. Text and graphics on either
or both ends of an awning that are oriented perpendicular to the building
face for pedestrian view and are no more than six (6) square feet may be

All building signs must be mounted between the first and second floor line,
or between the second and third floor line or near the top of the wall. The
Planning Director, or appropriate designee, may approve an alternate
location for a sign in cases where these locations conflict with or may cause
damage to architectural ornamentation of a building. In any case, building
signs may not be mounted higher than the building. Signage area for the
primary sign is computed by measuring the number of square feet in the
smallest rectangle, within all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of
the sign can be enclosed.
A sandwich board sign is a sign of A-frame construction designed for
placement on the sidewalk in front of the place of business being
advertised, and is generally two (2) sided. Sandwich board signs that

sandwich board sign.
Where adjacent buildings are narrow and sign placements on either side
make it impossible for a building owner or tenant to meet the sandwich
board spacing requirement, the Planning Director, or appropriate
designee, may approve an alternative location that maximizes distance
between adjacent signs.
Awnings and Canopies
Sloped or flat awnings and canopies are allowed. Awnings fabricated of
canvas or metal are allowed. Awnings may be placed above and extend
the width of any door or window, or extend up to 75% of the width of the

Runway Protection Zone, and Airport Noise Impact Zone as they apply to the airport. Such zones are shown
on the Auburn University Regional Airport Zone Map, consisting of one sheet, prepared by Charles Mosley
and dated September 11, 2009. This map is attached to this Ordinance and made a part hereof. The map
referred to in this Section is on file in the Planning Department.
These airport zones shall be superimposed over existing zoning districts and the special requirements of these
airport zoning regulations shall apply in addition to the requirements of the district within which a specific
property is located (See Article IV).
516.04. Area of Jurisdiction. In order to protect the approaches of said airport, the jurisdiction of this
Section of the ordinance is extended to all areas depicted on the Auburn University Regional Airport Map,
including areas within the City of Auburn.
516.05. Airport overlay zones. The City of Auburn hereby adopts three (3) airport overlay zones which are
shown on the City zoning map. These zones are established to regulate development in proximity to the
airport. The location of these overlay zones is hereby established by this section. Boundaries of these zones
may be changed only by way of an amendment of the official zoning map, pursuant to this section of the
zoning ordinance. All development applications for land within these overlay zones shall comply with the
airport zoning regulations of this section. In addition, development within these airport overlay zones shall
also comply with applicable underlying zoning district requirements as referenced in this zoning ordinance.
The three airport overlay zones are as follows:
A. Airport Height Notification Zone (Subzone A and Subzone B);
B. Airport Runway Protection Zone; and
C. Airport Noise Impact Zone (½ of longest planned runway).
Where an airport overlay zone overlays a portion of a property, only that portion within the zone shall be
affected by the zone regulations. Furthermore, in relation to applying runway protection zone and noise
impact zone requirements, use regulations shall apply to the structure or facilities constituting the use and
shall generally apply to accessory open space, landscape and buffering, stormwater management, or driveway
and parking uses.
516.06. Airport height notification zone and regulations.
A. Establishment of zone. The airport height notification zone is hereby established as an overlay zone on
the adopted City zoning map. This zone is established to regulate the height of structures and natural
vegetation for areas in proximity to the public use airports located within the City of Auburn. The airport
height notification zone, consists of two subzones, is defined as:
Subzone A. The area surrounding each public use airport extending outward twenty
thousand (20,000) feet from the ends and each side of all active runways.
Subzone B. The area outside of Subzone A.
B. Airport height definition. For the purposes of determining building height in the height notification zone,
height shall be measured in feet above ground level, rounded to the highest foot. The total structure
height shall include anything mounted on top of the structure, such as antennas, obstruction lights,
lightning rods, etc.
C. Height notification regulations. All applicants of development proposals for land within the height
notification zone determined to be a potential airport obstruction shall forward a notice of proposed
V-77
construction (form 7460) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be reviewed for conformance
with the obstructions standards detailed in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77 Subpart C. (14
CFR Part 77), as may be amended from time to time.
1. A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport
obstruction" if the proposed development would result in a structure or natural
vegetation having a height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward
and upward from the ends and sides of a public use airport active runway at a
slope of one (1) foot vertical to one hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to
twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A or two hundred (200) feet above
ground level for Subzone B. Applicants of any development proposal determined
by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes a "potential airport
obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during the
development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his designee.
No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for
construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is
determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport
construction permit is granted.
2. Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport
obstruction" is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting
regulations contained herein.
3. Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval. Any applicant
affected by a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director
for an airport construction permit.
a. Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit.
i. Applicants shall submit to the planning division a
completed airport construction permit application form (as provided by
the City) and a copy of the notice of proposed construction form
submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit requests may be considered
by the Planning Director concurrent with development plan approval
consideration.
ii. Prior to permit requests being considered for approval,
applicants shall submit to the planning division the final determination
issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of
proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77.
b. Criteria for granting an airport construction permit.
i. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development
and determined its construction would not exceed an obstruction
standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the Planning Director shall grant a airport
construction permit for the proposed development provided that a
condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure that the approved
structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy (C.O.) if so required by Chapter 14-60, in accordance with
the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal
Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended.
ii. Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and
determined that the proposed development exceeds the obstruction
V-78
standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no airport construction permit may be
approved, and a City airport obstruction variance (see Section 907.04)
must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to
proceed.
A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an
airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these
regulations or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a
permit is made.
516.07. Airport runway protection zone and regulations.
A. Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City
zoning map a runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be
amended from time to time. Within a runway protection zone, certain uses are restricted or
prohibited to reduce incompatibilities with normal airport operations and danger to public health.
B. Runway protection zone regulations.
1. Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within the runway
protection zone:
a. Educational centers (including all types of primary and
secondary schools, pre-schools, child care facilities).
b. Hospitals, freestanding emergency care centers,
nursing/convalescent home facilities.
c. Assembly halls.
d. Fuel storage facilities (excludes storage tanks for flammable
and combustible liquids, compressed gasses, or liquefied
petroleum gas necessary for the operation of medical
facilities)
2. Permitted uses. Any use which is not prohibited in a runway protection zone as
determined in a. above, is permitted within the runway protection zone, subject to
compliance with applicable airport noise impact zone, airport height notification
zone and zoning district regulations.
516.08. Airport noise impact zone and regulations.
A. Zone establishment. There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City
zoning map an airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport. The airport noise impact
zone is an area in which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and
alteration, moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced
by continuation of normal airport operations. The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows:
An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned runway
on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. For land use control purposes, this
boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to seventy (70) level day night
(ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or other recognized study, such as an
Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed.
B. Noise impact zone regulations. Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration,
moving, repair and use of any building or structure within the airport noise impact zone.
V-79
1. Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the noise impact
zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding recommended amounts of
noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as established by this Ordinance as
well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be achieved.
516.09. Nonconforming Uses.
1. Regulations not Retroactive. These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the
effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use.
Nonconforming vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 516.12.6.
2. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport, Federal Aviation Administration, or
State of Alabama, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
obstructions in accordance with FAA requirements. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated,
and maintained at the owners expense.
3. Expansion of a Nonconforming Use. Any existing nonconforming use as described in these
regulations shall not be expanded by altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in
any way its hazard within the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off or to increase
the potential hazard to persons assembled within a structure so located and used.
516.10. Permits. An applicant seeking development approval in an area within the airport overlay zones
shall provide the following information in addition to any other information required in the permit
application:
a. A map or drawing showing the location of the property in relation to the runway
protection zone, height notification zone and noise impact zone. The City of
Auburn Planning Department shall provide the applicant with the appropriate base
maps on which to locate the property.
b. Ground elevation profiles, a site plan, both drawn to scale, including the location
(X and Y coordinates) and total height of all existing and proposed structures,
measured in feet above the mean sea level.
c. If a height variance is requested, the applicant will need to obtain a letter
of support from the Airport.
516.11. Enforcement. The enforcement of this Section shall be subject to the powers and duties specified
under Article IX of the zoning ordinance except as otherwise stated in this Section. The Planning Director
and the Official Building Inspector shall coordinate the enforcement of this Section with the Airport. It shall
be the duty of the Airport to advise the Planning Director and the Official Building Inspector of any violations
of this Section.
Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not
more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a
separate offense.
Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the City of Auburn Planning Department upon a
form published for this purpose. Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall be promptly
considered and approved or denied. Applications for variances by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be
transmitted by the Planning Director.
V-80
516.12. Special Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the
City of Auburn shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport. The
following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that attract or
sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly increase the potential for
wildlife-aircraft collisions.
1. The distance between the Airports aircraft movement areas, loading ramps, or aircraft
parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet. A distance of
5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife
movement into or across the approach or departure airspace.
For additional information please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation
Federal Aviation Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having
the potential to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports.
2. Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1
activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport.
3. Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e. garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly
licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000
feet of the Airports runways.
4. Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g. construction demolition waste, automobile
junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally considered
incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered aircraft. However,
depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site investigation, and the proposed
location relative to the runway approach/departure paths, certain types of restricted
nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-objectionable off airport, provided
assurances are obtained from the proponent, and included in the licensing process, that
should the site cause an increase in bird activity which might be hazardous to safe aircraft
operations, action will be taken to mitigate the hazard or close the site.
5. Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other visual
hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation signals are
subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as may be
applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments.
6. Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast
approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces.
Section 517. Flag Lots. A flag lot is a lot that has minimal frontage on a publicly owned and maintained
street, whose width some distance back from the street boundary line meets all Ordinance requirements. The
purpose of flag lots is to reduce the number of direct access points to arterial and collector roads. Flag lots
may be permitted, even though they do not meet the minimum lot width requirements at the street boundary
line, subject to the following conditions:
A. Flag lots shall be limited to single family residential use only. No more than one (1)
dwelling unit shall be authorized for any one (1) flag lot access strip.
B. A flag lot may be used within a subdivision to provide a lot fronting on an arterial or
collector road with access to an internal subdivision street. In such cases, vehicular access
to the lot from the arterial or collector shall be prohibited. In any event, no more than 10
percent of the lots in any subdivision may be approved as flag lots.
C. Flag lots providing access to arterial or collector roads shall be prohibited.
V-81
D. Flag lot stems or access strips shall be at least 25 feet in width as measured at the road
frontage. The land area within the access strip shall not count toward the following
required minimum lot sizes:
District Minimum Lot Size
Rural (R) 3 acres
Neighborhood Conservation (NC) 40,000 square feet, or
greater if required by
district sub-designation
Redevelopment (RDD) 20,000 square feet
Comprehensive Development (CDD) 40,000 square feet
Limited Development (LDD) 40,000 square feet
Development District Housing (DDH) 40,000 square feet
E. Where otherwise consistent with the provisions of this section, flag lots may be created in
groups not exceeding two (2); in such cases, access strips shall be adjacent to each other
and form a total width of 50 feet. A distance of 500 feet shall separate non-adjacent flag
lot access strips on the same side of the road. All access strips shall be at least 25 feet from
an intersection.
F. The Planning Director shall identify the front, side and rear lot lines of a flag lot for
determining yard requirements, allowable locations of accessory structures, and other
purposes.

D. Freestanding Signs in the Urban Core, Urban Neighborhood Districts, and Corridor
Redevelopment Districts  East (CRD-E) and West (CRD-W) east of North Donahue
Drive. Existing freestanding signs, at the time of adoption of this ordinance (04/02/2019),
are allowed to remain in the Urban Core (UC), Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and
UN-S) districts, and Corridor Redevelopment Districts  East (CRD-E) and West (CRDW),
east of North Donahue Drive. However, should any changes be made or are requested
to be made to the existing sign, the sign must meet the following requirements.
Freestanding signs in the Urban Core (UC), Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UNS),
and Corridor Redevelopment Districts  East (CRD-E) and West (CRD-W) east of
North Donahue Drive districts are limited to an area of 32 square feet and shall not exceed
eight (8) feet in height. All structural elements of the sign must be covered entirely with
materials that correspond to the building materials and to the materials listed in the Urban
Core District Development and Design Standards (See Section 507.02), such as but not
limited to brick, limestone, or stucco. In addition, freestanding signs in the UN Districts
and CRD-E and W (east of North Donahue Drive) shall meet the requirements of Section
429. Such signs shall have a minimum setback of ten (10) feet from any side lot line and
ten (10) feet from the front or any street property line. No portion of a freestanding sign
shall project into the public right-of-way.
605.02. Menu Boards. A permanent sign, which is not designed or located so as to be legible from any
public right-of-way, depicting products that can be purchased on the property for which it is located (i.e. fast

the size does not count against the allowable square footage of a freestanding sign.
605.03. Subdivision Identification Marker. A sign marking an entrance from a perimeter road to a
residential subdivision, office park, or industrial park. Subdivision markers may be a single sign or a pair of
signs. A subdivision marker shall contain no advertising other than the name of the residential subdivision,
office park, or industrial park. No subdivision marker shall be located within the public right of way and
must be within the perimeter of the subdivision. If such sign is to be placed within a dedicated drainage or
utility easement, a hold harmless agreement must be sought from the City Engineer and/or the Water
Resource Management Director, prior to the issuance of a sign permit. Size shall be limited to 100 square
feet in total display area at each entrance from a perimeter road and shall be ground-mounted or monument
style.
605.04. Building Signs. Building signs on any single development site shall not exceed a total of two (2)
square feet per linear foot of the main or entry facade. Multi-story structures with outside entrances to
VI-12
businesses on each floor may multiply the allowable building signage area by the number of floors. Multistory
buildings with interior entrances and hotel/motel businesses are not allowed to apply the multiplier.
Building signs on development sites located in the Urban Core (UC), the College Edge Overlay (CEOD), the
Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) districts, and the Corridor Redevelopment District  West
(CRD-W) east of North Donahue Drive, shall be governed under the regulations as set forth in Section 507,
Section 508, Section 509, and Section 510, respectively. Prorating of allowable building signage amongst

Section 606. Master Signage Plan.
606.01. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to offer incentives to sign users particularly on
larger sites or groups of sites to plan and design signs that are compatible with the buildings on the
site thus enhancing the appearance of the site and of the streetscape that includes it. This section
sets out specific criteria for review and incentives for compliance. Consideration of design issues
necessarily requires some exercise of judgment within the specific criteria set out in this section, but
decisions rendered by utilizing these review criteria shall be objective.
606.02. Applicability. A Master Signage Plan may be submitted for any shopping center, multi-tenant
commercial/retail development, business park, industrial park, or mixed-use development located
in any of the following zoning districts: South College Corridor District (SCCD), Corridor
Redevelopment District (CRD-U and CRD-S), Comprehensive Development District (CDD),
Limited Development District (LDD)*, and the Planned Development District (PDD).
* Neighborhood Shopping Centers Only
606.03. Procedure. All Master Signage Plans shall be processed in accordance with the following
procedure:
A. A written application meeting all requirements, as set forth in this Section, shall be

after having followed the re-hearing provisions set forth by the Planning Commission.
606.04. Submission Requirements. The application for approval of a Master Signage Plan shall contain at
least the following information. Where the application is submitted simultaneously with an
application for site plan approval, or where there is an approved site plan for the area for which the
VI-13
application for a Master Signage Plan is filed the Master Signage Plan may refer to portions of the
site plan application or approved site plan for related requirements.
A. An accurate site plan of the development site at such scale as the Planning Director may
reasonably require;
B. A proposed design plan showing signage design at a scale of ½ = 1 ft;
C. Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such development
site;
D. Computation of the maximum area of all signs, the height of signs, and the number of
detached signs allowed on the development site including incentives authorized below;
E. Listing of the materials proposed for all sign structures and sign surfaces;
F. Listing of the proposed style and color pallet for all signs (e.g., letter colors, background
colors, and text font);
G. An accurate indication on the site plan of the proposed location of each present and future
sign of any type requiring a permit;
H. The Master Signage Plan shall be signed by all owners or their authorized agents.
606.05. Amendments. A Master Signage Plan may be amended by filing a new Master Signage Plan that
conforms to all requirements of this section in effect at the time of submittal. Any such amendment
shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.
606.06. Provisions for Nonconforming Signs. A Master Signage Plan for a property already containing
signs on the date of submission of the application shall include a schedule for bringing all signs on
the development site into conformance with the Master Signage Plan by a specified date. The
conformance schedule included in such Master Signage Plan shall be considered a condition of
approval of the Master Signage Plan.
606.07. Incentives. To encourage the use of Master Signage Plans, and thus to improve the appearance of
signage within individual projects, the following incentives which involve deviations from the
regulations that would otherwise apply in Article VI of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply:
A. The area shown on the Master Signage Plan shall all be considered on-premises for
purposes of determining whether a sign is off-premises;
B. The sign size and area for any freestanding sign (other than monument signs) may be
increased to 120% of the sign size and area that would otherwise be allowed in accordance
with Article VI;
C. The sign size and area for any monument sign may be increased to 130% of the sign size
and area that would otherwise be allowed in accordance with Article VI.
Section 607. Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Signs.
607.01. Compliance with Building and Electrical Code Requirements. All permanent signs and the
illumination thereof, shall be designed, constructed and maintained in conformity with the applicable
provisions of the International Building Code adopted by the City of Auburn. All freestanding signs must
have a clearance from the Building and Codes Inspection Division prior to the issuance of a sign permit by
the Planning Department. Wherever there is inconsistency between this Ordinance and the building or
electrical code, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.
VI-14
607.02. Illumination Standards.
A. Sign lighting shall not be designed or located to cause confusion with traffic signal or
similar warning signs.
B. Devices that illuminate a sign or signs shall be placed and shielded so that direct light shall

be setback at least ten (10) feet from all side lot lines and any lot line adjacent to a public
right-of-way.
B. No freestanding sign shall be located in a public drainage or utility easement without
written permission, in the form of a hold harmless agreement, from the City Engineer
and/or the Water Resource Management Director prior to the issuance of a sign permit.
Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the
display area shall be the area of one sign face. Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed
from a single location or has an angle greater that 45 degrees, the display area of all such faces shall be
included in determining the total display area of the sign.
607.04. Calculation of Display Area. The display area of a sign or advertising device is measured by the
smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the entire sign or
advertising device; excluding trim, frame, apron, posts, uprights, braces or other structural members which
support it.
Where a sign is double facing and only one face can be viewed from a single location on a roadway, the
display area shall be the area of one sign face. Where a sign has two (2) or more faces that can be viewed
from a single location, the display area of all such faces shall be included in determining the total display
area of the sign.
Open-lettered sign display area shall be measured by the number of square feet in the smallest rectangle,
within which all letters, logos, symbols or other elements of the sign can be enclosed, multiplied by a factor
of 0.8.
When a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be determined by drawing a square,
rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof, which will encompass the projected image of the sign and
multiplying that area by two (2). The projected image is that image created by tracing the largest possible
two-dimensional outline of the sign.
607.05. Relationship to Building Features.
A. Signs mounted to the structural roof or applied to the roof including painted signs are
prohibited.
B. Window signs are exempt.
C. Interior signs displayed in a manner that they are visible from a public right-of-way or
adjoining properties are prohibited. (See also Window Signs).

lighting fixtures, and all painted and display areas, shall be maintained in accordance with the International
Building Code adopted by the City of Auburn. All signs and their components shall be maintained in good
repair, free of rust, peeling, fading, broken or cracked panels, and broken or missing letters. Vegetation must
be properly maintained and no condition shall be allowed that would constitute a fire, safety, or health hazard.
607.07. Abandoned Signs.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, any sign or sign structure identifying a
previous use or activity that has not occupied the site for a period greater than sixty (60)
days, does not maintain a current business license or pertains to a time, event or purpose
which no longer applies, shall be deemed abandoned. Any abandoned sign shall be
prohibited and shall be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner of the property
within 60 days. The removal of a frame of an abandoned sign shall not be required, if it
conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations (including the sign face area
for sign replacement yielded by such frame).
B. Any sign structure, which supported or supports an abandoned sign and which structure
conforms to all applicable terms contained in these regulations shall be allowed to remain
in place. However, in the event a sign structure which supported or supports an abandoned
sign is inconsistent with any term contained in these regulations (including the sign face
area for sign replacement yielded by the frame), then the sign structure and frame shall be
either altered to comply with the terms contained herein or removed by the owner of such
structure or property.
Section 608. Permitting and Enforcement/Administration.
608.01. Permits for Permanent Signs.
A. Applicability. No person shall erect, alter, relocate, repair, replace the face of, or change
a sign without first obtaining a permit, except for the following actions which shall not

requisite documentation and fees accompany the application form, will accept the
application. The application shall include supplementary information as may be
specifically requested by the Planning Department to determine compliance with
these regulations.
2. The Planning Department shall review the application, plans, and specifications
to determine whether the proposed sign conforms to all applicable requirements

VI-16
permit. In case of denial, the Planning Department shall specify the section or
sections of these regulations with which the proposed sign is not in conformance.
4. An application may be amended within thirty (30) days of the application date to
include additional signs. Additional fees shall be charged if the additional signs

5. Freestanding signs will require a footing inspection by the Building and Codes
Inspection Division unless such inspection is specifically waived by an Inspector.
6. Failure to obtain a permit prior to installing, changing, or erecting a sign shall
result in the doubling of the permit fee.

schedule of fees established by the Auburn City Council for the particular
category of application. This fee is nonrefundable irrespective of the final
disposition of the application.
4. A sign permit shall be valid for a period of 180 days after issuance. Failure to
install the sign within the allotted time period shall void the permit and necessitate
reapplication.

ARTICLE VII. NONCONFORMITIES.
Section 700. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of legal uses, structures,
lots, and signs established either prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or the effective date of future amendments to
this Ordinance that no longer conform to the requirements of this Ordinance. All such situations are collectively referred
to as "nonconformities."
The zoning regulations established by this Ordinance are designed to guide the future use of land in the City of Auburn
by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses, and thus, to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for
which such regulations are established, and thus, the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
With limited exceptions, the regulations of this article permit such nonconformities to continue without specific
limitation of time, but are intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent.
While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in
nonconformities to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this
Ordinance and the character of the City. Any nonconforming use, structure, lot, or sign that lawfully existed as of the
effective date of this Ordinance and that remains nonconforming, and any use, structure, lot, or sign that becomes
nonconforming as a result of any subsequent rezoning or amendment to the text of this Ordinance, may be continued or
maintained only in accordance with the terms of this chapter. This chapter also is intended to reduce vacancies, promote
appropriate redevelopment and reuse of existing structures and lots, and set forth requirements.
This Article distinguishes nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures, nonconforming development sites,
nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming manufactured home parks, and nonconforming signs. Different regulations
are made applicable to each of these categories. The degree of restriction made applicable to each separate category is a
function of the degree to which that category of nonconformity is a nuisance or incompatible with the purposes and
regulations of this Ordinance.
Section 701. Definitions.
701.01. A legal nonconformity is any land use or physical design of development, structure, sign, or lot of record legally
established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which would not be permitted by
or is not in full compliance with the regulations of this Ordinance.
701.02. A nonconforming use is an activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for purposes which were legally
established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, and which would not be permitted
to be established as a new use in a zone in which it is located by the regulations of this Ordinance. Once changed to a
conforming use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
701.03. A nonconforming structure is any building or structure, other than a sign, legally established prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it, which does not fully comply with the standards of this
Ordinance.
701.04. A nonconforming development site is any development site, legally established prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance or subsequent amendment to it and part of an approved site plan or subdivision plat at the time of its
establishment, which does not fully comply with the standards of this Ordinance, including the minimum acceptable
bufferyard requirements of Section 714. Noncompliance with the bufferyard requirements of Section 420 through
Section 432 requires compliance with Section 714, but does not render a development site nonconforming.
701.05. A nonconforming lot of record is any validly recorded lot meeting the requirements of § 711.03 of the Zoning
Ordinance, which at the time it was recorded fully, complied with all applicable laws and ordinances, but which does not
fully comply with the lot requirements of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum
street frontage.
VII-1
701.06. A nonconforming sign is any sign legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent
amendment to it which does not fully comply with all requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance.
Section 702. Determination of Nonconforming Status.
702.01. The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of any structure or land use under the terms of this Article,
in all cases, shall be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the City of Auburn.
702.02. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of an existing nonconformity are permitted but such
nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
702.03. This chapter shall not apply, however, to any development standard or feature that is the subject of a variance or
waiver granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment, Historic Preservation Commission, Planning Commission, or City
Council. Where a variance or waiver has been granted for a development standard that does not otherwise conform to the
requirements of this Ordinance, that development standard shall be deemed conforming.
Section 703. Termination of Nonconforming Status.
703.01. In the event that any structure containing a nonconforming use, nonconforming structure, nonconforming
development site, or nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of
its fair market value at the time of loss, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such
structure shall not be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any purpose unless the structure and its development site shall
thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. When such a nonconforming structure or development site is
damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or less of its fair market value at the time of loss, no repairs or
rebuilding shall be permitted except in conformity with this Article and other applicable regulations of this Ordinance.
Such restoration shall be undertaken only under a valid building permit for which a complete application is submitted
within 18 months following said damage, which permit must be actively pursued to completion.
703.02. In the event that any nonconforming use, structure containing a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure,
is proposed to be physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale to the extent of
more than 50 percent of its fair market value, as determined by the Lee County Tax Assessor or licensed appraiser, such
structure shall not be physically expanded or modified through a change in character, operation, or scale for any purpose
unless the structure and its development site shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance.
703.03. Any other provision of this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, no use or structure which is accessory to a
principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or
terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance. For purposes of this paragraph,
ceased or terminated shall mean that regular use or occupation of a structure has not occurred for more than twelve
(12) consecutive months.
Section 704. Review Process.
704.01 Continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming
use are permitted as defined in Section 705.
704.02. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or nonconforming site that houses a conforming use,
and that meets the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03, shall use the permitted use in nonconforming structures
process in Section 706.
704.03. Enlargement, expansion, alteration or major repair of a nonconforming structure or a conforming structure on a
nonconforming site when such structure houses a nonconforming use, or when such structure houses a conforming use
shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in
Section 707 and Section 714 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of this section. Enlargements, expansions,
alterations and major repairs are all of those actions that do not meet the provisions of Section 705 or Section 706.
VII-2
704.04. Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval
in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 708 of this Ordinance and also the requirements of
this section.
704.05. Site Plans
Site plans may be required for activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.2. Site plans shall be required for
activities falling under the provisions of Section 704.03 and Section 704.04
Section 705. Continuation, Maintenance, and Minor Repair.
705.01. The continuation of a nonconforming use and maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a
nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation, maintenance, or minor repair does not extend or expand
the nonconforming use or structure, except in accordance with Section 705. For the purposes of this section,
"maintenance or minor repair" shall mean:
A. Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural
soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building
or structure;
B. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land
uses; and
C. Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety as determined by
the Codes Enforcement division (does not apply to damage or destruction governed by Section 703.01).
C. Incidental alterations (see Section 203), including:
a. Internal reconfigurations of an existing building that do not meet the definition of an alteration
(alterations must be approved through Section 707);
b. Limited modifications to an existing building façade, such as recladding or repainting
c. Addition or substitution of an awning or awnings;
d. Modifications or additions to approved landscaping;
705.02. In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a
period of twelve (12) months or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure
or premises is located, the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such
structure or premise is located.
Section 706. Permitted Uses in Nonconforming Structures.
706.01. The reuse or redevelopment of a nonconforming structure or conforming structure on a nonconforming site shall
not be required to acquire conditional use approval or undergo the typical DRT review procedure if the eligibility
requirements of Section 706.03 below are met. Owners of such properties may be issued a zoning certificate after staff
review of the proposed reuse or redevelopment. Reuse and redevelopment that does not qualify for consideration under
this section may instead utilize the process in Section 707 for review and approval.
706.02. Intent.
The intent of this process is to encourage the utilization of existing nonconforming buildings and sites as opposed to their
remaining vacant while at the same time reducing such nonconformities to the extent practical. The process allows
owners to make improvements to an existing structure or site without having to go through a lengthy review process,
produce a detailed site plan, reach compliance with all provisions of this Ordinance, or make roadway improvements.
VII-3
706.03 Eligibility Requirements
To qualify for issuance of a zoning certificate under Section 706, the following conditions must exist:
1. The proposed use is permitted within the zoning district.
2. The redeveloped use will occupy an existing building(s) on the site, with no expansions or additions proposed.
3. The site will add no more than 1,000 square feet of additional impervious surface.
4. The proposed new use does not expand existing encroachments into required buffers.
5. The site will be in compliance with the provisions of Article VI, Signs.
706.04 Limitations
Proposals which do not meet the eligibility requirements of Section 706.03 are required to undergo the normal DRT
review process and/or the conditional use process in cases of expansion or major alteration.
Proposals for nonconforming sites or structures that have been vacant for less than twelve (12) months and do not
involve, either proposed or required, any changes to the site or exterior of the structure (changes listed under Section 705
are exempted) shall be reviewed during the zoning certificate issuance process for compliance with the approved site plan
or ordinance requirements in effect at the time it was established. If one (1) or more aspects of the site and/or structure
fail to comply with the applicable plan approval or ordinance requirements, the deficiencies shall be corrected and the
Planning Director must verify compliance prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
Proposals involving a change in use that, although may be permitted within the underlying zoning district, will increase
the intensity of the use(s) originally approved, will be required to demonstrate compliance with the current Ordinance
requirements applicable to the proposed change prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate and/or certificate of
occupancy. Demonstrating compliance can be accomplished either through the site plan review or Section 706 process,
whichever is applicable.
706.05. Plan Submittal Requirements
Issuance of a zoning certificate under this section may require submission of the following information, upon request of
staff:
1. Landscaping and/or fencing compliant with Section 714, Minimum Acceptable Bufferyards; and
2. Off-street parking/parking lot design (dimensional standards and standard specifications); and
3. Screening of dumpsters, storage, heating and air conditioning, and similar equipment; and
4. Building improvements (painting or other changes); and
5. Access roads and entrances or exit drives to ensure automotive and pedestrian safety and traffic flow; and
706.06. Conditions
The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time
limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the
nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and
the general public.
706.07. Exceptions for Required Improvements
The Director of Planning and/or the Public Works Director may waive, in part or in full, certain required improvements
if meeting them is deemed impractical or unreasonable given the constraints on the existing site. Consideration may also
be given to the extent of the required improvements in relation to the specific nature and scope of the
reuse/redevelopment proposal.
Section 707. Administrative Review and Approval.
Enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site shall require administrative
site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section.
VII-4
707.01. Site plans as required in Section 704.05 shall be submitted for review by the Planning Director or his designee.
Site plans must meet the requirements of Section 802.12 of this Ordinance. The Planning Director or his designee shall
determine whether to approve the proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair. The Planning Director or
his designee shall not approve the proposed activity unless and until it is found, based on the submitted site plan, that the
proposed enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair meets the standards of review set forth in Section 802.05,
Review Procedures, of this Ordinance, as well as the following:
1. The nonconforming use allowed to continue remains compatible with adjacent land uses and the Future Land
Use Plan;
2. That all access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control and access in the case of fire or
other emergency;
3. That all off-street parking, loading, refuse collection, and other service areas will be adequate with respect to
automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and economic, noise, glare, odor, and other
impacts on adjoining properties;
4. That all water, wastewater treatment, schools, fire and police protection, and other necessary public and private
utilities and services will be adequate with respect to their location, availability, and compatibility with
adjoining properties;
5. That all landscaping, screening, and fencing will be adequate, with respect to the effectiveness of their type,
dimensions, and character, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic, noise, glare, odor, and
other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood;
6. That the type, size, and intensity of the proposed use, including such considerations as storage of items and
arrangement, the size of the site and the location of the use upon it, and the hours of operation and numbers of
people who are likely to utilize or be attached to the use, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact
of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties, other properties in the neighborhood, and the purposes of the
zoning district in which the property is located; and
7. Surface drainage will be adequate with respect to on-site and off-site erosion, siltation, pollution, flooding, or
other detrimental effects of the nonconformity.
707.02. Other Considerations
In determining whether the proposed extension, alteration, or major repair will substantially injure the use and enjoyment
of other properties, the Planning Director or his designee shall also consider and balance:
1. The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity resulting from denying the approval, from
approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or
from approving the request;
2. The possible detriment or benefit to the owners of nearby properties resulting from denying the approval, from
approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or
from approving the request; and
3. The possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from denying the approval, from approving the
request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving
the request.
707.03. Conditions
The Planning Director or his designee may impose any conditions on approval of the request, including appropriate time
limits for meeting those conditions, as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the
nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and
the general public.
VII-5
707.04. Limits on Expansion
If the Planning Director or his designee permits a nonconforming structure or use to expand, then the following shall
apply:
1. The area of such expansion shall not exceed 25 percent of the area of the existing nonconforming use or
structure, unless otherwise allowable in this Section;
2. Telecommunications towers may be expanded by more than 25 percent to permit the co-location of a second or
subsequent user or communications sending or receiving device so that the need for an additional tower is
eliminated. Only the City Council may permit the expansion of a non-conforming telecommunications tower in
districts in which it is not a permitted use.
707.05 Limits on Requirements
In acting upon applications submitted under Section 707, the Planning Director or his designee shall not order the
discontinuation or termination of nonconformity. If an application is denied, then the continuation, maintenance, and
minor repair of the nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this Article.
Section 708. Enlargement or Expansion of Conditional Uses.
Enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use that is a conditional use shall require conditional use approval in
accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section.
708.01. Process for Approval
The process for conditional use approval shall be in two parts:
1. Approval of the conditional use shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section 803 of this Ordinance,
requiring Planning Commission review and City Council approval.
2. Approval of the enlargement, expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconforming structure, use or site
shall require administrative site plan review and approval in accordance with the procedures and standards set
forth Section 707
Section 709. Exceptions for Residential Setbacks
Certain additions to existing, nonconforming single-, two-, three-, or multi-family or townhouse dwellings may extend
into a required front, side, or rear yard setback when the existing dwelling is already legally nonconforming with respect
to that setback. The nonconforming portion shall be at least 60 percent of the total width of the respective wall of the
structure prior to the addition. Additions may extend up to the height limit of the zoning district and extend into the
required front, side and/or rear yard setback as follows:
1. Front and rear yard setbacks: The addition may extend five feet into the required front or rear yard setback or to
the extent of the setback line formed by the nonconforming portion, whichever is less.
2. Side yard setbacks: The addition may extend into the required side yard setback up to the setback line formed
by the nonconforming wall, except in no case shall the addition be closer than 5 feet from the side property line.
Furthermore, the size of the addition shall be limited to an additional wall surface area within the required side
setback area of no more than 200 square feet.
Section 710. Exceptions for Historic Resources
In an effort to promote and encourage the preservation and adaptive reuse of locally designated resources, the Planning
Director or his designee may grant certain waivers to the zoning code provided that it will result in the preservation of a
locally designated property, after review and approval by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Planning Director,
or his designee, may authorize certain waivers to the requirements of the underlying zoning district, to the extent
indicated herein.
VII-6
1. Any building that is individually locally designated or is classified as a contributing building within a local
historic district, as identified in the contributing resources report, shall be permitted to be repaired, restored,
structurally altered, or reconstructed, notwithstanding any conflicts with provisions of the underlying zoning
district requirements pertaining to minimum lot size, setbacks, minimum lot width, FAR, open space, off-street
parking or loading requirements. In cases where the configuration of a locally designated property, or a
contributing property within a locally designated historic district precludes reasonable and appropriate use of
the property within the underlying zoning district a waiver of up to twenty percent (20%) from the underlying
requirements for setbacks, FAR, and open space may be authorized by the Planning Director or his designee.
2. Any contributing historic resource or building will not be limited to the valuation clause for nonconformities.
3. In cases where the size or configuration of a locally designated property, or a contributing property within a
locally designated historic district is such that compliance with off-street parking requirements would destroy
the historic character of the property, the Planning Director or his designee may authorize a reduction of up to
one hundred percent (100%) of the number of parking spaces that would ordinarily be required for a new
structure of equivalent use and floor area. Such a reduction will be granted only when it can be demonstrated
that:
a. Granting the modification will further the preservation of the historic and architectural character of the
historic resource, or of the historic district in which the proposal is located.
b. Granting the modification would promote the preservation of the historic resource or historic district
while reducing nonconformities.
c. Granting the modification would help minimize or mitigate any potential adverse effect of a specific
proposal whose implementation promotes the preservation of the historic resource or historic district.
d. Special circumstances exist such as adjacencies or shared parking that will practically alleviate
concerns for off-street parking.
The Planning Director, or his designee, shall make specific findings that establish how the criteria have been met.
Additionally, staff may impose any conditions, restrictions, or limitations deemed appropriate in order to ensure
compliance with the criteria set forth above.
Section 711. Nonconforming Lots of Record.
711.01. Subject to the provisions of this Section, a nonconforming lot of record may be used for any principal use
permitted or conditional, provided approval from City Council, in the zone in which the lot is located, provided that for
any use which is to be served by an individual well and/or septic system, the nonconforming lot shall be of a size and
design to meet the minimum requirements of the Lee County Health Department regulations for such wells and septic
systems.
711.02. Performance residential developments shall be prohibited on development sites smaller than the minimum sizes
established in Section 502.02. If permitted in the applicable zoning district, single family dwelling units may be
constructed on nonconforming lots of record at least 4,000 square feet in size and 50 feet in width. Adjoining lots, which
are combined to form one (1) parcel shall be considered to meet this standard.
711.03. Minimum lot sizes for nonresidential uses are established in Table 4-3. To qualify as a nonconforming lot of
record under this section, lots must have been platted prior to or in the year 1984 or be smaller than the following sizes:
Rural District (R) 40,000 s.f.
Industrial District (I) 10,000 s.f.
Other Districts1 7,500 s.f.
In addition to the requirements of the previous sentence, a nonconforming lot must be have fully complied with all
applicable laws and ordinances at the time it was recorded, but currently does not fully comply with the lot requirements
of this Ordinance concerning minimum area, minimum lot width, or minimum street frontage. Where a lot meets the
required minimum size for the district but not for a particular use category as specified in Table 4-3 (i.e., road service use
1However, no minimum lot size is required in the Urban Core (UC) District.
VII-7
requires 30,000 s.f.) it shall not be considered a nonconforming lot of record. The lot shall instead be used for another
development type for which it is eligible, based on its size.
Property which qualifies as a nonconforming lot of record under this Section shall be eligible for any land use category
having a minimum size requirement of 40,000 s.f. in the Rural (R) district, 10,000 square feet in the Industrial (I) district,
and 7,500 s.f. in all others, as established in Table 4-3.
711.04. No nonresidential use(s) shall be permitted on nonconforming lots of record less than 6,000 square feet in size
and 60 feet in width unless the Board of Zoning Adjustment grants a variance. Variances granted under this section shall
not be use specific but rather granted for the required lot size and width for a particular use.
Section 712. Nonconforming Uses
In the event that a structure or premise occupied by a nonconforming use becomes and remains vacant for a one (1) year
period or more, or is used for a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure or premises is located,
the use of same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which such structure or premise is
located.
712.01. Change of Use
Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and permits that this Ordinance
requires for the intended or resulting use. No nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use.
Section 713. Manufactured Home Parks
713.01. Existing manufactured home parks, which are nonconforming by use, shall not be redesigned, expanded in area,
or modified to accommodate additional manufactured homes.
713.02. Manufactured home parks which are properly zoned and which are nonconforming by design only may be
expanded in area and/or modified so as to reduce or eliminate those aspects of design, which render it nonconforming.
The Planning Commission may authorize additional manufactured home sites in such parks upon submission of a site
plan, consistent with the standards of Section 802, showing a redesign of the park, which substantiates the following:
A. The overall density of the park will not exceed seven (7) units per acre.
B. A 20-foot wide residential buffer shall be provided along all development site boundaries (See Section
426.03, Residential Buffer Landscaping Requirements).
C. No new manufactured home will be placed within 20 feet of any property line.
D. Where possible, all development standards of Section 502.02(G) have been met, or the degree of
nonconformity reduced. In no case shall the degree of nonconformity of any design aspect be
increased.
A redesign proposal that does not include the addition of new manufactured home spaces shall not be subject to
conditions A and B above. Any redesign proposal shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer.
713.03. The replacement of an existing manufactured home shall be allowed, provided that such replacement does not
increase any degree of existing nonconformity (e.g. setbacks).
VII-8
Section 714. Minimum Acceptable Bufferyard.
Subsequent to the discontinuance of a nonconforming use, a development site, which is nonconforming by physical
design, may be utilized for any activity or use which is otherwise permitted by this Ordinance. However, as a condition
of approval of any enlargement, reconfiguration or any type of new development on the site, certain improvements must
be made pursuant to this Section. When nonconformity is a result of noncompliance with the bufferyard required by
Article IV of this Ordinance and the subject property is physically unable, because of its limited land area, to meet
normal bufferyard requirements, the following requirements shall be met:
A. In no case shall bufferyard requirements less than those provided in Figure 7-1 be applied to the site.
B. Where an anchor tenant (40,000 square feet of gross floor area or larger) of a shopping center has been
replaced, full compliance with the bufferyard requirements of Article IV shall result. When such
alterations shall result in a nonconformity with the provisions of this Ordinance (i.e., required
parking), or an increase in an already nonconforming aspect of the Ordinance, the site shall conform to
subsection A, above.
C. If in the judgment of the Planning Director and City Engineer, subsection B cannot be met, then upon
evaluation of the size and other relevant characteristics of a site, bufferyard width and planting
requirements may be prorated as appropriate, in consultation with the Planning Commission.
Section 715. Nonconforming Signs.
A nonconforming sign is any sign within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Auburn on the effective
date of this Article or any sign existing within any area annexed into such jurisdiction after the effective date of this
Article which is prohibited by, or does not conform to the requirements of Article VI of this Ordinance.
Nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition. However, such signs shall:
A. not be structurally altered to accommodate another nonconforming sign or sign face;
B. not be structurally altered in order to prolong the life of the sign, except to meet safety requirements as
specified by the Chief Building Official or City Engineer;
C. not be altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign (including additional or
replacement sign faces);
D. not be enlarged in any manner;
E. not be allowed to remain if a change of use occurs as defined by this ordinance, or if the premises
promoted by the sign comes under new ownership or tenancy and such sign is proposed to be
remodeled, repainted, have the face replaced or otherwise changed for the purpose of displaying the
new name or other new identification of the premises; or
F. not be re-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction or repair
exceeds 50 percent of the appraised replacement cost. This cost shall be exclusive of any expected or
estimated revenue generated by the sign.
G. be removed if the sign or sign structure identifying a previous use or activity that has not occupied the
site for a period greater than sixty (60) days, does not maintain a current business license or pertains
to a time, event or purpose which no longer applies. The owner of the sign or owner of the property
shall have 60 days to remove the sign.
VII-9
Section 716. Appeal Process.
Any person aggrieved or affected by the provisions of Article VII of this Ordinance may appeal to the Board of Zoning
Adjustment for relief in accordance with the provisions of Section 908 of this Ordinance.

ARTICLE VIII. DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS
Section 800. Purpose.
This Article sets forth the procedures required for obtaining development approval within the City of
Auburn. Site plans, subdivisions, conditional uses, zoning certificates, and certificates of occupancy are
addressed herein. However, the approval of a development under the provisions of this Article does not
imply any variation or waiver of any provisions of the building code, housing code, fire code, or any other
applicable code, standard, or regulation adopted by the City of Auburn, the State of Alabama, or the United
States Government.
Section 801. Subdivisions.
Any subdivision or resubdivision of land, or combining of lots within the City of Auburn, and within
unincorporated areas lying within five (5) miles of the Auburn city limits, shall be carried out in accordance
with the Auburn Subdivision Regulations, the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction Manual, and
the Water Resource Management Department Design and Construction Manual, which are hereby
incorporated by reference into this Ordinance. All development within subdivisions shall be consistent
with applicable sections of this Ordinance.
Section 802. Site Plans.
802.01. Intent and Purpose. This Section shall apply to all site plans as defined in Article II. The site
plan procedures shall be required in order to ensure that site-specific development projects meet the
requirements of this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate authorizing a building permit. It
is the intent of this Section that the site plan review process be a part of the building permit application
process, and that the site plan shall be the instrument by which improvements to the site will be constructed
and inspected prior to occupancy of the development.
802.02. Development Requiring Site Plan Approval. Prior to issuance of a zoning certificate, site plan
approval shall be required for all proposed non-residential construction, as well as residential development
types described in Sections 502.02 (F), (G), and (H). This shall include clubhouses or other ancillary
facilities within a residential subdivision. Site plan approval shall also be required for the subdivision of an
existing development site of a type subject to site plan requirements, and/or an expansion, reduction or
reconfiguration of any such development type. For any proposal in which these requirements are unclear,
the Planning Director shall determine whether site plan approval is necessary.
802.03. Review of Site Plans. Site plans submitted for review shall be approved, disapproved, or referred
to the Planning Commission. Site plan review shall be in accordance with Section 1.0  General
Information of the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction Manual. In approving a site plan, any
request for waivers from the requirements of this Ordinance shall be taken to the Planning Commission for
consideration as provided in Section 802.04.
The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to approve a site plan:
A. Completeness of application information as required under Section 802.12;
B. Consistency with adopted policies and standards of the Major Streets and Utilities Master
Plans;
C. Uses permitted on the development site under the provisions of this Ordinance;
D. Whether the site plan meets applicable design standards established by this Ordinance;
VIII-1
E. Availability and adequate capacity of public facilities to serve the development, such as
roads, sewer, water, schools, solid waste disposal, and fire protection (including access to
the site for emergency vehicles); and
F. Compatibility with surrounding land uses (this criterion shall apply only where a site plan
proposes a conditional use pursuant to Section 803).
The Planning Director and/or City Engineer may refer any site plan proposal to the Planning Commission.
802.04. Waiver of Selected Development Standards  Approval by Planning Commission. Specific
development standards that may be modified with Planning Commission Approval are limited to the
following: bufferyards, including width, planting and required structures; and general and off-street
parking landscaping requirements. This may be done only upon a specific finding by the Planning
Commission that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to a particular development site due to its
size, proposed use, and/or location, and that a waiver would not conflict with the intent of this Ordinance or
confer upon any property owner a right or privilege denied to neighboring property owners within the same
district.
802.05. Review Procedures. Site plan applicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Planning
Director and staff prior to formal submission of a site plan for review. At the applicants request, a preapplication
conference shall be held, at which time planning staff members will provide the applicant with
advice and guidance regarding the requirements of this Ordinance, and any other regulations which apply.
Preliminary sketches shall be reviewed and overall development concepts finalized at this time. It shall be
the applicants responsibility to request the pre-application conference and any other available guidance in
sufficient time to prepare a complete application package. Site plan submittals shall be in accordance with
Section 1.0  General Information of the Auburn Public Works Design and Construction Manual.
A. Site Plan Preparation Requirements. Where the proposed development site is three (3)
acres in size or larger, the site plan shall be prepared and sealed by an architect,
professional engineer or surveyor. At the Planning Directors discretion, the same
requirement may be applied to sites of less than three (3) acres where the plan proposes
high-intensity uses or activities that may have a substantial impact on surrounding
properties.
Sketch plans and drawings submitted with variance or other zoning-related applications
shall not be accepted for review as a site plan unless they are prepared in accordance with
the guidelines of this Section and contain all required information. In all cases,
engineering plans addressing drainage, road construction and other technical aspects of
development design shall be sealed by a civil engineer registered in the State of Alabama.
B. Development Site Requirements. For development sites of one (1) acre or more, full
engineering drawings or a Project Engineers Statement must be submitted by an
engineer registered in the State of Alabama. The City Engineer may choose to require
additional information as necessary.
C. Completeness of Plans. Site plans submitted without complete information in
accordance with Section 802.12 shall not be reviewed by the Planning Staff or placed on
the Planning Commission Agenda.
D. Staff Review. The Planning Director and other appropriate city staff members shall
review the site plan with specific regard to this Ordinance and other regulations of the
City of Auburn. The staff review shall identify matters of development policy concern to
which the applicant shall address particular attention.
VIII-2
E. Revised Plans. Following submission of a complete application package for site plan
review the Planning staff shall have 15 working days in which to complete the review
and approve the site plan.
For site plans that must go before the Planning Commission, at such time as the Planning
Commission determines that all staff comments have been adequately addressed, and that
the requirements of all applicable City, State and Federal regulations have been met, it
shall approve the site plan.
802.06. Approval of Site Plans. Except as stipulated in Section 802.04, no site plan shall be approved
which is inconsistent with any term contained in this Ordinance unless a variance has been authorized in
accordance with Section 907 of this Ordinance.
802.07. Effect of Site Plan Approval. Approved site plans shall remain valid for 18 months after final
approval, and a zoning certificate and building permit for the development may be obtained during that
time period. The Planning Director may make an extension of site plan approval for a single period up to
six (6) months from the date when a site plan would otherwise expire. An extension may be granted only if
the Planning Director concludes that the applicant or developer has proceeded with due diligence and in
good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to warrant a new application. All such
requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30 days before the expiration of the
approved site plan stating the reason for the time extension request.
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit
a new application for review according to the requirements of this Section.
Upon approval of the site plan, the applicant may proceed to submit detailed construction drawings to the
Engineering and Codes Enforcement Divisions for permitting. These shall include, but are not limited to,
detailed building plans, grading plans, drainage and stormwater management facilities, erosion control
plans, road and driveway construction specifications, and tree removal plans.
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Codes Enforcement Division from accepting for review and
processing building construction plans related to the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
systems prior to final approval of a site plan, subject to such conditions as may be established by that
department relative to processing of site plans prior to final approval.
In such instances, no building permit will be issued until the Planning Department has issued a zoning
certificate and the site plan has been stamped approved and is on file in the office of the Codes
Enforcement Division. All building and construction permits issued for any project requiring site plan
review shall be consistent with the stamped approved site plan. The approval of a site plan shall not under
any circumstances be construed to waive or otherwise diminish the applicable City requirements for
construction or installation of structures or materials. Whenever a conflict between the site plan and such
construction details occurs, the more restrictive or that requiring the higher standard shall prevail.
802.08. Modification or Termination of Site Plans.
A. Site Plan Amendments. After final approval, any modification, variation or adjustment
of a stamped approved site plan shall require approval of a site plan amendment.
Upon approval of any amendment, the Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall stamp
and date the most recent version of the site plan, showing the approved amendment, and
mark all previous copies as void. If appropriate, the Engineering and Codes
Enforcement Divisions shall be notified of the amendment.
B. Site Plan Expiration and Cancellation. In the event of a change to these regulations the
site plan shall be valid under the regulations for which it was approved for 18 months
from the date of such approval. Upon expiration of the site plan and any extension that
VIII-3
may have been granted, the Planning Director shall make appropriate records in the
Planning Department files stamp all available copies of the site plan as void, and notify
the Engineering and Codes Enforcement Divisions of the expiration.
The applicant may cancel the site plan at any time between the date of final approval and
the date of expiration by submitting a written request to the Planning Director. Upon
receipt of this request by the Planning Director, the site plan shall be treated as expired.
802.09. Integration of Other Review Procedures. Any site plan to be built in stages or requiring
variance or conditional use approval shall be coordinated as set forth below:
A. Development Built in Stages. As part of the application for site plan approval, the
developer shall submit a proposed staging of development plan, including a schedule for
completion of all improvements pursuant to Section 504.02. If the site plan proposes any
of the performance residential housing types described in Section 502.02 (A) through
(G), a Master Development Plan pursuant to Section 504 shall also be required. Once a
site plan for a stage has been approved, no land may be used and no building may be
occupied except in accordance with such plan. A new site plan is required for each
successive stage of the development.
Stage configurations shall be logical and consistent with the purposes of this Ordinance.
If appropriate, the Planning Director may stipulate that any or all portions of the required
landscaping and/or bufferyards be provided during the first stage of development, even
though some bufferyards or portions thereof lie outside the stage. Each stage, at a
minimum, must include adequate parking, drainage facilities, landscaping, and all other
features needed to serve that portion of the total development (See Sections 504.02 and
504.06).
Prior to approval for construction of any one stage, an engineering stage plan shall be
submitted to and approved by the City Engineer. This plan shall address site grading,
erosion control, stormwater management, internal traffic circulation, and any other design
elements required by the City Engineer.
In approving a stage plan, the Planning Commission or Planning staff may specify certain
site improvements to be provided at a percentage rate exceeding that of construction of
the overall development. These items may be elements of engineering design, or
requirements of this Ordinance. Such improvements include, but are not limited to
parking, drainage facilities, erosion control measures, landscaping and bufferyards.
Where the applicant has agreed to provide off-site improvements, such as traffic signals,
turn lanes, and sewer lines, the City Engineer may require such improvements to be in
place upon completion of any stage of the development.
B. Variance. Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this
Ordinance in conjunction with site plan review shall have the appropriate request acted
upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. This shall include existing development sites,
proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to any requirement
of this Ordinance. The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on
the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been
approved.
C. Conditional Uses. For developments requiring approval of a conditional use, a request
for such approval shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and City Council, and
the conditional use shall be approved prior to final approval of the site plan. A site plan
and a conditional use request may be processed concurrently.
VIII-4
802.10. Non-Compliance. Failure to comply with a stamped approved site plan or any of the conditions
upon which such approval was contingent, including time limits for performance, shall be cause to deny
issuance of a zoning certificate or, where a zoning certificate has been issued pursuant to a stamped
approved site plan, to render such zoning certificate invalid. Any action, construction, development or use
of property undertaken in violation of the provisions of this Section for a site plan shall constitute a
violation of this Ordinance and may be subject to a stop-work order.
802.11. Development Site to Be Unified.
A. Internal Division of Ownership. Except as provided in this section, the development
site shall remain unified by title under one (1) owner, or by multiple owners holding a
percentage interest in the site as a whole. Where a development site consists of two (2)
or more existing lots under the same ownership, all such lots shall be combined in
accordance with the Subdivision Regulations prior to final approval of the site plan.
Where spatial division of ownership within a development site is proposed, the owners of
all component properties shall accept the following conditions in receiving site plan
approval:
1. No individual property will be used or developed in any way that is not
consistent with the approved site plan.
2. Development rights on each parcel are combined with those of the balance of
the development site, and the City will consider no separate development
proposals unless the development site can be divided in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
3. No parcel of land within a development site shall be subdivided, sold or
otherwise conveyed for the purpose of new development that is not authorized
under the approved site plan.
All owners of property within the development site shall authorize one (1) person,
designated as the applicant, to represent them collectively before the Planning
Commission and other City officials in all maters related to the site plan and development
site.
B. External Ownership. When the development site is part of a larger parcel of property,
of which a portion is not intended to be included within the site plan, this unused area
shall become a separate lot, meeting any relevant size and dimensional requirements of
this Ordinance, to be approved in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations. This
subdivision process shall be completed prior to final approval of the site plan.
C. Development Site to Be Complete. The development site shall be designed to provide
all required amenities and facilities, including bufferyards, open space, landscaping; no
such required features shall be located off-site or on adjacent properties which are leased,
rented, or otherwise proposed for use on an informal basis, except as provided for in
Section 509.02. The entire site shall have the zoning designation required to
accommodate the principal use.
D. Division After Approval. No development site, once granted site plan approval, shall be
divided except through the site plan amendment process established in Section 802.08.
802.12. Site Plan Preparation Requirements. A site plan must accurately show all relevant information
about a proposed development to permit it to be reviewed against the requirements of this Ordinance, and
to provide a permanent record as to the type and characteristics of development approved on the site. Site
plans shall be drawn, on an overall sheet size not to exceed 24 by 36 inches, to one of the following scales:
VIII-5
1:10
1:20
1:30
1:40
1:50
1:60
1:100
When more than one (1) sheet is needed, a series of drawings showing different elements of the site design,
such as landscaping, utilities, or topography may be submitted. Where such a series is submitted, the top
sheet shall include an index of all other sheets in the series. These shall be bound in a single package, with
each sheet labeled as to what it shows and its number in the series (e.g., Landscaping Plan, Sheet 2 of 3)
Unless specifically waived by the Planning Director, the following information shall be shown on all site
plans:
A. Written Information:

Section 803. Conditional Uses.
Conditional uses are those uses that have some special impact which differs from the potential impacts of
permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have a uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding
environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed in a particular location.
Upon submission of a request for conditional use approval, a review of the location, design, configuration,
and impact shall be conducted to determine whether the proposed use would have a detrimental impact on
neighboring properties.
The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use;
planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by the proposed use;
whether and to what extent the use at the particular location for which it is proposed is consistent with the
intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and any other development policies and/or regulations of the City of
Auburn; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize
any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and
welfare in general.
803.01. Applicability. Any use designated as a conditional use by Table 4-1 of this Ordinance shall
comply with this Section.
In addition, the following shall be approved only as conditional uses:
A. Any performance residential use (except Manufactured home parks, which are not
allowed) in the Corridor Redevelopment District, Urban (CRD-U), Suburban (CRD-S),
and West (CRD-W) and Planned Development District (PDD).
803.02. Procedures. Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted and approved prior to
application for a zoning certificate. A subdivision plat or a site plan meeting the requirements of Section
802 shall support applications for conditional uses in all districts. Site plan or subdivision approval shall
not be granted prior to or contingent upon conditional use approval.
The Planning Director shall process applications for a conditional use permit as follows:
A. Applications for a conditional use permit must be submitted to the Planning Director 23
days prior to the public hearing, as required in Section 803.02 (B). Copies of the
application shall be distributed to the appropriate department heads.
VIII-8
B. A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission after adjoining property
owners have been notified of the public hearing by certified mail and signs announcing
the public hearing have been erected on the property in question. Not later than five (5)
days prior to the date set for the hearing on the application, the Planning Director shall
file a written report thereon with the Planning Commission.
C. The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds that the application and
record fail to establish compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. Further, the
application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, despite any
mitigating conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission, outweigh any
public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial in the interest of the overall
public health, safety, and welfare.
D. In order to prevent or minimize adverse effects on other properties in the neighborhood
and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Auburn, the Planning
Commission may impose such restrictions and conditions on approval of the proposed
use as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this
Ordinance. All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval, except
those which are otherwise stated in this Ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the
resolution granting such conditional use permits.
E. Within 35 days of the public hearing on the application, unless an extension of this time
is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall render to the City Council
its recommendation either to grant the application for a conditional use permit, grant it
subject to conditions, or deny it. The failure of the Planning Commission to act within
this time period shall constitute a recommendation by it that the application be approved.
Within 60 days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City
Council, the City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application
shall fail. The City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause. Following a
public hearing, the City Council shall either approve, or disapprove, the application and
shall establish the specific conditions under which the application is approved.
F. In the event a permit for a conditional use is approved or approved subject to conditions,
the applicant shall submit a site plan meeting all conditions of approval. The Planning
Director shall then take action to process the application on the zoning certificate for the
development to which the conditional use permit applies. In the event such permit is not
approved or is approved subject to conditions that are not acceptable to the applicant, the
applicant may, within the aforesaid time period, either appeal such decision or abandon
the application.
803.03. Conditions on Conditional Use Approvals. Every conditional use permit shall be contingent
upon the proposed development fully complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and, where
applicable, with the Subdivision Regulations. The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use
permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
803.04. General Use Standards. No application for a conditional use permit shall be approved unless
the City Council shall specifically find the proposed conditional use appropriate in the location for which it
is proposed. This finding shall be based on the following criteria:
A. The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose, goals, objectives, and
standards of this Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or
under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City.
B. The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a substantial or undue
adverse effect on adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions,
VIII-9
parking, public improvements, public sites or rights-of-way, or other matters affecting the
public health, safety, and general welfare; either as they now exist or as they may in the
future be developed as a result of the implementation of provisions and policies of this
Ordinance, or any other plan, program, map, or ordinance adopted, or under
consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City or other governmental agency
having jurisdiction to guide growth and development.
C. The proposed use will be adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden on
any of the improvements, facilities, utilities, and services specified in this subsection.
Where any such improvements, facilities, utilities, or services are not available or
adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the applicant shall, as part
of the application and as a condition to approval of the proposed conditional use permit,
be responsible for establishing ability, willingness, and bind commitment to provide such
improvements, facilities, utilities, and services in sufficient time and in a manner
consistent with this Ordinance, and other plans, programs, maps, and ordinances adopted
by the City to guide its growth and development. The approval of the conditional use
permit shall be conditioned upon such improvements, facilities, utilities, and services
being provided and guaranteed by the applicant.
D. The Planning Commission may attach recommendations for conditional use approval,
additional criteria dealing with bufferyards, parking, lighting, building materials, or any
other aspect of site plan approval necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed
conditional use on the surrounding property.
803.05. Effect of Conditional Use Approval. Upon final approval of a conditional use permit, no
structures, uses or development of any kind shall be permitted on a development site except in accordance
with the site plan approval process as set forth in Section 802.
Conditional use permits shall remain valid for 18 months after final approval. The City Council, upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission, may make an extension of conditional use permit approval
for a single period of up to six (6) months from the date when a conditional use permit would otherwise
expire. An extension may be granted only if the City Council concludes that the applicant or developer has
proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that conditions have not changed substantially so as to
warrant a new application. All such requests for extensions must be submitted in writing not less than 30
days before the expiration of the conditional use permit stating the reason for the time extension request.
Requests for extensions in excess of six (6) months shall not be granted. Instead, the applicant shall submit
a new application for review according to the requirements of this section.
Section 804. Zoning Certificates.
No development permitted by this Ordinance, including accessory and temporary uses, may be established
and no existing building may be altered with respect to its use after the effective date of this Ordinance
until a zoning certificate has been secured from the Planning Director.
Nothing herein shall relieve any applicant of the additional responsibility of seeking any permit required by
any applicable statute, ordinance, or regulations in compliance with all of the terms of this Ordinance.
Conditions for permits to raze or remove buildings are set by other ordinances.
The violation of any condition contained in a conditional use permit shall be a violation of this Ordinance.
804.01. Application Requirements for Zoning Certificates. All applications for zoning certificates shall
be made in writing by the owner or developer of the property for which it is sought. The application shall
be filed with the Planning Director and include two (2) copies of the following:
A. Legal description of the parcel(s) for which the certificate is sought.
VIII-10
B. Conditional Use Permit, if required (Section 803).
C. Request for site plan review if required (Section 802).
When a zoning certificate is sought for a development that is a part of a plat or subdivision, which has
received final plat approval or which has been issued a conditional use permit, the plat or conditional use
permit, together with any covenants, conditions, or other restrictions related thereto, shall be submitted as a
part of the application for the zoning certificate.
Application for a conditional use permit, where required, shall be made and approval granted by the City
Council prior to application for a zoning certificate.
In the case of any development located within a subdivision, the subdivision shall have final plat approval
and have been recorded before the Planning Director will accept an application for a zoning certificate. If
the development for which a zoning certificate is sought is required by this Ordinance to undergo site plan
review, the approved site plan shall be made a part of the application for a zoning certificate and shall
suffice as the statement of proposed use required by this Section.
A temporary use and an accessory use shall require a zoning certificate as a precondition to their lawful
establishment. The Planning Director may establish regulations governing the application requirements for
a zoning certificate in the case of either a temporary or accessory use that is established at any time other
than simultaneously with a principal use, in which case all information specified in this Section shall be
submitted. The purpose of the required information is to provide the Planning Director with a sufficient
factual basis to determine whether all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to temporary and
accessory uses have been met.
804.02. Procedures. All developments for which a zoning certificate is required shall be reviewed for
compliance with this Ordinance; within 30 calendar days after the application for a zoning certificate has
been accepted, the Planning Director shall inform the applicant whether the application has been granted.
A. In any case where the application is granted, the Planning Director shall issue a zoning
certificate which shall state: This certificate does not signify building codes review or
approval nor subdivision review or approval and is not authorization to undertake any
work without such review and approval where either is required. Before any structure to
which this certificate is applicable may be occupied or used for any purpose, a certificate
of occupancy must be obtained.
B. In any case where an application is denied, the Planning Director shall state the specific
reasons and shall cite the specific chapters, articles, and sections of this Ordinance upon
which denial is based. If relief of such denial would be available by special permit or
variance, the Planning Director shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the
appropriate sections of this Ordinance.
Following site plan and/or conditional use approval, an applicant shall have 18 months from the date of
approval to begin construction. In addition, an applicant shall have 90 days from the date of issuance of a
zoning certificate to begin construction. For the purposes of this Section, beginning of construction is
defined as the date on which a building permit is issued by the City of Auburn for the construction,
renovation, modification, or other work required.
Section 805. Certificate of Occupancy.
No land or building for which a zoning certificate has been issued shall be occupied or used in whole or in
part for any use whatsoever after the effective date of this Ordinance until the owner, tenants, contract
purchaser, or authorized agent thereof has been issued a certificate of occupancy by the Senior Building
VIII-11
Inspector, indicating that the building or use complies with all zoning requirements of this Ordinance, the
building code, and other applicable codes and regulations.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the premises in question have been inspected and found by
the Senior Building Inspector to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.
No permit for any new use or construction that will involve the on-site disposal of sewage or waste, and no
permit for a change in use or an alteration that will result in an increased volume of sewage or waste to be
disposed of on the site, or which requires the County Health Departments approval shall be issued until
said approval has been issued by said Health Department.
The issuance of a certificate of occupancy in no way relieves any recipient thereof from compliance with
all of the terms of this Ordinance and all other applicable regulations.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless required bufferyards have been installed or appropriately
bonded.
Section 806. Access.
As a precondition to approval of any site plan, subdivision plat, zoning certificate, building permit, or any
other type of development permit, any development site shall have legal access to a publicly owned and
maintained road. Physical access alone shall not qualify any development site for such permits. Legal
access shall consist of the required length of road frontage, a flag lot approval pursuant to Section 512, or
access easements under this Section.
806.01. Access Easements. Access by easement shall be approved only by specific action of the Planning
Commission, and where normal requirements cannot be met. In all such cases, the following conditions
shall apply:
A. The property owner seeking a permit shall possess a valid legal instrument, recorded in
the Office of the Judge of Probate, indicating ownership of an access strip or easement at
least 15 feet in width connecting the subject property with a public road;
B. No access shall serve more than one (1) building site;
C. No development shall be authorized on any such building site other than one (1) single
family dwelling and permitted accessory structures;
D. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the access shall be graded and/or covered
with a suitable surface so as to be passable to emergency vehicles; and
E. The permit applicant shall sign a statement indicating that the City of Auburn has no
obligation to repair and/or maintain the access in a usable condition, and that the City
shall not be liable for injuries to persons or damage to property resulting from the sites
lack of direct access to a public road.
Section 807. Fees.
A schedule of application fees for site plan and subdivision approval, zoning certificates, and other permits
and public hearings required under this Ordinance shall be established by separate resolution or ordinance.
This fee schedule shall be computed so as to recover all costs incurred by the City in reviewing and
processing zoning-related requests, and shall be revised as necessary by the City Council.

IX-3
Section 905. Interpretations.
905.01. Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended to provide a simple and expeditious method
for clarifying ambiguities in the text of this Ordinance, the zoning map which it incorporates, and the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to it. It is also intended to provide a simple procedure for overcoming
rigidities and limitations of finite use lists.
905.02. Authority. The Planning Director may, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations set
forth in this Section, render interpretations of any provision of this Ordinance or any rule or regulation
issued pursuant to it, including interpretations of the various uses in any district not expressly mentioned in
this Ordinance.
905.03. Procedure.
A. Written Request for Non-Use Interpretation. Except as provided below, a request for
interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance, the zoning map, or any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant to this Ordinance shall be submitted in writing to the
Planning Director. No fee shall be required in connection with any such request. Each
such request shall set forth the specific provision or provisions to be interpreted, the facts
of the specific situation giving rise to the request for an interpretation, and the precise
interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct. Before rendering any interpretation,
the Planning Director shall receive such further facts and information as are in his
judgment necessary to a meaningful interpretation of the provision in question.
B. Application for Use Interpretation. Applications for a use interpretation shall be
submitted to the Planning Director and shall, in all instances, contain at least the
following information and documentation:
1. The applicants names, address, and interest in the subject property.
2. The owners name and address, if different from the applicants, and the owners
signed consent to the filing of the application.
3. The names and addresses of all professional consultants advising the applicant
with respect to the interpretation.
4. The street address and legal description of the subject property.
5. The zoning classification and present use of the subject property.
6. A complete description of the proposed use.
7. The uses permitted by the present zoning classification, which are most similar
to the proposed use.
8. Documents, statements, and other evidence demonstrating that the proposed use
will comply with all use limitations established for the district in which it is
proposed to be located.
9. Such other and further information or documentation as the Planning Director
may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and
disposition of the particular application.
C. Planning Director. Within 30 days following the receipt by the Planning Director of a
completed request or application for interpretation, the Planning Director shall mail a
written copy of the interpretation to the applicant. The Planning Director shall state the
IX-4
specific precedent, reasons, and analysis on which such interpretation is based. The
failure of the Planning Director to render an interpretation within such time, or such
longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed to be a
rejection of the applicants proposed interpretation. The Planning Director shall keep a
copy of each such interpretation on file and shall make a copy of each such file
interpretation available for public inspection during normal business hours.
D. Appeal. Appeals on interpretations rendered by the Planning Director pursuant to this
Section may be taken to the Board of Zoning Adjustment as provided in this Article.
905.04. Conditions on Use Interpretations. The following conditions shall govern the Planning
Director, and the Board of Zoning Adjustment on appeals from the Planning Director, in issuing use
interpretations:
A. No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use that was previously
considered and rejected by the Board of Zoning Adjustment on an application for
amendment.
B. No use interpretation shall permit a use in any district in which such use is not listed
either as permitted or conditional in Table 4-1.
C. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be
presented which demonstrates that it will comply with each use limitation established for
the particular district.
D. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such use is
substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district and is more similar to such
other uses than to uses permitted or conditionally permitted in a less restrictive district.
E. If the proposed use is more similar to a conditional use than a permitted use in the district
in which it is proposed to be located, then any use interpretation permitting such use shall
be conditioned on the issuance of a conditional use permit.
F. Any use permitted pursuant to this Section shall fully comply with all requirements and
standards imposed by this Ordinance.
905.05. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be
permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the establishment of such use or
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals
which may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City of Auburn, or other governmental agencies
having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, zoning certificates,
conditional use permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.
905.06. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. No use interpretation finding a particular use to
be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified district shall supersede subsequent amendment to this
Ordinance.
Section 906. Amendments.
This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as conditions warrant in the following manner. As used
herein, the term application includes City Council resolution.
A. Initiation Procedures. A proposed change to the zoning district boundaries or of the
regulations may be initiated by the City Council, the Auburn Planning Commission, or by
IX-5
petition of one or more owners or authorized agents of such owners of property within
the area proposed to be changed.
B. Text Amendments. The application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance shall
state in particular the article, section, subsection, and paragraph sought to be amended.
The application shall contain the language of the proposed amendment and shall recite
the reasons for such proposed change in the text.
C. Map Amendments.
1. Applications to rezone any property, or any application which seeks to change
or modify the standards and requirements imposed on a particular piece of
property by the text and maps of this Ordinance, including applications for
variances and conditional use permits, may be instituted by the City of Auburn
or all the owners of the property sought to be affected, or their assigns.
2. In the case where the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, said
applicant shall secure a notarized authorization to act as applicant from the
property owner, along with the regularly required copy of the deed for the
property.
3. When a development proposal involves approval of a site plan or subdivision
plat in addition to a zoning map amendment, no site plan or subdivision plat
approval shall be granted prior to approval of the map amendment. If a
development plan and the corresponding request for zoning change are to be
addressed at the same public hearing, the Planning Commission shall render a
decision on the zoning application before considering any related site plan or
subdivision plat. Such decision shall be based on the requirements of this
Ordinance and the full range of uses permitted in the requested district, and not
on the specific development concept proposed by the applicant.
4. All properties annexed into the City of Auburn shall receive the Rural (R)
District designation. If another zoning designation is desired, the owner or
authorized representative shall make application for rezoning in accordance with
these regulations.
D. Public Hearing. Upon application, the Planning Commission shall, after giving 15 days
notice, conduct a public hearing on the proposed amendment. The Planning Commission
shall consider and make recommendations on all proposed amendments, taking into
account: (1) the testimony at the hearing; (2) a site inspection of the property in question;
(3) the recommendations from interested official bodies; and (4) the standards provided
below.
906.01. Standards for Map Amendments.
A. No rezoning of land from the Rural (R) District to the Comprehensive Development
District (CDD) or Development District Housing (DDH), or from CDD or DDH to R
shall be permitted except upon a specific and documented finding that:
1. A change in demand which significantly (by a factor of at least 25 percent) alters
the development potential of the land has occurred such as: (a) a significant
change in migration patterns, family size, or birth rate since the last amendment
of the CDD or DDH or (b) a major change, such as the construction of a major
road, the installation of a sewer line, or the provision of a formerly unavailable
water supply, which significantly alters the suitability of an area for
development.
IX-6
2. An area designated as a CDD or DDH has been precluded from development by
unanticipated, long term events such as the non-provision of a sewer plant or
interceptor or a sewer ban, and that said area constitutes a significant part of the
total amount of the planned CDD or DDH.
B. No rezoning of land to the Urban Core (UC) District shall be permitted except upon a
specific and documented finding that:
1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities of an Urban Core
District that cannot be provided by the district planned and mapped as urban
core on the official zoning map and,
2. Impact studies of the existing Urban Core District and development in other
districts, within a one (1) mile radius of the site proposed for rezoning,
demonstrate that the proposed rezoning will not have adverse impacts on their
economic viability and,
3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed urban core development will not
have adverse impacts on the level of service of arterial roads, whether in
incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site
proposed for rezoning.
C. No rezoning of land to the Urban Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts
shall be permitted except on a specific and documented finding that:
1. Marketing studies demonstrate a demand for the facilities and uses of the Urban
Neighborhood (UN-E, UN-W, and UN-S) Districts that cannot be provided by
the districts planned and mapped as University Service on the official zoning
map, and;
2. Improvements to streets and pedestrian ways, either existing or planned, can be
undertaken in a manner that does not adversely impact the existing planned
system of access and separation of vehicular and foot traffic, and;
3. Traffic studies demonstrate that the proposed Urban Neighborhood development
will not adversely impact the level of service of arterial roads, whether in
incorporated or unincorporated areas, within a two (2) mile radius of the site of
the proposed rezoning.
D. No rezoning of land to the Industrial (I) District shall be permitted except on a specific
and documented finding that:
1. There is an inadequate supply of land zoned for these uses or the proposed use
cannot be accommodated by those sites due to lack of transportation, water, or
sewer, or that the market area to be served by the proposed use cannot be
efficiently served by the geographical location of the existing Industrial District.
2. Roads, floodplains, or other existing or planned features will insure sufficient
buffering to protect surrounding land and uses from the negative impacts of the
proposed industrial use.
E. If all owners in an existing subdivision or proposed subdivision located in any R, CDD,
DDH or RDD district petition the City Council for a Neighborhood Conservation District
designation, it may be granted.
IX-7
F. There shall be no rezoning of land from Rural to any other district until such time as
adequate public utilities are available.
906.02. Recommendation of the Planning Commission.
A. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council. Within 60
days of the Planning Commission rendering its recommendation to the City Council, the
City Council shall take action on the application, otherwise the application shall fail. The
City Council may elect to grant an extension for good cause. No amendment shall be
passed except by a majority vote of the members of the City Council present.
B. The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment
unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public interest and not
solely for the interest of the applicant.
C. For each disapproved map amendment, the Planning Commission shall make findings on
each of the following matters based on the evidence presented to it:
1. The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the
proposed zoning.
2. The adequacy of public facilities, such as sewer and water, and other required
public services.
Section 907. Variances.
907.01. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to empower the Board of Zoning Adjustment to vary or
adapt the strict application of any of the requirements of this Ordinance. It is expected that the granting of
variances will be rare; however, a variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and
exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of any regulation enacted
under this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such
property.
Those developments requiring a variance from any regulation of this Ordinance in conjunction with site
plan review shall have the appropriate request acted upon by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. This shall
include existing development sites, proposed for expansion or reconfiguration, which are nonconforming to
any requirement of this Ordinance. The site plan may be reviewed concurrently with review and action on
the variance request, but the site plan shall not be approved until the variance has been approved.
907.02. Application. Any property owner may apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance
using forms to be obtained from the Planning Department at least 15 days prior to the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Board.
907.03. Standards for Variances. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall grant no variance in the strict
application of the provision of this Ordinance unless it finds that the following requirements and standards
are satisfied. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall be
sparingly exercised. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the variance be used only to overcome some
exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty to its development and
prevents its owner from using the property as intended by the Zoning Ordinance. Any variance granted
shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical
difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In particular, the applicant shall establish
and substantiate that the appeal for the variance conforms to all of the requirements and standards listed
below:
IX-8
A. The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which it is located and shall
not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
B. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use, which is not
permitted in the district.
C. There must be proof of unique circumstances: there must exist special circumstances or
conditions fully described in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which
the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or
buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the district, and which
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building.
D. There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to
show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the
hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by
one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must result from the
application of this Ordinance; it must be suffered directly by the property in question; and
evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered.
E. That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or
building and that the variance as granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment is the
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
F. That the proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of
fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within
the adjacent neighborhood.
G. That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district.
The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the
regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
907.04. Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport. Any person desiring to erect or increase the
height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations
of this Section may apply to the Auburn Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations.
Applications for variances shall follow the same procedure for other variances. The application for a
variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the
Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable airspace.
A. Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed
development and determined its construction would exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the
board of adjustment may grant an airport obstruction variance for a proposed development. Such a variance
may be granted if the board determines that:
1. The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to
the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace
without adverse impact to surrounding environs)
IX-9
2. Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation.
3. Granting the variance will do substantial justice.
4. The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations.
All variances shall be subject to conditions and terms as recommended by the FAA.
B. The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be approved:
1. A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved
structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an
obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number
70/7460-1K, as it may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such
requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.)
for the affected structure.
2. The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid.
3. Consideration shall be given to:
a. The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures.
b. Public and private interests and investments.
c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports.
d. FAA designated federal airways.
e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the
minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport.
f. Technological advances.
g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air.
h. Land use density.
i. The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.
j. The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or
proposed structures identified in the City of Auburn.
k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the
FAA.
l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport.
m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts.
Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed
advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to
install, operate and maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the
presence of an airport hazard.
IX-10
907.05 Public Hearing. Upon application, the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall schedule a public hearing
on the proposed variance to be held ten (10) days after a public notice has been published in the local
newspaper, after signs announcing the public hearing have been erected on the property in question, and
after the adjacent property owners most affected by the variance request have been notified by certified
mail. The Board of Zoning Adjustment shall consider and decide all proposed variances taking into account
the standards enumerated above. After the close of a public hearing and within ten (10) days the Board of
Zoning Adjustment shall render a written decision, setting forth the reasons for such decision, which shall
be accompanied by finding of fact(s) specifying the reason(s) for such decision. All such decisions are final
and binding on all parties.
Section 908. Appeals.
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by any
provision of this Ordinance or by any decision, or any order to stop, cease, and desist, issued by the
Planning Director in enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance.
908.01. General Rules and Procedures for Appeals.
A. Any appeals from the ruling of the Planning Director concerning the enforcement and
interpretation of any provision of this Ordinance shall be filed with the Planning Director
within 15 days after the date of the Planning Directors decision thereon.
B. All appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing on forms prescribed by
the Board and accompanied by fees prescribed by resolution of the City Council.
C. All appeals and applications shall refer to the specific provisions of this Ordinance
involved.
D. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal and give due
notice thereof to the parties and shall render a written decision on the appeal without
unreasonable delay. The Board may affirm, reserve, wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination, as in its opinion it determines ought to be
done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken. The Planning Department shall maintain complete records of all appeal actions of
the Board.
E. Within ten (10) days after the close of a public hearing the Board shall render a written
decision giving the reason(s) for its decision.
F. In rendering a decision with respect to an appeal from any order, decision, or
determination the Board shall strictly interpret the language of the Ordinance and shall
find that the Planning Director was correct in his decision or in error. However, the
Board shall not render any decision which shall modify an order, decision, or
determination which confers rights or privileges on the appellant that are not otherwise
permissible under the strict interpretation of this language of this Ordinance.
G. Such decision shall be submitted to the appellant and the Planning Director.
908.02. All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding on all parties. No request for a
variance or appeal of an administrative decision shall be reheard, and no further application shall be
accepted, once a decision has been given, except under one or more of the following conditions:
A. New evidence or information pertinent to the request has been discovered which was not
available to the applicant at the time of the original hearing.
IX-11
B. The decision resulted from an error in procedures required by the Ordinance or State law
made by the Board, the Planning Director, or any other City official.
C. The decision resulted from an error in substantive law under the provisions of this
Ordinance or the Code of Alabama.
Where no error is alleged and no new evidence is available a new or more effective presentation by the
applicant shall not constitute grounds for rehearing a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Any
applicant wishing a rehearing shall appear before the Board to present one or more of the qualifying
conditions listed in this Section.
If the Board finds that one or more of these conditions exists, the applicant shall be permitted to submit a
new application, together with the required fees. The new application shall be heard at a subsequent
meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements. Allowing a new
application does not obligate the Board to grant the request.
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board may within 15 days after such decision appeal to the
Circuit Court having jurisdiction.
Section 909. Penalties.
Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not
more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine
and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
909.01. Any person who fails to obtain a Zoning Certificate or other permit prior to beginning construction
or erecting any structure or sign shall be subject to doubling of all applicable fees.
