PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of North Miami of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1958 Code, as supplemented through July 12, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1958 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code are conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A Table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code are included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is numbered 6-1 and the third section of Chapter 7 is 7-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 8-1 and 8-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-1.1, 8-1.2 and 8-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 10 and 11, it will be designated as Chapter 10.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Clair T. Singerman, CMC, former City Clerk, David Wolpin, City Attorney, Cheryl M. Rogers, Former City Clerk, and the other members of the staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Code Cross reference- Charter board, § 2-81 et seq. 

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 

Sec. 1. - Preamble. 
    The citizens of the City of North Miami, in order to protect the health, welfare and safety of its residents, and promote honorable, efficient and responsive government, hereby adopt this charter amending, replacing and superseding all of its former charters, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida. 
Sec. 2. - Effect of this charter on existing law. 
(a)  All laws and parts of laws relating to or affecting the City of North Miami in force when this charter shall take effect are hereby repealed and superseded to the extent that the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this charter. 
(b)  Insofar as the provisions of this charter are the same in terms or in substance and effect as provisions of law in force when this charter shall take effect, relating to or affecting the City of North Miami, the provisions of this charter are intended to be not a new enactment but a continuation of such provisions of law, and this charter shall be so construed and applied. 
Sec. 3. - Severability clause. 
    If any section or part of section of this charter shall be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the remainder of this charter nor the context in which such section or part of section so held invalid may appear, except to the extent that an entire section or part of section may be inseparably connected in meaning and effect with the section or part of section to which such holding shall directly apply. 
Sec. 4. - Construction of gender. 
    The use of masculine or feminine gender throughout the charter is used only for stylistic convenience, and is to be interpreted as including the female gender as well as the masculine gender. 
Sec. 5. - Incorporation. 
    There is hereby created a municipal corporation to be known as the City of North Miami. 
Sec. 6. - Form of government. 
    The municipal government provided by this charter shall be known as the "council-manager government." Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the state Constitution and by this charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in an elective council. 
Sec. 7. - Boundaries. 
    The corporate limits of the City of North Miami in Miami-Dade County, Florida are hereby fixed, defined and established so as to include the following lands and territories in said County of Miami-Dade in the State of Florida, to wit: 
    The boundary description of the city, which may be amended from time to time, is not printed herein, but is on file in the city clerk's office. 
Sec. 8. - Powers of the city. 
(a)  The city shall have all the powers granted to municipal corporations and to cities by the Constitution and general laws of the state, together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted.

No property of the city shall be sold for less than ninety (90) percent of the appraised value of the property as determined by at least two (2) city secured MAI appraisals. Except as prohibited by the Constitution of this state or restricted by this charter, the city shall and may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every name and nature whatsoever. The enumeration of particular powers by this charter shall not be deemed to be exclusive, and in addition to the powers enumerated therein or implied thereby, or appropriate to the exercise of such powers, it is intended that the city shall have and may exercise all powers, which, under the Constitution of this state, it would be competent for this charter specifically to enumerate. 
(b)  Said city shall have and is granted the rights and powers: 
(1)  To establish, lay out, open, grade, pave, curb, widen, maintain, and keep clean and sanitary, and otherwise improve and to abandon or vacate, streets, alleys, bridges, sidewalks, parks, parkways, promenades, and other public places and ways. 
(2)  To prevent obstructions in and regulate travel, trade and traffic in, over or upon any or all such ways including the power to regulate the weight, equipment, operation and speed of engines, trains, motor and other vehicles operating in or through the city. 
(3)  To require any and all wires, pipes and other facilities to be placed and maintained underground. 
(4)  To require carriers to install and maintain at their expense adequate warning lights, gates and signals or watchmen, where deemed necessary.

ARTICLE II. - CITIZENS' BILL OF RIGHTS 

Sec. 9. - Citizens' Bill of Rights. 
(a)  This government has been created to protect the governed, not the governing. In order to provide the public with full and accurate information, to promote efficient administrative management, to make government more accountable, and to insure to all persons fair and equitable treatment, the following rights are guaranteed: 
1.  Convenient access. Every person has the right to transact business with the city with a minimum of personal inconvenience. It shall be the duty of the city manager and the city council to provide, within the city's budget limitations, reasonably convenient times and places for required inspections, and for transacting business with the city. 
2.  Truth in government. No municipal official or employee shall knowingly furnish false information on any public matter, nor knowingly omit significant facts when giving requested information to members of the public. 
3.  Public records. All audits, reports, minutes, documents and other public records of the city and its boards, agencies, departments and authorities shall be open for inspection at reasonable time and places convenient to the public. 
4.  Minutes and ordinance register. The city clerk shall maintain and make available for public inspection an ordinance register separate from the minutes showing the votes of each member on all ordinances and resolutions listed by descriptive title. Written minutes of all meetings and the ordinance register shall be available for public inspection not later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the meeting. 
5.  Right to be heard. So far as the orderly conduct of public business permits, any interested person has the right to appear before the city council or any city agency, board or department for the presentation, adjustment or determination of an issue, request or controversy within the jurisdiction of the city. Matters shall be scheduled for the convenience of the public, and the agenda shall be divided into approximate time periods so that the public may know approximately when a matter will be heard. Nothing shall prohibit the city or any agency from imposing reasonable time limits for the presentation of a matter. 
6.  Right to notice. Persons entitled to notice of a city hearing shall be timely informed as to the time, place and nature of the hearing and the legal authority pursuant to which the hearing is to be held. Failure by an individual to receive such notice shall not constitute mandatory grounds for canceling the hearing or rendering invalid any determination made at such hearing. Copies of proposed ordinances or resolutions shall be made available at a reasonable time prior to the hearing, unless the matter involves an emergency ordinance or resolution. 
7.  No unreasonable postponements. No matter once having been placed on a formal agenda by the city shall be postponed to another day except for good cause shown in the opinion of the city council, or agency conducting such meeting, and then only on condition that any person so requesting is mailed adequate notice of the new date of any postponed meeting. Failure by an individual to receive such notice shall not constitute mandatory grounds for canceling the hearing or rendering invalid any determination made at such hearing. 
8.  Right to public hearing. Upon a timely request of any interested party a public hearing shall be held by any city agency, board, department or authority upon any significant policy decision to be issued by it which is not subject to subsequent administrative or legislative review and hearing. This provision shall not apply to the Office of the City Attorney of the city nor to anybody whose duties and responsibilities are solely advisory. 
At any zoning or other hearing in which review is exclusively by certiorari, a party or his counsel shall be entitled to present a case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The decision of any such agency, board, department or authority must be based upon the facts in the record. Procedural rules establishing reasonable time and other limitations may be promulgated and amended from time to time. 
9.  Notice of action and reasons. Prompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a request of an interested person made in connection with any municipal administrative decision or proceeding when the decision is reserved at the conclusion of the hearing. The notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the grounds for denial. 
10.  Managers' and attorneys' reports. The city manager and city attorney shall periodically make a public status report on all major matters pending or concluded within their respective offices, except as to any matters which may be privileged, pursuant to law. 
11.  Budgeting. In addition to any budget required by state statute, the city manager shall prepare a budget showing the cost of each department for each budget year. Prior to the city council's first public hearing on the proposed budget required by state law, the city manager shall make public a budget summary setting forth the proposed cost of each individual department and reflecting the personnel for each, the purposes and the estimated cost of each department. 
12.  Adequate audits. An annual audit of the city shall be made by an independent certified public accounting firm in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The independent city auditor shall be appointed by the city council; both appointment and removal of the independent city auditor shall be made by the city council. A summary of the results of the independent city auditor's annual audit, including any deficiencies found, shall be made public. In making such audit, proprietary functions shall be audited separately and adequate depreciation on proprietary facilities shall be accrued so the public may determine the amount of any direct or indirect subsidy. 
13.  Representation of public. The city council shall endeavor to provide representation at all proceedings significantly affecting the city and its residents before state, federal or county regulatory bodies. 
(b)  The foregoing enumeration of citizens' rights vests large and pervasive powers in the citizenry of the City of North Miami. Such power necessarily carries with it responsibility of equal magnitude for the successful operation of government in the city. The orderly, efficient and fair operation of government requires the intelligent participation of individual citizens exercising their rights with dignity and restraint so as to avoid any sweeping acceleration in the cost of government because of the exercise of individual prerogatives, and for individual citizens to grant respect for the dignity of public office. 
(c)  Remedies for violations. In any suit by a citizen alleging a violation of this Bill of Rights filed in the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court pursuant to its general equity jurisdiction, the plaintiff, if successful, shall be entitled to recover costs as fixed by the court. Any public official or employee who is found by the court to have willfully violated this article shall forthwith forfeit such office or employment. 
(d)  Construction. All provisions of this article shall be construed to be supplementary to and not in conflict with the general laws of Florida. If any part of this article shall be declared invalid, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

Sec. 50. - Effect of certification of referendum petition. 
    When a referendum petition, or amended petition as defined in section 72 of this charter, has been certified as sufficient by the city clerk, the ordinance specified in the petition shall not go into effect, or further action thereunder shall be suspended if it shall have gone into effect, until and unless approved by the electors, as hereinafter provided.

The council shall take final action on the ordinance not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which such ordinance was submitted to the council by the city clerk. A referred ordinance shall be reconsidered by the council and its final vote upon such reconsideration shall be upon the question, "Shall the ordinance specified in the referendum petition be repealed?" 
Sec. 52. - Submission to electors.

The ballot used in voting upon any ordinance, if a paper ballot, shall have below the ballot title the following propositions, one (1) above the other, in the order indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE" and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE." Immediately at the left of each proposition there shall be a square in which by making a cross (X) the elector may vote for or against the ordinance. Any number of ordinances may be voted on at the same election and may be submitted on the same ballot, but any paper ballot used for voting thereon shall be for that purpose only. If voting machines are used, the ballot title of any ordinance shall have below it the same two (2) propositions, one (1) above the other or one (1) preceding the other in the order indicated, and the elector shall be given an opportunity to vote for either of the two (2) propositions and thereby to vote for or against the ordinance. 
Sec. 54. - Availability of list of qualified electors. 
    If any organization or group requests it for the purpose of circulating descriptive matter relating to the ordinance to be voted on, the board of elections or city clerk or other office, department or agency of the city having the list of qualified electors shall either permit such organization or group to copy the names and addresses of the qualified electors or furnish it with a list thereof. 
Sec. 55. - Results of election. 
    If a majority of the electors voting on a proposed initiative ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon be an ordinance of the city. A referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If conflicting ordinances are approved by the electors at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
Sec. 56. - Repealing ordinances; publication. 
    Initiative and referendum ordinances adopted or approved by the electors shall be published as in the case of other ordinances, and may be amended or repealed by the unanimous vote of the entire council.

    The flood damage prevention ordinance is hereby created and adopted. 
(Ord. No. 877, Art. 1, § A, 9-22-92) 
Sec. 8.5-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of North Miami are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 877, Art. 1, § B, 9-22-92) 
Sec. 8.5-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 877, Art. 1, § C, 9-22-92; Ord. No. 1129, § 1, 5-13-03) 
Sec. 8.5-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and; 
(7)  To ensure potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value, as determined, by a state certified appraiser, of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) the assessed value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (3) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
    X-Zone means an area of minimum or moderate flood hazard above the base flood elevation, which does not meet the criteria of a Special Flood Hazard Area. For purposes of this chapter, base flood elevation in an X-Zone shall be equivalent to the elevation of the crown of the road abutting a property plus one (1) foot. 
    Zone of imminent collapse means an area subject to erosion adjacent to the shoreline of an ocean, bay, or lake and within a distance equal to ten (10) feet plus five (5) times the average annual longterm erosion rate for the site, measured from the reference feature. 
    30-year setback means a distance equal to thirty (30) times the average annual long term recession rate at a site, measured from the reference feature. 
    60-year setback means a distance equal to sixty (60) times the average annual long term recession rate at a site, measured from the reference feature.

Sec. 8.5-46. - Calculating substantial improvement and damage. 
(1)  Substantial improvement. An addition or renovation shall be considered a substantial improvement when the costs of improving the structure exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building: 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the costs of improvements for a project shall be obtained from one of the following sources: 
1.  Detailed cost estimate from the licensed general contractor of record; or 
2.  Professional construction estimation software, such as Marshall and Swift or the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) residential substantial damage estimation program. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, the following sources will be considered acceptable estimates of market value: 
1.  An independent appraisal by a professional appraiser. The appraisal must exclude the value of the land and not use the "income capitalization approach" which bases value on the use of the property, not the structure. 
2.  Detailed estimates of the structure's actual cash value - the replacement cost for a building, minus a depreciation percentage based on the age and condition. 
3.  Property appraisals used for tax assessment purposes with an adjustment recommended by the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser to reflect market conditions (adjusted assessed value). 
(c)  For structures in which the substantial improvement percentage is greater than or equal to forty (40) percent, a more precise market value may be required. 
(2)  Substantial damage. Damage to a structure, including damage from demolition, in which the cost to repair exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building: 
(a)  Cost to repair a structure shall be calculated for full repair to the building before damage condition, even when the owner elects not to restore the building to its prior state. Cost to repair shall also include the cost of any improvement that the owner has opted to include during the repair project. For the purposes of this section, the cost to repair shall be obtained from one of the following objective third party sources: 
1.  A licensed general contractor; 
2.  Professional construction estimation software, such as Marshall and Swift or the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) residential substantial damage estimation program; 
3.  Insurance adjustment papers; or 
4.  Damage assessment field surveys conducted by building inspection, emergency management or tax assessment agencies after a disaster. 
(b)  Market value shall be calculated as set forth in section 8.5-43 (1)(b), above. 
(c)  For structures in which the substantial damage percentage is greater than or equal to forty (40) percent, a more precise market value may be required. 
(3)  Exclusions regarding substantial improvement. The term substantial improvement shall not, however, include either: 
(a)  Functionally dependent structures; 
(b)  Alteration of historic structures provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; or 
(c)  Restrooms in public parks.

    In areas of special flood hazard other than coastal high hazard, residential and commercial X-Zones, where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 8.5-31(b), or section 8.5-43(11), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement (A) elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or the crown of the road abutting the property, whichever is greater, or, (B) elevated no lower than two (2) feet above base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the equalization of hydrostatic forces on two (2) sides of exterior walls in accordance with standards of section 8.5-52(3). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement (A) elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or the crown of the road abutting the property, whichever is greater, or (B) Elevated no lower than two (2) feet above base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 8.5-43(9). An operational plan shall be included to describe the installation of the flood proofing measures. 
(3)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
(a)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. 
(b)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
3.  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of subsection 4(b)1., and 3. above. 
(c)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 4(b)1., and 3., above. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 8.5-31(b), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
(b)  If section 8.5-52(5)(a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all flood damage prevention provisions of section 8.5-52. 
(c)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision, except where otherwise required by law and required by the city's comprehensive land use master plan. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 8.5-51(2), and the elevation standards of section 8.5-52 (1) and (2) and the encroachment standards of section 8.5-52(5)(a), are met. 
(6)  Coastal high hazard areas (V zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8.5-31(b), are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  All buildings shall be located twenty-five (25) feet landward of the reach of the mean high tide; 
(b)  All buildings shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with all space below the lowest horizontal structural member open so as not to impede the flow of water. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with section 8.5-52(6)(h); 
(c)  All buildings or structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns; 
(d)  All pile and column foundations and structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values shall equal or exceed the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with Florida Building Code, current edition; 
(e)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in section 8.5-52(6)(b), (c) and (d) of this article; 
(f)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Noncompacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
1.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
2.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
3.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(g)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage; 
(h)  Lattice work or decorative screening shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used and provided the following design specifications are met: 
1.  No solid walls shall be allowed, and; 
2.  Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only. 
(i)  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, such enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises; 
(j)  Prior to construction, plans for any buildings that will have lattice work or decorative screening must be submitted to the building official for approval; 
(k)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with lattice work or decorative screening, as provided for in section 8.5-52(6)(h) and (i); 
(l)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile home) park or subdivision, except where otherwise required by law and required by the City's Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 8.5-52(6)(e), and the elevation standards of section 8.5-52(6)(b) are met.

That estimate shall be broken down on a percentage basis into an estimate of the following critical elements of construction, as applicable: structural, roofing, other building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical ("valuation of construction components"). The cost of completion, alteration, repair or replacement shall be estimated by application of the percentage of deterioration found on site for each of the critical elements of construction to the valuation of construction components for the structure, to arrive at an overall estimated cost to repair the affected structure. The appointing authority shall by administrative order provide a form for the application of the formula set forth above for the various types of construction. 
(3)  If a building or structure may be repaired and made safe pursuant to the valuation criteria set forth above, and the building or structure is otherwise unsafe in accordance with the physical criteria set forth in this section, the building official may order such building or structure to be temporarily secured in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth in this section. Such building must be completed and brought into full compliance with the most current approved version of the Florida Building Code within such time as the building official or the unsafe structures board may determine to be reasonable for such completion. If the building or structure is not temporarily secured, completed and brought into full compliance with the most current approved version of the Florida Building Code within the reasonable periods allowed, such building or structure shall be demolished and removed from the premises. 
(e)  Inspection of unsafe buildings and structures. The building official, on his own initiative or as a result of reports by others, shall examine or cause to be examined every building or structure appearing or reported to be unsafe, and if such is found to be an unsafe building or structure as defined in this section, the building official shall proceed in the manner set forth in this section. 
(f)  Emergency action. When in the opinion of the building official, there is actual or immediate danger of the failure or collapse of a building or structure, or there is a health, windstorm or fire hazard, he may order the occupants to vacate, temporarily close for use or occupancy the rights-of-way thereto, sidewalks, streets or adjacent buildings or nearby area and institute such other temporary safeguards, including securing the building or structure, as he may deem necessary under the circumstances, and may employ the necessary labor and materials to perform the required work as expeditiously as possible. In such event, the operation of the notice and hearing requirements of this section shall be suspended as reasonably necessary in the opinion of the building official to redress the emergency situation. Costs incurred in the performance of such emergency work shall be paid by the appropriate governmental authority and upon the recording in the public records of this county a certificate executed by the building official, certifying the amount so expended, the same shall become a lien against the property involved. 
(g)  Unsafe structures meeting valuation criteria for immediate demolition. 
(1)  The provisions of this subsection (f) shall apply to structures meeting the valuation criteria for demolition set forth above. 
(2)  The building official shall prepare a notice of violation. The notice shall state in summary form the nature of the defects which constitute a violation of this section and shall order the structure to be demolished within such time as is reasonable, subject to extension when requested in writing within the reasonable discretion of the building official. The notice shall state that the specific details concerning the violations can be obtained in writing from the building official upon request. In addition, the notice will explain the right of appeal of the decision of the building official to the unsafe structures board and advise that unless the decision is appealed, the building or structure shall be demolished without further notice.

The hearing shall not be scheduled earlier than thirty (30) days following the date of posting of the notice of hearing and notice of violation. 
(4)  The building official shall post a notice bearing his or her facsimile signature in a conspicuous location on the building or structure that has been determined to be unsafe.

(5)  Within ten (10) working days of posting the notice of violation and notice of hearing, the building official shall send written notice of violation and notice of hearing to the owner and any interested party. For these purposes, the owner shall be the taxpayer as reflected in the most recently certified real property ad valorem tax roll of Miami-Dade County; provided however, where the records of the Dade County property appraiser indicate that ownership has changed, the owner shall be the taxpayer as reflected in those records. An interested party shall be the owner and any other person or entity who has previously requested real property ad valorem tax notices with respect to the subject property in accordance with F.S. § 197.344, as the same may be renumbered or amended from time to time. The notice of violation and notice of hearing shall be sent by certified or first class mail to all such parties' last known addresses as reflected in the records of the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. Failure to receive such notice, or the lack of a signed return receipt shall not invalidate the notice. 
(6)  Upon expiration of the period of appeal provided in the notice of violation, the building official may file an appropriate instrument in the office of the clerk of the circuit court to be recorded in the public records of this county, indicating that the property is in violation of the Building Code. The recording of the notice shall constitute constructive notice of the violation to all concerned, subsequent purchasers, transferees, mortgagees, lessees, grantees and all persons claiming or acquiring interest in the property. In the event that the violation is corrected, the building official shall file proof of the same upon payment for fees incurred. 
(7)  The building official shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation and post in the lobby of North Miami City Hall. The published notice shall contain the address of the subject property and the names of the owner and any interested party, and state that the subject property has been found to be in violation of the Florida Building Code and subject to demolition. The published notice shall also state the time and place of the hearing scheduled before the unsafe structures board. 
(8)  The notices provided in this section are intended to serve as full and effective notice of the hearing and the violations related to the structure. Failure of one (1) form of notice shall not invalidate or impair the full effectiveness of notice provided by other means pursuant to this section.

(1)  If a building or structure may be repaired and made safe pursuant to the valuation criteria set forth above, and the building or structure is otherwise unsafe in accordance with the physical criteria set forth in this section, the building official may order such building or structure to be temporarily secured in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth in this section. Such building must be completed and brought into full compliance with the most current version of the Florida Building Code within such time as the building official or the unsafe structures board may determine to be reasonable for such completion.

(3)  The notice of violation shall be affixed to the structure concerned. 
(4)  Within ten (10) working days of posting the notice of violation, the building official shall send the written notice of violation to the owner and any interested party, in the same manner provided in subsection (f)(5) above. 
(5)  In the event that the building or structure is not secured or brought into compliance with the requirements of the most current version of the Florida Building Code within the periods specified in the notice of violation, and no application for extension is made in the manner set forth in this section, the building official may schedule the case for hearing before the unsafe structures board to secure an order for demolition of the building or structure or to obtain any other appropriate remedy. 
(6)  In the event that the building official requests that the secretary to the board or director of the building department or his designee schedule a hearing, or in the event that the owner or interested party files a timely appeal of the decision of the building official, the secretary to the board or director of the building department or his designee shall issue a notice of hearing which shall be affixed to the property, mailed to the owner and interested party, in the same manner provided in subsections (f)(3) and (f)(5) above. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the same manner provided in subsection (f)(7) above.

(8)  The periods set forth in the notice of violation for bringing the structure into compliance with the Building Code may be extended by the building official for one (1) or more additional periods which in the aggregate do not exceed an additional one hundred eighty (180) days provided all of the conditions of this subsection are met. Application for the extension must be made in writing by the interested party to the building official prior to the expiration of the period allowed for compliance, and shall set forth to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official that the extension is warranted by one (1) or more of the following circumstances: 
a.  The interested party has a demonstrated financial hardship that will prevent the interested party from completing a building or structure; 
b.  The building or structure is a multiple dwelling structure as defined in the Florida Building Code and demolition of any unit comprising that structure compromises the structural integrity of the entire multi-unit structure, where the completion of the structure is outside of the control of the interested party; 
c.  The building or structure is the subject of pending litigation or foreclosure action that renders it impossible for the building or structure to be completed; 
d.  The building or structure is the subject of a good faith insurance claim, the proceeds of which are intended to be utilized for repair and completion; 
e.  The building or structure is the subject of a pending sale to be closed within a reasonable time from the date the extension is requested, where the buyer has executed a written commitment to the building official to complete the structure within the applicable extension period. 
The written application for extension shall further represent to the building official that the building or structure is and has at all times been in full compliance with all of the conditions set forth in this subsection. 
(9)  Upon receipt of the written application, the building official shall be authorized to extend the date of full completion and compliance with the Building Code provided: 
a.  The completed written application demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official that one (1) or more of the conditions set forth above exist with respect to the building or structure; 
b.  The building or structure is not open, vacant or abandoned, having been secured at doors and windows in a manner acceptable to the building official; and 
c.  The interested party has paid all reasonable costs of enforcement. 
(10)  Any interested party may appeal to the unsafe structures board or unsafe structures appeal panel a decision to grant or deny the extension. Such appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of mailing of the building official's written notice of his or her decision with respect to the application for extension.

The board may modify, rescind, or uphold the decision of the building official as recited in the notice of violation. The unsafe structures board shall modify or rescind a decision of the building official only upon a finding that the building official was in error in the interpretation or application of the Florida Building Code. The board shall not exceed the time frames allowed for repair and completion of buildings and structures specifically set forth in this section except where the work involved reasonably requires such additional time. 
(3)  A copy of the order shall be forwarded to the owner, and all interested parties by registered or certified mail, and a copy thereof posted on the premises. 
(4)  If the owner or those responsible shall fail to comply with the order of the unsafe structures board within the time stipulated therein and such order is to repair, complete or secure the building to make safe, then the building official shall cause such building to be vacated, if occupied; and shall through his employees or through a contractor enforce the order of the unsafe structures board or building official. Buildings shall be secured with concrete block or other materials of the same durability as determined by the building official. Swimming pools shall be secured by fencing or by using another approved method as determined by the building official. 
(5)  If the order of the unsafe structures board is to demolish the building or structure and to remove the salvage, contents, debris and abandoned property from the premises, and the owner or those responsible shall have failed to comply with such order, then the building official may do so.

(6)  The building official may either sell to the highest bidder or bidders for cash the salvage and the contents of such building or other structure so demolished which have not been removed by the owner of the land or require the demolition contractor to dispose of the salvage and the contents of the structure demolished. 
(j)  Multi-unit structures. 
(1)  This subsection shall be applicable to all multi-unit structures.

In the event that the owner or other interested party fails to comply with any order of the unsafe structures board in connection with any multi-unit structure, then in addition to any other right or remedy contained in this section, the city shall be authorized, but not required, to secure the structure in the manner set forth in this subsection. In addition, and not in derogation of the use of other methods contemplated by this section for enforcing the most current version of the Florida Building Code with respect to any structure, multi-unit structures may be secured by performing whatever work the building official may determine is reasonably necessary to preserve the structural integrity, water tightness, or safety of adjacent units or the surrounding community, which work may include, but not be limited to roofing, windows, and electrical. 
(2)  The procedures for enforcement of this code set forth above shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, other procedures available to the building official pursuant to the Building Code.

(5)  Except with respect to a lien imposed in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be construed as placing a lien upon property that supersedes the lien of any mortgage on such property executed and recorded prior to the existence of a lien for enforcement costs.

Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rules which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. 
l.  Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. 
m.  The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now, or hereafter may be, recognized in civil actions; and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

The board shall not be authorized to extend any deadline for compliance, set forth in the order, unless the secretary of the board receives the written request for extension prior to the deadline specified in the initial order. For example, in the event the board order states that a permit must be obtained within a specified period, the request for extension of the deadline to obtain the permit must be received prior to the expiration of that specified period. If the same order provides a deadline for completion of the structure, the request for the extension for the deadline of completion must be received prior to the deadline for completion, provided that the applicant has complied with the permit deadline. In no event may the board or appeal panel grant more than one (1) extension of time for each initial order. 
    To obtain an extension, the owner or applicant must demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the board that the structure that is the subject of the order is secure at the time the extension is sought and that the owner or applicant has made a good faith attempt to comply with the order which has been impeded by changed circumstances or other circumstances outside of the owner or applicant's control. As a further condition of the extension, the owner or applicant must submit in writing, together with the petition for an extension, a written timetable for compliance with the substantive provisions of the order and for completion of all necessary repairs. The board shall not reconsider the order, limiting its consideration of the petition to deciding whether the grounds for an extension have been satisfied in the manner set forth in this subsection. 
(o)  Judicial review. Any owner or authorized representative aggrieved by a decision of the unsafe structures board may seek judicial review of that decision in accordance with Rule 9.110(c) of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Accordingly, any order, requirement, decision, denial of a request for extension of time, or determination of the unsafe structures board shall be reviewed by the filing of a notice of appeal in the Circuit Court Appellate Division of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, within thirty (30) days of rendition of the order. This 30-day time frame commences to run from the date that the board's or appeal panel's order, requirement, decision or determination sought to be reviewed is transmitted to the secretary and such timeframe shall not be tolled or otherwise affected by any request for extension of time for compliance set forth in subsection (n) above. The secretary or the building official of the building department shall affix to each order, requirement, decision or determination [of the board the date said order, requirement, decision or determination] is transmitted. Moreover, the secretary to the board and building official of the building department shall comply with all requirements of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Sec. 12-40. - Squatting prohibited. 
    Squatting is a public nuisance and is prohibited in the city. 
(Ord. No. 1376, § 1, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 12-41. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to proactively address the issue of squatting as a public nuisance and provide remedies for its occurrence. Unauthorized occupation of a residence by squatters poses numerous public safety concerns to the lawful owner or lessee and to the community as a whole. This article is intended to prevent future instances of squatting and to ensure that provisions are in place to remove squatters promptly from properties.

(Ord. No. 1376, § 1, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 12-45. - Evidentiary hearing. 
    If the alleged squatter(s) remain at the property after written notice, a hearing shall be held to determine whether the occupants of the property have been authorized by the property owner to remain at the property, as follows: 
(1)  Written notice to appear and show cause why the occupants are entitled to remain at the property shall be delivered to the property owner and the occupants of the property in accordance with the notice provisions provided in F.S. ch. 162. 
(2)  The hearing shall be held no sooner than five (5) days after service of the notice to show cause. The hearing shall be conducted by the special magistrate in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 2 of this Code. 
(3)  The special magistrate shall consider all evidence and testimony to determine whether the property owner has authorized the occupant to remain in the property. 
(4)  Squatting may be presumed where the occupant of the property is unable to produce a written document, such as a lease, license, or other written proof of authorization from the property owner or lessee, demonstrating that the occupant has permission to be on the property. Squatting may also be presumed where a property is listed as vacant on the abandoned property registry, and yet is occupied. Such presumptions may be rebutted if the occupant provides competent, substantial evidence demonstrating authorization to be in the premises. The presumptions stated herein are not the exclusive method for determining whether squatting is occurring on a specific property. 
(5)  If the special magistrate finds that the occupants are legally authorized by the property owner to remain in the property, that no threat to public safety or public nuisance exists, or that the property owner is in the process of taking legal action to remove the squatters, the action shall be dismissed. 
(6)  If the special magistrate finds that property owner has not authorized the occupants of the property to remain in the property, or that a threat to public safety or public nuisance exists and has not been corrected, an order shall be issued determining that the occupants are squatters, and ordering the squatters to depart from the premises. 
(7)  If the squatters refuse to depart after being issued an order by the special magistrate, they may be prosecuted for criminal trespass and the city may file a civil action in the appropriate court to enforce the order of the special magistrate or take any other action provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 1376, § 1, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 12-46. - Enforcement of criminal trespass statutes and removal of squatters.

Persons who have been issued a warning by the North Miami Police Department to depart and refuse to do so, will be arrested and prosecuted for criminal trespass under F.S. § 810.08. 
(Ord. No. 1376, § 1, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 12-47. - Other remedies.

Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 1313, adopted Feb. 22, 2011, amended Art. III in its entirety, in effect repealing §§ 13-26-13-30 and enacting similar new provisions in lieu thereof as §§ 13-26 and 13-27. Formerly, such provisions derived from Ord. No. 1184, § 1, adopted June 28, 2005. 

Sec. 13-26. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders and sexual predators, sexual offenders and sexual predators who use physical violence, and sexual offenders and sexual predators who prey on children present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders and sexual predators are likely to use physical violence and repeat their offenses, and many sexual offenders and sexual predators commit offenses that go unreported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender and sexual predator victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence, loitering or prowling in child safety zones. Therefore, in accordance with Miami-Dade County regulations, the provisions of article XVII, chapter 21, Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances, as amended, shall have full force and effect within the corporate limits of the city.

Sec. 13-27. - Disclosure requirement. 
(a)  The city shall, on a daily basis or as often as reasonably possible, download a list of newly released convicted sexual offenders and sexual predators and post same on its web page, and identify, by name, address and any other non-exempt information, all convicted sexual offenders and sexual predators who live or relocate within the North Miami jurisdiction. The city shall keep this posting updated as often as reasonably possible so as to provide the public with the most current information. 
(b)  In addition to releasing information about newly released convicted sexual offenders and sexual predators on its web page as provided in subsection (a) above, the city shall, on a quarterly basis, notify city residents by U.S. mail of all convicted sexual offenders and sexual predators residing within the city. Such notice shall disclose the name and address of the convicted sexual offender and sexual predator. The city shall also download the newly released flyers from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which identify convicted sexual offenders and sexual predators, and post same in conspicuous locations at all educational facilities and city facilities. The flyers shall be updated bi-weekly or as often as reasonably possible.

(b)  Any member may on his early service retirement date elect to have the commencement of his membership service allowance deferred until age sixty-five (65) in which event he will receive a membership service allowance beginning at age sixty-five (65) and payable monthly for the remainder of his lifetime in such amount as shall be determined by the actuary as being the actuarial equivalent at age sixty-five (65) of his member-ship service reserve upon the attainment of age sixty-five (65). 
(c)  Any member may, on his disability retirement date, provided he has completed at least fifteen (15) years' service in the employ of the city, elect to have the commencement of his membership service allowance deferred until his normal service retirement date, or his early service retirement date, as provided in subsection 15-39(a) and subsection 15-39(b). However, any member who recovers from any such disability may reenter the active employ of the city within thirty (30) days of such recovery. He shall thereafter be a member of the system and he shall make his required contributions to the fund. Such reemployment shall revoke his previous election to have his membership service allowance deferred because of disability. 
(Code 1958, § 19-8) 
Sec. 15-42. - Prior service allowances. 
(a)  Each member in the service of the city on the effective date shall become entitled, upon his normal service retirement date, in addition to any other benefits hereunder, to a prior service allowance which shall become payable commencing on his normal service retirement date and which shall be continued monthly for the remainder of his lifetime. Such a prior service allowance shall be determined by multiplying (1) times (2) as follows: 
(1)  Two (2) percent of the monthly rate of compensation of the member as of the effective date, multiplied by 
(2)  The number of years prior service credited to the member. 
(b)  Any member who shall elect to retire on his early service retirement date and who does not defer the commencement of his membership service allowance until age sixty-five (65) shall have his prior service allowance commence at his early service retirement date but such allowance shall be reduced in amount as determined by the actuary so as to be the actuarial equivalent of the prior service allowance which he would have received had he retired on his normal service retirement date. 
(c)  Any member who defers his retirement beyond the normal service retirement date shall receive the same prior service allowance, commencing at his deferred service retirement date, that he would have received had he retired on his normal service retirement date. 
(d)  Should a member's employment with the city be terminated because of abolition of his position following transfer of services to Miami-Dade County government, whether such member has been accepted for employment with Metropolitan Dade County or not, provided he did not reject county employment with duties, responsibilities and level of compensation equivalent to those held with the City of North Miami on his own volition, the member shall be kept active on the books of the North Miami employee retirement system with respect to prior service allowance only, and may apply for and be paid at age sixty-five (65) the prior service allowance established for him, or at age fifty-five (55) at a reduced amount determined by the actuary so as to be the actuarial equivalent of the prior service allowance which he would have received had he applied at age sixty-five (65). Equivalency of duties, responsibilities, and level of compensation shall be determined by the personnel department and approved by a majority vote of the pension system advisory committee. Those members who are not accepted for county employment shall obtain a certificate from the Dade County personnel department indicating that the member had sought county employment but had been disqualified, stating the reason for disqualification. 
(e)  Any member who was in the service of the city on May 1, 1956, at the establishment of the retirement system for employees of the City of North Miami, who has completed ten (10) years of service and who terminates under the provisions of section 15-29, shall be entitled to receive a prior service allowance calculated according to the formula in section 15-39. This prior service allowance shall commence at age sixty-five (65) unless the member elects by written notice to the personnel department to draw an actuarially reduced allowance commencing no earlier than age fifty-five (55) and continued monthly for the remainder of his lifetime. 
(Code 1958, § 19-9) 
Sec. 15-43. - Optional modes of service allowance. 
(a)  Each member shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, at least three (3) months prior to his service retirement, to elect to have both his membership service allowance and prior service allowance payable under either of the options hereinafter set forth in lieu of the monthly allowances otherwise payable to him upon service retirement under any of the provisions herein. The amount of any optional service retirement allowances shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such allowances otherwise payable to him hereunder. The member shall make such an election by written request to the personnel department and such an election will be subject to the approval of the pension system advisory committee. 
(1)  Option A. Joint and last survivor option. A member may elect to receive a decreased monthly allowance during his lifetime and have such decreased monthly allowance or a designated fraction thereof continued after his death to his beneficiary during the remaining lifetime of the beneficiary. This option may not be elected by a member if the social security option following has previously been elected. 
(2)  Option B. Social Security option. If a member retires prior to his normal service retirement date, he may elect to receive increased monthly allowances up to age sixty-five (65) and decreased monthly allowances thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more nearly level monthly allowance when such decreased monthly allowances are added to his primary benefits under the federal social security act. The election of this option will automatically revoke any election under the joint and last survivor option above. 
(b)  The election by a member of any of the options above shall be null and void if the member dies prior to service retirement. Option A shall not be voided in event a member continues in employment subsequent to his normal service retirement date and dies prior to actual retirement. 
(c)  The election by a member of option A above shall be null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member's retirement. If a member remains in the active employ of the city beyond his normal service retirement date, his retirement, for the purpose of this paragraph, will be deemed to be at his deferred service retirement date. 
(d)  A member who has elected either of the options may, at any time within the period provided for such election, revoke any election by written notice to the personnel department. 
(Code 1958, § 19-10) 
Sec. 15-44. - Disability retirement allowance. 
(a)  Upon his disability retirement date a member may, at his option, receive a monthly disability allowance equal to the smaller of: 
(1)  One-half (1/2) of the member's monthly compensation during the month immediately preceding the date disability occurs; or 
(2)  One hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). 
(b)  Such monthly disability allowance shall be deducted from the membership service reserve credited to the member's account and shall cease upon the first of the following to occur: 
(1)  The complete depletion of the membership service reserve credited to the member's account; 
(2)  The recovery from such disability; 
(3)  The death of the member. 
(c)  Upon termination of a member's monthly disability allowance because of recovery from such disability, and provided he reenters the active employ of the city within thirty (30) days after such recovery, he shall continue to be a member of the system and shall thereafter make his required contributions to the fund. In no way, however, is this provision to be construed that the membership service reserve credited to the member's account shall be restored to the total amount credited prior to the commencement of such monthly disability allowance payments. Such membership service reserve shall, instead, be accumulated following recovery in the normal way from the amount to which it had been reduced at the termination of such monthly disability allowances. 
(d)  Should a member's monthly disability allowance be terminated because of death of the member, any death benefits provided elsewhere hereunder shall be reduced by the total amount of all monthly disability allowance payments made during the member's period of disability. 
(e)  Upon the termination of a member's monthly disability allowance because of the complete depletion of the membership service reserve credited to the member's account, the member's membership under the system shall thereupon cease and terminate and no further benefits shall be provided under the system. 
(f)  Once each year following the disability retirement of a member who is receiving a monthly disability allowance, the personnel department may require such member to undergo a medical examination conducted by the medical committee. Should the member refuse to submit to any medical examination, his monthly disability allowance shall be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal for one (1) year, all of his rights to any disability allowance payments shall cease and his membership under the system shall there upon terminate. 
(Code 1958, § 19-11) 
Sec. 15-45. - Benefits upon death or termination. 
(a)  Each member shall name a beneficiary to receive any benefits payable upon the member's death such designation to be made on a form provided by the personnel department. A member may change his designation of the beneficiary from time to time in the same manner. 
(b)  In the event a member who has elected option A under subsection 15-43(a) dies subsequent to his normal service retirement date but while still employed by the city, in lieu of any other benefit payable hereunder by reason of death, there shall be payable to his beneficiary the same monthly allowance that would otherwise have been payable under option A if the member had retired on his normal service retirement date. 
(c)  Should a member die prior to his service retirement but before completing five (5) years service in the employ of the city, there shall be paid in a lump sum to his beneficiary, not later than ninety (90) days following the death of the member, the amount of the accumulated contributions credited to the member's account at his death. Such accumulated contributions paid as a death benefit to the beneficiary shall be reduced by the total amount of all disability allowance payments, if any, paid to the member prior to his death. 
(d)  Should a member die prior to his service retirement but after completing five (5) years service in the employ of the city, there shall be paid in a lump sum to his beneficiary, not later than ninety (90) days following the death of the member, the amount of the membership service reserve credited to the member's account at his death. 
(e)  If the employment of a member is terminated before completing ten (10) years of service in the employ of the city other than by service retirement, disability retirement, or death, there shall be payable to such member in a lump sum not later than ninety (90) days following such termination the amount of his accumulated contributions as of the date of termination. Such accumulated contributions payable upon such termination of employment of a member shall be reduced by the total amount of all disability allowance payments paid to the member prior to such termination. Upon such termination of employment and the payment from the fund of the amount herein provided, the membership of such terminating employee shall cease and no further benefits shall be payable under the system. 
(f)  If the employment of a member is terminated after completing ten (10) years of service in the employ of the city, other than by service retirement, disability retirement, or death, there shall be payable to such member in a lump sum, not later than ninety (90) days following such termination, an amount in relation to his then completed years of service in accordance with the percentage of membership service reserve shown in the table below. Such benefits shall be reduced in event of any previous disability allowance payments to the member by an amount in accordance with the percentage of disability allowance payments to be deducted shown in the table set forth below for the appropriate number of completed years of service.

(g)  Upon such termination of employment and the payment from the fund of the amount herein provided, the membership of such terminating employee shall thereupon cease and no further benefits shall be payable under this system, except as provided in section 15-42. 
(h)  Should a member die at any time after service retirement but before receiving membership service allowance amounting to at least as much in total as his membership service reserve as of the date of such service retirement, the difference between such membership service reserve and such total membership service allowances shall be payable to the beneficiary under one (1) of the following options as the beneficiary may select: 
(1)  In a lump sum within ninety (90) days following the death of the member, or 
(2)  Payment in monthly amounts equal to the monthly amount received by deceased member until such difference is depleted. 
(i)  In the event a member terminates his employment with the city for any other reason than disability after twenty (20) years' service and before attaining age fifty-five (55) he may retain in the system the membership service reserve credited to his account at such time and elect to receive his membership service allowance at the normal service retirement date or early service retirement date. 
(j)  Actuarial deficits that may occur as a result of payments made from the fund under (h) above and section 15-41, shall be an obligation of the city. The city shall make up such deficits by budget appropriation in the fiscal year following such deficits. In order to establish a reserve for this deficit the city shall pay an additional one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per year into the fund until such reserve amounts to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). 
(k)  Should a member's employment with the city be terminated because of abolition of his position following transfer of services to Metropolitan Dade County government, whether such member has been accepted for employment with Metropolitan Dade County or not, provided he did not reject county employment with duties, responsibilities and level of compensation equivalent to those held with the city on his own volition, the member shall be allowed to draw his membership service reserve reduced by the total amount of all disability allowance payments. Equivalency of duties, responsibilities, and level of compensation shall be determined by the personnel department and approved by a majority vote of the pension system advisory committee. Those members who are not accepted for county employment shall obtain a certificate from the Dade County personnel department indicating that the member had sought county employment, but had been disqualified, stating the reason for disqualification. 
(l)  If as a result of transfer of services to Metropolitan Dade County government a member is required to be demoted to a lower class of position following abolition of his position in a higher class and reallocation of his position from such higher class to the lower class, the member shall be allowed to draw his membership service reserve reduced by the total amount of all disability allowance payments if he presents evidence of having obtained employment with Metropolitan Dade County in the same occupational area in which he was employed with the city. This option must be exercised at the earliest date following the demotion that Metropolitan Dade County accepts applications and examines applicants for positions in this occupational area. 
(Code 1958, § 19-12) 
Sec. 15-46. - Changes or errors in records. 
    Should any change or error in records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, then on discovery of any such error the personnel department shall correct the same and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(Code 1958, § 19-13) 
Sec. 15-47. - Effect of repeal of article. 
(a)  If this article shall later be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, the personnel department shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of the members. 
(c)  In the event of repeal of this article, the assets of the system shall be allocated by the city treasurer in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled to benefits in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(d)  The allocation of assets of the system in event of repeal of thin article shall be carried out through the payment by the city treasurer of the benefits provided hereunder as they become due or by the transfer of such assets to any retirement system replacing this system provided that full vesting of benefits under this system are provided and fully maintained under such new retirement system. Any funds remaining in the assets of this system after all the vested benefits provided hereunder have been paid shall revert to the general fund of the city. 
(e)  Any allocation of assets made in accordance with the provisions hereunder shall be final and binding on all persons entitled to benefits under the system.

Sec. 15-62. - Employees retirement system (Ord. No. 582) continued. 
(a)  It is deemed to be to the best interests of the city and the citizens, residents, inhabitants and taxpayers thereof that the city maintain a retirement system for its employees, sworn police personnel and firefighters and to that end the city employees retirement system initially established by prior ordinance (Ord. No. 582) is herewith continued as amended in its entirety by this article. 
(b)  All amendments to the system made on October 22, 1991, are adopted contingent upon and will be effective as set forth herein upon the receipt of a favorable advance determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that the system, as amended by this article for the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, rulings and regulations, satisfies the requirements of sections 401(a) and 414(h)(2) of the code, and that the fund is tax exempt pursuant to section 501(a) of the code. If for any reason a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service cannot be issued, all amendments to the system made on October 22, 1991 shall be of no force or effect. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.10; Ord. No. 858, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 914, § 1, 3-22-94) 
Sec. 15-63. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Correction of errors. Should any change or error in records result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than he would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, then on discovery of any such error the board shall cause the same to be corrected and as far as practicable shall direct that the payments be adjusted in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. 
(b)  Illegality of part no effect on whole. If any section or part of any section of this article is declared illegal, the remainder of this article shall not thereby be invalidated. All provisions of any ordinances of the city, inconsistent with the provisions of this article are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistencies. 
(c)  Amendment and termination. 
(l)  This article establishing the system and fund and amending prior ordinances pertaining to retirement benefits for city employees, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to the system and fund, may be modified, terminated or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting pursuant to this article, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be reduced thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(2)  Provided further, no recommendations to make changes in this system shall be made to the city council unless the same have been unanimously approved by the board of trustees or, in the absence of a unanimous vote of the board of trustees, recommendations to make changes to this system shall be upon a majority vote of the board of trustees and, in addition thereto, approval by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the membership of the system. 
(3)  Provided further, if this article shall be repealed, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future person entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of the members. In the event of repeal, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to the date of repeal and the assets of the system and shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled to benefits in accordance with the provisions of this article, with prior preference being directed towards the return of prior vested benefits and accumulated contributions. The allocation of assets of the system in event of repeal of this article shall be carried out through the payment of the benefits provided by this article as they become due, or by the transfer of such assets to any retirement system replacing this system, provided that the full vesting of benefits under the system are provided and fully maintained under such new retirement system. Any funds remaining in the assets of this system after all the vested benefits provided by this article have been paid shall revert to the general fund of the city. Any allocation of assets made in accordance with the provisions of this article shall be final and binding on all persons entitled to benefits under the system. 
(4)  Limitation of benefits on early termination. If the system is terminated for any reason other than the failure to obtain Internal Revenue Service approval then notwithstanding any provision in this article to the contrary, during the first ten (10) years after the effective date of this article, and if full current costs had not been made at the end of the first ten (10) years, until such full current costs are met, the benefits provided by the city's contributions for the members whose anticipated annual benefit at normal retirement date exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) and who at the effective date of the system were among the twenty-five (25) highest paid employees of the city will be subject to the conditions set forth in the following provisions: 
a.  The benefit payable to a member described in this section or his beneficiary shall not exceed the greater of those benefits purchasable by the greater of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or an amount equal to twenty (20) percent of the first fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) of the member's annual compensation multiplied by the number of years from the effective date of this agreement to the earlier of: 
1.  The date of termination of the system; or 
2.  The date the benefit of the member becomes payable; or 
3.  The date of a failure on the part of the city to meet the full current costs of the system; 
or the present value of the maximum benefit provided in section 4022(b)(3B) of the act. 
b.  If the system is terminated or the full current costs thereof have not been met at any time within ten (10) years after the effective date, the benefits which any of the members described in this section may receive from the city's contribution shall not exceed the benefits set forth in subsection (c)(4)a of this section. If at the end of the first ten (10) years the full current costs are not met, the restrictions will continue to apply until the full current costs are funded for the first time. If a member described in this section leaves the employ of the city or withdraws from membership in the system when the full current costs have been met, the benefits which may be received from the city contributions shall not at any time within the first ten (10) years after the effective date exceed the benefits set forth above except as provided in the case of a lump sum distribution described below. These conditions shall not restrict the full payment of any survivor's benefits on behalf of a member who dies while in the system and the conditions shall not restrict the current payment of full retirement allowance called for by the system for any retired member while the system is in full effect and its full current costs have been met, provided an agreement, adequately secured, guarantees the repayment of any part of the distribution that is or may become restricted. 
c.  If the benefits of, or with respect to, any member shall have been suspended or limited in accordance with the limitations of the above sections because the full current costs of the system shall not then have been met, and if such full current costs shall thereafter be met, then the full amount of the benefits payable to such member shall be resumed and the parts of such benefits which have been suspended shall then be paid in full. 
d.  If on the termination of the system within the first ten (10) years after the effective date, the funds under the system are more than sufficient to provide the full retirement allowance for members and their beneficiaries including full benefits for all members other than such of the twenty-five (25) highest paid employees as are still in the service of the city and also including retirement allowance as limited by this section for such twenty-five (25) highest paid employees, then any excess of such funds shall be used to provide retirement allowance for the twenty-five (25) highest paid employees in excess of such limitations of this section up to the benefits to which such employees would be entitled without such limitations. 
e.  If congress should provide by statute, or the treasury department or the Internal Revenue Service should provide by regulation or ruling, that the limitations provided for in this section are no longer necessary in order to meet the requirements for a governmental plan under the code as then in effect, the limitations in this section shall become void and shall no longer apply without the necessity of amendment to the system. 
f.  If a lump sum distribution is made to an employee subject to the above restrictions in an amount in excess of that amount otherwise permitted under this section, an agreement shall be made, with adequate security guaranteeing repayment of any amount of the distribution that is restricted. Adequate security shall mean property having a fair market value of at least one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the amount which would be repayable if the system had terminated on the date of distribution of such lump sum. If the fair market value of the property falls below one hundred ten (110) percent of the amount which would then be repayable if the system were then to terminate, the distribution shall deposit additional property to bring the value of the property to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of such amount. 
(d)  Takeover of city function by outside instrumentality. If any city function, agency or department or activity thereof is taken over in whole or in part by another city, county, governmental entity or instrumentality thereof, and such takeover or acquisition presents or poses any problem, threat or action adversely affecting the accrued benefits of a member under this system, such takeover or acquisition shall be deemed to be a termination as respects any member so affected and the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply unless a member voluntarily relinquishes and waives such rights and consents in writing to an alternative course of action. 
(e)  Attachment or garnishment of benefits. No benefit whatsoever as provided in this article shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or to any other legal process; provided, however, that subsequent to termination of employment, and prior to refund, a member may voluntarily assign such funds or a portion thereof to the city or any of its recognized agencies for the satisfaction of lawfully contracted obligations. 
(f)  No liability for sufficiency of fund. The trustee shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for in this article and shall be under no duty or obligation to inquire into the sufficiency of the payments made into the fund by the city. 
(g)  Resignation of trustee. A trustee may resign that trust at any time by giving sixty (60) days' written notice to the city. A trustee may be removed only for cause stated or for failure to attend meetings as stated in this article and by affirmative action of six (6) trustees. In the event of vacancy occurring at any time, a qualified successor trustee shall be chosen in the same manner as the prior trustee. 
(h)  Right to remain under prior system. All employees of the city as of the effective date of this system shall have the right for a period of ninety (90) days following the effective date to elect to remain under the city's retirement system as it existed immediately prior to the effective date of this article. Such election shall be irrevocable and employees who elect to remain under the prior system shall be governed exclusively by the provisions thereof and shall have no rights whatsoever as regards this system. Uniform procedures to be followed concerning election of coverage as between the respective systems shall be established by the city. 
(i)  Transfers into system. With the approval of the city manager, new employees of the city who have acquired assets to their credit under a pension plan or system in previous employment, and such assets are transferable to the city's system, shall have the right to have such assets transferred to the system and receive such benefits therefrom as may be financed by the assets so transferred, plus such additional benefits as may accrue by reason of being a regular member of this system. 
(j)  Editorial usage. Wherever the masculine is used in this article, it shall also refer to the feminine. The paragraph and section headings used in this article are for convenience only and shall not be interpreted apart from the accompanying text. 
(k)  Exclusive benefit. No pension provided hereunder shall be assignable and no part of the corpus or income of the fund shall be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries and until those liabilities are satisfied, all city contributions will remain in the fund for the benefit of the members or beneficiaries in the event the plan is terminated or city contributions cease. 
(l)  Vesting. Upon the termination of the plan or on the complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan, each member shall have non-forfeitable, one hundred (100) percent vested rights to benefits accrued to date of the termination or discontinuance to the extent funded at that time.

However, in no event shall a member's annual retirement benefit be less than the member's accrued benefit earned as of November 10, 2015, determined in accordance with the provisions of the plan in effect as of November 9, 2015. Upon retirement from the system, members who elect to continue participating in the system may elect to receive their accrued benefit as of November 10, 2015, or their benefit calculated on the date of retirement in accordance with the plan provisions in effect on that date. For those members who have reached the normal retirement date as of November 10, 2015 and elect to remain in the system, benefits and contributions shall be based on the provisions of the system in effect on November 9, 2015. 
(d)  Members hired prior to the date the city joins FRS who elect to join FRS will have the option of retaining their accrued benefit in the system, or receiving a refund of their accumulated contributions. Such member's accrued benefit shall be calculated based on the member's average final compensation and the system provisions in effect on the date the city joins FRS, and credited service through the day before the date the member joins FRS. Members who elect to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions may purchase prior service in the FRS at the member's expense, in accordance with applicable Florida statutes and rules. 
(e)  Regardless of whether a member elects to join FRS or continues participating in the system, in order to receive any benefit from this system (other than disability or death benefits) a member must reach the early or normal retirement date and terminate employment with the city.

(Code 1958, § 19-14.14; Ord. No. 858, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 895, §§ 1, 2, 2-23-93; Ord. No. 914, § 1, 3-22-94; Ord. No. 934, § 1, 6-13-95; Ord. No. 1397, § 7, 3-8-16; Ord. No. 1415, § 2, 6-27-17) 
Sec. 15-91. - Maximum annual benefit. 
(a)  (1)  Subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to a member under the system in any limitation year shall equal the lesser of: Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) or one hundred (100) percent of the member's section 415 compensation averaged over the three (3) consecutive limitation years (or actual number of limitation years for members who have been employed by the city for less than three (3) consecutive limitation years) during which the member had the greatest section 415 compensation. For purposes of applying the limitations, the limitation year shall be the fiscal year of the system. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the maximum annual benefit for any participant in a defined benefit plan in existence on July 1, 1982, shall not be less than the protected current accrued benefit, payable annually, provided for under question T-3 of Internal Revenue Service Notice 83-10. 
(2)  For plan years beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to a member under the system in any limitation year shall not exceed ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00). For purposes of applying the limitation, the limitation year shall be the fiscal year of the system. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the maximum annual benefit for any participant in a defined benefit plan in existence on July 1, 1982, shall not be less than the protected current accrued benefit, payable annually, provided for under question T-3 of Internal Revenue Service Notice 83-10. 
(3)  For limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to a member under the system in any limitation year shall not exceed one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00). 
(b)  The limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) shall be adjusted annually as provided in section 415(d) of the code pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury (the section 415(b) dollar limitation). The adjusted limitation is effective as of January first of each calendar year and is applicable to limitation years ending with or within that calendar year. The percentage limitation stated above for members who have separated from service with a non-forfeitable right to an accrued benefit shall be adjusted annually as provided in section 415(d) of the code pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury. 
(c)  Adjustments to annual benefit and limitations. 
    If the annual benefit begins after age sixty-five (65) years, the section 415(b) dollar limitation shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the limitation of the section 415(b) dollar limitation at age sixty-five (65) years. For purposes of adjusting the annual benefit to a straight life annuity, the interest rate assumption shall satisfy section 415(b)(2)(E), as specified by the board of trustees with the advice of the pension system actuary. 
    If the annual benefit begins prior to age sixty-two (62), the section 415(b) dollar limitation applicable to the participant at the earlier age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the earlier age that is actuarially equivalent to the section 415(b) dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age sixty-two (62), calculated using assumptions that satisfy section 415(b)(2)(E). 
    For purposes of adjusting the section 415(b) dollar limitation applicable prior to age sixty-five (65) years, the interest rate assumption shall be the greater of five (5) percent or the rate specified by the board of trustees with the advice of the pension system actuary and the mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death. For purposes of adjusting the section 415(b) dollar limitation applicable after age sixty-five (65) years, the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of five (5) percent or the rate specified (see above) and the mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death. For purposes of this section no adjustments under section 415(d) shall be taken into account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first takes effect. 
    For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the following shall apply: 
(1)  In the event the annual benefit begins before age sixty-two (62), the benefit will be limited to: 
a.  If the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the section 415(b) dollar limitation), with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for determining actuarial equivalence for early retirement purposes; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table. 
b.  if the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the lesser of (1) section 415(b) dollar limitation; and (2) the product of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted under section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of section 415. The applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, as may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  If the annual benefit begins after age sixty-five (65), the section 415 dollar limitation is increased to: 
a.  if the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for determining actuarial equivalence for delayed retirement purposes; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table. 
b.  if the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the lesser of (1) the adjusted dollar limitation determined in accordance with (ii); and (2) the product of the section 415(b) dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A)(as adjusted under section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of section 415. 
The applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, as may be amended from time to time. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits of section 415, a benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is not subject to section 417(e)(3) shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals: 
a.  for limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable under the plan at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using an interest rate of five (5) percent and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3). 
b.  for limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (1) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; and (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table. 
    The applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, as may be amended from time to time. 
(d)  The employer hereby elects pursuant to the provisions of section 415(b)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to have the special limitations applicable to state and local government plans applicable. The limitations imposed by section 415 of the Code as related to this plan shall be calculated in accordance with the special rules set forth in section 415(b)(10). 
(e)  Reduction for services less than ten (10) years. Subject to the requirements of section 415 of the Code, if a member had less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city at the time he begins to receive benefits, the limitations of this section shall be reduced by multiplying such limitations by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service, or part thereof, and the denominator of which is ten (10). For plan years beginning on or after December 31, 1996, subject to the requirements of section 415 of the Code, income received from this plan as the result of the member's becoming disabled by reason of personal injury or sickness and income received by the beneficiaries and survivors or estate of a member as the result of the death of the member shall not be subject to reduction pursuant to this section 15-91(e). 
(f)  For plan years beginning on or after December 31, 1996, in the case of a policeman or firefighter who is a "qualified participant" as defined herein below, the limitations contained in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section 15-91 shall not be applicable. The maximum benefit provided hereunder to "qualified participants" shall be an annual benefit in the form of a straight life annuity not greater than one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) as adjusted from time to time pursuant to Code section 415(d). A "qualified participant" is a member of this plan whose period of service taken into account for benefit purposes includes at least fifteen (15) years of service as defined herein. Years of service shall include all service credited under the plan as a full time employee of any police department or fire department operated by the political subdivision maintaining this plan for any area within the jurisdiction of this political subdivision and all service credited under the plan for service as a member of the armed forces of the United States. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan, the benefit of a member shall be reduced to the extent that it exceeds amounts specified in section 415 of the Code. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.14; Ord. No. 858, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 982, § 1, 10-28-97; Ord. No. 1306, § 6, 10-26-10) 
Sec. 15-92. - Disability benefits. 
(a)  Service incurred disability benefit. There shall be paid any member entitled to a service incurred disability pension a monthly benefit of seventy-five (75) percent of compensation, for life or until recovery from disability, such benefit to be reduced by an offset as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Nonservice-incurred disability benefit. There shall be paid any member entitled to nonservice incurred disability pension a monthly benefit equal to two and one-half (21/2) percent of average final compensation times all years of credited service prior to July 1, 1969, and three (3) percent of average final compensation times all years of credited service after July 1, 1969. However, for any year prior to October 1, 1968, during which a member has contributed less than seven (7) percent of compensation, the benefit percentage for each year of service shall be as follows: 
    Any benefit payable as developed by the above formula, or by a combination of the above formulae, shall be subject in any event to a maximum of fifty (50) percent of compensation, such benefit to be reduced by any benefits received from social security; however, any member entitled to an early or normal service retirement benefit as of time of disability or entitlement to a disability benefit may elect to take an early or normal retirement benefit in lieu and instead of the disability benefit. 
Contribution

(c)  Maximum benefit from all sources and benefit offset. The maximum disability benefit payable from all sources (benefits from system, worker's compensation, social security, benefits under the provisions of Ordinance No. 582 included in this chapter as article II) shall not in any event exceed a member's regular rate of compensation in city employment immediately preceding disability; therefore, benefits payable from the system shall accordingly be reduced so that the total benefit received from all sources as above set forth shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of the disabled member's regular rate of compensation in city employment immediately preceding disability. 
(d)  Disability. "Disability" shall mean a physical or mental condition resulting from a bodily injury, disease, illness or mental disorder which renders a member incapable of performing work for the city which would provide compensation to such member at the following rates of the member's regular rate of compensation in his city employment immediately preceding disability: 
(1)  Service incurred disability. A rate not less than ninety (90) percent of the member's regular rate of compensation. 
(2)  Nonservice incurred disability. A rate not less than seventy-five (75) percent of the member's regular rate of compensation. 
(e)  Determination of disability; board decision; medical examination. In order for a member to be entitled to any type of disability benefit he shall apply in writing to the board of trustees, whereupon the board shall arrange with the medical director for physical examination of such applicant by the medical committee. The findings of the medical committee concerning the disabled status of such applicant and the question as to whether or not the disability is service-connected shall be final. Any person receiving a disability benefit pursuant to this article shall be subject to reexamination annually, in the sole discretion of the board of trustees, for the purpose of determining the then existing status of the disability of such pensioner. If found to be able to perform active duty, such retiree shall be reinstated in employment and shall receive full credit for credited service during the period of disability. In determining the nature and extent of any disability the board and the medical committee, following uniform rules of procedure, may if deemed necessary cause an applicant to be examined by other physicians designated by the board. Should any applicant or retiree refuse to submit to examination as specified by this section, his eligibility for and rights to a disability benefit shall cease. 
(f)  Optional methods of disability retirement payments. In lieu of the benefits otherwise provided, any police officer or firefighter member awarded a disability retirement pursuant to this section may elect to have his disability retirement benefit payable under either of the options set forth in subsections 15-95(1) or 15-95(2). The value of optional disability retirement benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable. 
Editor's note- The provisions of subsection (f) shall be effective Dec. 31, 1999.

(a)  Death before retirement. 
(1)  Service connected. Upon the death of a member where the cause of death is the direct result of an act or occurrence arising from employment there shall be paid to such deceased member's surviving spouse, till death or, as to general employees, remarriage, or for or on behalf of any child under age nineteen (19) years, a monthly benefit equal to fifty (50) percent of such deceased member's monthly compensation at the time of death, plus ten (10) percent of such member's monthly compensation to each child under age nineteen (19) years. Except as provided elsewhere in this section the total maximum death benefit shall be one hundred (100) percent of compensation, or fifty (50) percent if there is no surviving spouse. If survivors receive benefits from social security or workers' compensation the amount of compensation from this pension plan shall be reduced by an amount so that all funds collected from workers' compensations and social security and the pension plan shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of the employee's salary at the time of death. Benefits payable from any veterans benefits or pension under state or federal law will not require an offset from this pension plan. If the deceased member had previously selected an option, such option shall apply to the exclusion of other provisions herein. Death benefits paid to a surviving spouse of a sworn police officer or fire fighter shall not be effected by remarriage, provided the city continues to receive state excise tax monies as provided in F.S. §§ 185.08 and 175.101. 
(2)  Nonservice-connected. 
a.  Upon the nonservice-connected death of a member not entitled to an early or normal retirement benefit there shall be paid to such deceased member's beneficiaries an amount equal to such member's prior vested benefit plus his accumulated contributions. 
b.  Upon the nonservice-connected death of a member entitled to an early or normal retirement benefit, without such member having previously selected an option under which survivorship benefits are payable, it shall be assumed that such member had elected Option B2 (life and ten (10) years certain basis) and retired immediately preceding his death. If the deceased member had previously selected an option, such option shall apply to the exclusion of other provisions in this section. 
(b)  Death after retirement. Any benefit payable by reason of the death of a retiree shall be pursuant to the option selected prior to retirement. If no option has been selected, the death benefit payable shall be the difference between the retired member's prior vested benefit plus his accumulated contributions as of his retirement date and the total monthly retirement benefits paid prior to his date of death. 
(c)  Death during qualified military service. In the case of a death or disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the participant had resumed and then terminated employment by the city on account of death.

(1)  His prior vested benefit, or prior accumulated contributions; 
(2)  His accumulated contributions, if any; 
provided further, if a member at time of termination is entitled to a normal, early, delayed or disability retirement benefit such benefit shall be payable under the provisions of this section in lieu and instead of the minimum benefit otherwise payable, and including optional forms of payment applicable to the regular retirement benefits provided for in this article. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.17; Ord. No. 858, § 1, 10-22-91) 
Sec. 15-95. - Optional methods of retirement payments. 
    Each member shall have the right at any time up to one (1) month prior to the actual retirement date to elect to have the retirement benefit payable under any of the options set forth in this section in lieu of the benefits otherwise provided, and to revoke any such elections and make a new election at any time one (1) month prior to the actual retirement date. The value of optional retirement benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable. The member shall make such an election by written request to the board. 
(1)  Joint and last survivor option. A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement benefit during the member's lifetime and have such decreased retirement benefit or designated fraction thereof continued after death to and during the lifetime of another person, designated a "joint pensioner." The retiree will have the power to change such designation from time to time but any change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the pension board. The amount of retirement income payable shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the ages and sex of the previous joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the employee. The previous joint pensioner must be alive at the time the retiree elects to make a change. 
(2)  Five (5) or ten (10) years certain basis. A member may elect to take a reduced benefit on a basis providing that such benefit shall be payable for a period of life and five (5) years or ten (10) years certain in any event. 
(3)  Social security option. A member retiring under either early or normal retirement provisions and not for disability may elect to receive an increased benefit from the system until such time as social security benefits commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance throughout the period of his retirement. 
(4)  Lump-sum option. A member may elect to receive a single lump sum payment of the entire retirement benefit payable hereunder. If this option is chosen, the member shall be entitled to receive a refund of prior contributions (to the extent that such prior contributions do not exceed the member's accumulated leave benefit) in addition to his retirement benefit hereunder. The board shall require each electing member to (i) release and discharge any and all claims the member may have against the system, the board, and the city as a condition to receiving the lump sum benefit provided hereunder, and (ii) consent to and acknowledge the benefits to which the member is entitled hereunder as well as the member's other benefits provided by the city upon retirement (which shall include, but shall not be limited to, the member's accumulated leave benefit). The calculation of the lump sum value of the member's retirement benefit shall be determined on an actuarially equivalent basis and shall be the actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement benefit (without reduction for the refund of the member's prior contribution as set forth above). This option shall be calculated without reference to any cost-of-living adjustment. This option shall not be available to an employee who first becomes a member on or after October 1, 2004. 
(5)  Partial lump sum/annuity option. A member may elect to receive a portion of any benefit in the form of a lump sum and a portion of any benefit in the form of an annuity option provided for in the plan. The value of the lump sum and annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the value of the benefits to which the member is otherwise entitled. The actuary for the system shall calculate the amount of a member's lump sum benefit and the amount of the annuity benefit in accordance with the actuarial assumptions set forth in the system. The lump sum portion of the benefit shall be calculated without reference to any cost-of-living adjustment.

Sec. 15-95.1. - Cost-of-living adjustment of benefits. 
(1)  The purpose of this option is to provide compounding cost-of-living adjustments, hereinafter referred to as COLA, to the monthly benefits payable to retired members of the plan who retire on and after October 1, 2004 and their beneficiaries. COLA benefits shall only be available in cases where the retired member has selected any form of benefit other than the Lump-sum option as provided in subsection 15-95(4). COLA benefits shall not be available to any member receiving a service connected disability or non-service connected disability. 
(2)  As used herein, "benefit" means the monthly benefit payable to a retiree or beneficiary at the time of an adjustment date, as hereinafter set forth. 
(3)  Effective on and after October 1, 2004 and for members who have reached their normal retirement date on or before November 10, 2015, such a member who, prior to retirement, selects any form of benefit other than the lump-sum option as provided in subsection 15-95(4), shall be entitled to make an election, which shall be irrevocable, as follows: 
(a)  The annuity portion of the benefit of each member shall be adjusted on April 1st, 2005, and on every April 1st thereafter, and shall be subject to pro-ration based on the number of months that the member has been retired during the twelve (12) months preceding each April 1st, as follows: 
(1)  The amount of the monthly benefit payable for the 12-month period commencing on the date coincident with the date on which the retired member has been retired for one (1) year, shall be the amount of the member's benefit the preceding month, plus an amount equal to a 1.92 percent of the member's benefit; or 
(2)  The amount of the monthly benefit payable for the 12-month period commencing on the date coincident with the date on which the retired member has been retired for three (3) years, shall be the amount of the member's benefit the preceding month, plus an amount equal to a two and five-tenths (2.5) percent of the member's benefit; or

(b)  In case of a beneficiary becoming entitled to COLA benefits hereunder, the date of the retired member's retirement shall govern. 
(4)  Effective on and after November 10, 2015, a member who has not reached the normal retirement date as of that date and selects any form of benefit other than the lump-sum option as provided in subsection 15-95(4), shall be entitled to the following: 
(a)  The annuity portion of the benefit of each member shall be adjusted on April 1st of each year on which the member is so eligible as set forth below, and shall be subject to pro-ration based on the number of months that the member has been retired during the twelve (12) months preceding each April 1st, as follows:

Sec. 15-98. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under subsection 15-94(1) or (2) and subsection 15-95(4), (6) or (7), a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
(2)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective as of January 1, 2008, an employee's or former employee's non-spouse beneficiary is a distributee with regard to the interest of the employee or former employee. 
(4)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non-direct) rollover. 
(Ord. No. 929, § 1, 1-10-95; Ord. No. 1306, § 8, 10-26-10; Ord. No. 1384, § 2, 4-28-15) 
Sec. 15-99. - Exclusive benefit. 
    No pension provided hereunder shall be assignable or subject part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members and their beneficiaries and until those liabilities are satisfied, all city contributions will remain in the fund for the benefit of the members or beneficiaries in the event the plan is terminated or city contributions cease. 
    Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce current or future contributions to the fund. 
    Upon the termination of the plan or on the complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan, each member shall have non-forfeitable, one hundred (100) percent vested rights to benefits accrued to date of the termination or discontinuance to the extent funded at that time. 
(Ord. No. 1306, § 9, 10-26-10) 
Sec. 15-100. - Retirement incentive program. 
(a)  Creation. There is hereby created a retirement incentive program to provide an inducement for certain eligible members of the system to terminate their employment with the city and begin retirement within a proscribed window, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. 
(b)  Eligibility requirements. In order to qualify for the retirement incentive program, a member must meet each of the following eligibility requirements on or before January 1, 2014: 
(1)  Rule of 60. The member's age and years of credited service with the city must total at least sixty (60). 
(2)  The member must meet the eligibility requirements for normal or early retirement set forth in section 15-89, "Retirement dates" of the City Code. 
(3)  The member must have at least ten (10) years of credited service with the city. For purposes of determining a member's eligibility under this subsection (b)(3) only, credited service shall include: (i) the number of years a member has been actively employed by the city and (ii) any military service credit pursuant to section 15-85.1 of the City Code resulting from the member's voluntary or involuntary service in the uniformed services occurring subsequent to and during the member's employment with the city. All other service, which would otherwise be considered credited service under the system, shall not be utilized to determine whether a member meets the eligibility requirements to participate in the retirement incentive program. 
(4)  By no later than November 15, 2013, the member must submit to the city, on a form(s) promulgated by the city: (i) a notice of election to participate in the retirement incentive program; (ii) an irrevocable resignation of employment setting forth the member's voluntarily elected last day of employment on or before January 1, 2014; and (iii) a waiver and release of all claims against the city that arose prior to the member's retirement date. The member shall continue to accrue service credit through the member's last day of employment. 
    If a member does not meet each of the above-specified eligibility requirements, the member is not eligible to participate in the retirement incentive program. 
(c)  Retirement incentive program benefit. 
(1)  Benefit amount. Members who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subsection (b) above shall receive an immediately payable monthly retirement benefit (a member eligible for early retirement must receive an immediate monthly benefit pursuant to subsection 15-90(3)(b) and not a deferred monthly benefit as set forth in subsection 15-90(3)(a)) calculated as follows: 
a.  Four (4) percent of the member's average final compensation for up to twenty (20) years of credited service which meets the definition of credited service set forth in subsection (b)(3) above to determine a member's eligibility to participate in the retirement incentive program. 
b.  Three (3) percent of the member's average final compensation for all other years of credited service earned under the system. 
c.  If a member does not meet the eligibility requirements for normal retirement set forth in section 15-89, "Retirement dates" of the City Code, then the amount of the member's benefit shall be reduced by 0.33 percent for each month by which the member's early retirement date precedes the member's normal retirement date. 
d.  Sworn police personnel shall be entitled to receive any benefits attributable to funds received from the state for the exclusive use of sworn police personnel under any other city retirement plan. 
(2)  Form of benefit. The normal form of benefit for the retirement incentive program shall be a monthly benefit payable during the lifetime of the member unless the member elects one of the following optional forms below: 
a.  Joint and last survivor option. A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement benefit during the member's lifetime and have such decreased retirement benefit or a designated fraction thereof continued after death to and during the lifetime of another person, designated a "joint pensioner." The retiree will have the power to change such designation from time to time but any change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the pension board. The amount of retirement income payable shall be actuarially re-determined taking into account the ages and sex of the previous joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the employee. The previous joint pensioner must be alive at the time the retiree elects to make a change. 
b.  Five (5) or ten (10) years certain basis. A member may elect to take a reduced benefit on a basis providing that such benefit shall be payable for a period of life and five (5) years or ten (10) years certain in any event. 
c.  Social security option. A member may elect to receive an increased benefit until such time as social security benefits commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance throughout the period of the member's retirement. 
(3)  Other retirement incentive program benefits. 
a.  Lump sum payment. Members who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subsection (b) above and who elect to participate in the retirement incentive program shall receive a lump sum payment from the city equal to one (1) week of his/her base salary, up to a maximum of six (6) weeks, for every full week that he or she retires prior to January 1, 2014. In other words, if a member retire on January 1, 2014, he or she is not entitled to a lump sum payment, however, if he or she retires on December 3, 2013, he or she is entitled to four (4) weeks of the lump sum payment. Such lump sum payment shall not be part of compensation for purposes of calculating a member's retirement benefit. 
b.  Health insurance premiums. For members who are under the age of sixty-five (65), meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subsection (b) above and elect to participate in the retirement incentive program, the city shall pay the full cost of the member's health insurance premium through September 30, 2014, provided the member participates in the city sponsored health insurance plan. The city also shall contribute one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per month towards the cost of dependent health insurance coverage if the member elects coverage for his or her spouse/partner or his or her child(ren) and two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month if the member elects family coverage (spouse/partner and child(ren)), provided that the member's dependents participate in the city sponsored health insurance plan. The city shall pay the aforementioned premiums through September 30, 2014 or until the member reaches age sixty-five (65) or until the member is covered by Medicare, whichever of the three comes first. 
c.  The benefits set forth in subsections (c)(3)a. and b. above shall be funded and paid for by the city, and not the board or the retirement system's trust fund, and the city, not the board, will be responsible for administering these benefits. 
(4)  Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code. The retirement incentive program is meant to comply with all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and the city and the board of trustees will take no action that would jeopardize the tax qualification of the system including the right to accelerate payments to comply with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the right to defer payments to comply with Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.

c.  If the benefits of or with respect to any member shall have been suspended or limited in accordance with the limitations of the above sections because the full current costs of the system shall not then have been met, and if such full current costs shall thereafter be met, then the full amount of the benefits payable to such member shall be resumed and the parts of such benefits which have been suspended shall then be paid in full. 
d.  If on the termination of the system within the first ten (10) years after the effective date, the funds under the system are more than sufficient to provide the full retirement allowance for members and their beneficiaries including full benefits for all members other than such of the twenty-five (25) highest paid employees as are still in the service of the city and also including retirement allowance as limited by this section for such twenty-five (25) highest paid employees, then any excess of such funds shall be used to provide retirement allowance for the twenty-five (25) highest paid employees in excess of such limitations of this section up to the benefits to which such employees would be entitled without such limitations. 
e.  If congress should provide by statute, or the treasury department or the Internal Revenue Service should provide by regulation or ruling, that the limitations provided for in this section are no longer necessary in order to meet the requirements for a governmental plan under the Code as then in effect, the limitations in this section shall become void and shall no longer apply without the necessity of amendment to the system. 
f.  If a lump sum distribution is made to an employee subject to the above restrictions in an amount in excess of that amount otherwise permitted under this section, an agreement shall be made, with adequate security guaranteeing repayment of any amount of the distribution that is restricted. Adequate security shall mean property having a fair market value of at least one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the amount which would be repayable if the system had terminated on the date of distribution of such lump sum. If the fair market value of the property falls below one hundred ten (110) percent of the amount which would then be repayable if the system were then to terminate, the distributee shall deposit additional property to bring the value of the property to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of such amount. 
(d)  Takeover of city function by outside instrumentality. If any city function, agency or department or activity thereof is taken over in whole or in part by another city, county, governmental entity or instrumentality thereof, and such takeover or acquisition presents or poses any problem, threat or action adversely affecting the accrued benefits of a member under this system, such takeover or acquisition shall be deemed to be a termination as respects any member so affected and the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall apply unless a member voluntarily relinquishes and waives such rights and consents in writing to an alternative course of action. 
(e)  Attachment or garnishment of benefits. No benefit whatsoever as provided by this article shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution or to any other legal process; provided, however, that subsequent to termination of employment and prior to refund, a member may voluntarily assign such funds or a portion thereof to the city or any of its recognized agencies, for the satisfaction of lawfully contracted obligations. 
(f)  No liability for sufficiency of fund. The trustee shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for by this article and shall be under no duty or obligation to inquire into the sufficiency of the payments made into the fund by the city. 
(g)  Resignation of trustee. A trustee may resign that trust at any time by giving sixty (60) days' written notice to the city. A trustee may be removed only for cause stated or for failure to attend meetings as previously stated in this article and by affirmative action of four (4) trustees. In the event of vacancy occurring at any time, a qualified successor trustee shall be chosen in the same manner as applied to the prior trustee. 
(h)  Transfers into system. With the approval of the city manager new sworn police personnel employees of the city who have acquired assets to their credit under a pension plan or system in previous employment, such assets being transferable to the city's system, shall have the right to have such assets transferred to this system and receive such benefits therefrom as may be financed by the assets so transferred, plus such additional benefits as may accrue by reason of being a regular member of this system.

(c)  All certified law enforcement officers who are employed by the city on the date the city joins FRS will have the option to remain in the city's retirement system or participate in the FRS, special risk class. For those members who have not reached their normal retirement date as of the date the city joins the FRS and who elect to remain in the city's retirement system, the benefit levels, employee contributions and other retirement system provisions in effect on the date the city joins the FRS will remain in effect. 
(d)  Members hired prior to the date the city joins FRS who elect to join FRS will have the option of retaining their accrued benefit in the city's retirement system (based on average final compensation, credited service and the benefits in effect on the day before the date the city joins FRS), or receiving a refund of their accumulated contributions. Members who elect to receive a refund of their accumulated contributions may purchase prior service in the FRS at the member's expense, in accordance with applicable Florida statutes and rules. 
(e)  Regardless of whether a member elects to join FRS or continues participating in the city's retirement system, in order to receive any benefit from the city's retirement system (other than disability or death benefits) a member must reach the early or normal retirement date and terminate employment with the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1361, § 2, adopted November 12, 2013, redesignated the former section 15-129.2 as section 15-129.1. The historical notation has been preserved for reference purposes. 
Sec. 15-130. - Maximum annual benefit. 
(a)  Subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to a member under the system in any limitation year shall equal the lesser of: Seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) or one hundred (100) percent of the member's section 415 compensation averaged over the three (3) consecutive limitation years (or actual number of limitation years for members who have been employed by the city for less than three (3) consecutive limitation years) during which the member had the greatest section 415 compensation. For purposes of applying the limitations, the limitation year shall be the fiscal year of the system. Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the maximum annual benefit for any participant in a defined benefit plan in existence on July 1, 1982, shall not be less than the protected current accrued benefit, payable annually, provided for under question T-3 of Internal Revenue Service Notice 83-10. For limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, subject to the exceptions below, the maximum annual benefit payable to a member under the system in any limitation year shall not exceed one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00). 
(b)  The limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) shall be adjusted annually as provided in sections 415(d) and 415(b)(2)(F) of the Code pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury (the "section 415(b) dollar limitation"). The adjusted limitation is effective as of January first of each calendar year and is applicable to limitation years ending with or within that calendar year. The percentage limitation stated above for members who have separated from service with a nonforfeited right to an accrued benefit shall be adjusted annually as provided in section 415(d) of the Code pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
(c)  Adjustments to annual benefit and limitations. If the annual benefit begins before age fifty-five (55) years, the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) shall be reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) beginning at age fifty-five (55) years. 
    If the annual benefit begins after age sixty-five (65) years, the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) shall be increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) at age sixty-five (65) years. For purposes of adjusting the annual benefit to a straight life annuity, the interest rate assumption shall be the greater of five (5) percent or the rate specified by the board of trustees with the advice of the pension system actuary. 
    For purposes of adjusting the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) applicable prior to age sixty-five (65) years or the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) applicable prior to the age fifty-five (55) years, the interest rate assumption shall be the greater of five (5) percent or the rate specified by the board of trustees with the advice of the pension system actuary and the mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death. For purposes of adjusting the limitation of one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00) applicable after age sixty-five (65) years, the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of five (5) percent or the rate specified (see above) and the mortality decrement shall be ignored to the extent that a forfeiture does not occur at death. For purposes of this section no adjustments under code section 415(d) shall be taken into account before the limitation year for which such adjustment first takes effect. 
    For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the following shall apply: 
(1)  If the annual benefit begins after age sixty-five (65), the section 415(b) dollar limitation is increased to: 
a.  If the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for determining actuarial equivalence for delayed retirement purposes; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table. 
b.  If the annual benefit begins in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the lesser of (1) the adjusted dollar limitation determined in accordance with (ii); and (2) the product of the Section 415(b) dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A)(as adjusted under section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of section 415. 
The applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, as may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  For purposes of applying the limits of section 415, a benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is not subject to section 417(e)(3) shall be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals: 
a.  for limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable under the plan at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using an interest rate of five (5) percent and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3). 
b.  for limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (1) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for adjusting benefits in the same form; and (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table. 
    The applicable mortality table is the mortality table described in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, as may be amended from time to time.

(a)  Generally. A member shall be deemed disabled when there is incurred by the member a mental or physical condition resulting from injury or disease or mental disorder which renders the member incapable of performing work for the city in a manner which is satisfactory to the city and which work is not injurious to the member's health. The determination of whether or not a member is disabled within the meaning of this subsection shall be determined by the board of trustees, in its sole discretion, after receiving findings and recommendations from the medical committee. Any member applying for disability compensation must apply in writing to the board of trustees and such member must agree to submit to medical examinations as the board, following uniform rules of procedure, shall require. Any member receiving a disability benefit pursuant to this section shall be subject to periodic reexamination at such times as are necessary in the sole discretion of the board of trustees. If any member shall subsequently be determined as able to perform satisfactory work for the city without injury to that member's health, such member shall be reinstated to active employment and shall receive full credit for credited service during the period of disability towards future retirement benefits. Any member who refuses to submit to examination as specified in this section shall relinquish all right to disability compensation. 
(b)  Service-connected disability. 
(1)  There shall be paid any member entitled to a service-connected disability pension a monthly benefit of seventy-five (75) percent of compensation, for life or until recovery from disability, and such benefit shall be reduced by an offset as provided in this section. In no event shall the service-connected disability benefit be less than the member's accrued pension, or forty-two (42) percent of final average final compensation, whichever is greater. 
(2)  The maximum disability benefit payable from all sources (benefits from system, workers' compensation, social security, or any other benefits) provided by the city shall not in any event exceed a member's regular rate of compensation in city employment immediately preceding disability; therefore, service-connected disability pension benefits payable from the system shall accordingly be reduced so that the total benefit received from all sources shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of the disabled member's regular rate of compensation in city employment immediately preceding did ability. Service connected disability benefit payment may be approved for payment by the board subject to request of and following negotiations by the city manager or his designee, with the disabled employee. 
(3)  A service-connected disability is a disability incurred by an employee while directly or indirectly performing services for the city. 
(c)  Nonservice-connected disability. If a member receives a non-service connected disability, that member shall receive either in a lump sum or in a deferred retirement benefit as determined by the board of trustees the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit, computed by multiplying one (1) percent of average final compensation prior to July 1, 1979, and three (3) percent of average final compensation after to July 1, 1979, times the number of years of credited service attributable to the disabled member multiplied by the vesting percent attributable to the member. The minimum non-service connected disability benefit for a member with at least ten (10) years of credited service shall be the greater of twenty-five (25) percent of average final compensation or the accrued pension payable immediately. 
(d)  Optional methods of disability retirement payments. In lieu of the benefits otherwise provided, any member awarded a disability retirement pursuant to this section may elect to have his disability retirement benefit payable under either of the options set forth in subsections 15-134(1) or 15-134(3). The value of optional disability retirement benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable.

Editor's note- The provisions of subsection (d) shall be effective December 31, 1999. 
Sec. 15-132. - Death benefits. 
(a)  Service-connected death. Upon the service-connected death of a member there shall be paid to such deceased member's surviving spouse, if any, for life, an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the final compensation paid to the member as determined from the average monthly wages paid to the deceased member during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding death. If there is no surviving spouse, this benefit shall be paid to the surviving minor children of the member during their minority or for a period of fifteen (15) years, whichever is greater. Absent a surviving spouse and surviving minor children, this benefit shall be paid to a beneficiary, designated by the member, for the beneficiary's life or a period of fifteen (15) years, whichever is less. This benefit shall be paid monthly commencing on the first day of the month following the death of the member. I addition to the foregoing benefit, there shall also be paid monthly to each surviving child of the deceased member under the age of eighteen (18) during that child's minority ten (10) percent of the final compensation paid to the deceased member. The total death benefit to be paid shall not, in any event, exceed one hundred (100) percent of the member's final compensation. A service-connected death is a death incurred while an employee is performing, directly or indirectly, services for the city. Death benefits paid to a surviving spouse shall not be effected by remarriage, provided the city continues to receive excise tax monies as provided in F.S. § 185.08. Notwithstanding the provisions described above in this subsection (a), in the event of the service-connected death of a member who is eligible for normal retirement, the benefit payable may not be less than the member's accrued pension benefit, and such benefit may not be payable for less than ten (10) years. An annual, compounded cost-of-living adjustment ("COLA") of three (3) percent shall be paid to any beneficiary receiving a service-connected death benefit pursuant to this subsection. 
(b)  Nonservice-connected death. Upon the nonservice-connected death of a member, there shall be paid to the beneficiaries of that member a lump sum consisting of the member's accumulated contributions, which are attributable to the time period through September 30, 1982, plus the actuarially reduced equivalent of the normal retirement benefit multiplied by the vesting percent attributable to the deceased member. Determination as to whether a death is nonservice-connected shall be made by the board of trustees after examination of findings and recommendations of the medical committee and from other evidence presented to the board. 
(c)  Death during qualified military service. In the case of a death or disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the participant are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the participant had resumed and then terminated employment by the city on account of death. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.28; Ord. No. 859, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 945, § 1, 5-28-96; Ord. No. 1127, § 1, 4-8-03; Ord. No. 1188, § 3, 7-12-05; Ord. No. 1348, § 2, 2-12-13; Ord. No. 1385, § 2, 4-28-15) 
Sec. 15-133. - Termination benefits. 
    Upon the termination of a vested or partially vested member for any reason, that member shall receive a monthly benefit for the rest of the member's life payable at the member's normal or early retirement date, as the member shall elect within six (6) months of the early retirement date, as a normal or early retirement benefit as determined by the provisions of this plan. In lieu thereof, the board may elect to make an immediate lump sum payment to the terminated member of the actuarially reduced equivalent of the monthly lifetime benefit multiplied by the vesting percentage attributable to the terminated member. This actuarially reduced equivalent shall be determined by reducing the lump sum amount by an average of zero point twenty-five (0.25) percent each month by which the termination date precedes the normal retirement date. In any event, a terminated member shall receive as a lump sum payment at the time of termination, if the member so elects, the member's contributions accumulated prior to October 1, 1982. A terminating member with less than five (5) years creditable service shall receive the member's contribution plus accrued interest accumulated since initial employment. Partially vested members shall receive the greater of the member contribution plus accrued interest or the member's vested benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section 15-133, no lump sum payment shall be made to a terminating member under this section unless the terminating member elects in writing in a form and manner determined by the board to receive such payment. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.29; Ord. No. 859, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 1064, § 5, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 1215, § 4, 12-12-06; Ord. No. 1307, § 6, 10-26-10) 
Sec. 15-134. - Optional methods of retirement payments. 
    Each member shall have the right at any time within six (6) months prior to his retirement date to irrevocably elect in lieu of benefits otherwise provided in this division and with the trustees' consent, one (1) of the retirement options set forth in this section. The ration of optional retirement benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable. The election by such member shall be by written request to the board of trustees. 
(1)  Joint and last survivor option. A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement benefit which provides a lifetime continuation of this benefit to another person, designated a "joint pensioner." The retiree will have the power to change such designation from time to time but any change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the pension board. The amount of retirement income payable shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the ages and sex of the previous joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the employee. The previous joint pensioner must be alive at the time the retiree elects to make a change. 
(2)  Lump sum option. A member may elect to receive in a lump sum at retirement an amount which is the actuarial equivalent to him under this plan. This option shall be calculated without reference to any cost of living allowance. However, employees who first become members on or after October 1, 2004 shall not be eligible for this lump sum option. 
(3)  Five or ten years certain basis. A member may elect to take a reduced benefit on a basis providing that such benefit shall be payable for a period of life and five (5) or ten (10) years certain in any event. 
(4)  Social security option. A member retiring under either early or normal retirement provisions and not for disability may elect to receive an increased benefit from the system until such time as social security benefits commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance throughout the period of his retirement. 
(5)  Partial lump sum/annuity option. A member may elect to receive a portion of his benefit in the form of a lump sum and a portion of his benefit in the form of an annuity option provided for in the plan. The value of the lump sum and annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the value of the benefits to which the member is otherwise entitled. The actuary for the system shall calculate the amount of a member's lump sum benefit and the amount of the annuity benefit in accordance with the actuarial assumptions set forth in the system. The lump sum portion of the benefit shall be calculated without reference to any cost of living allowance. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.30; Ord. No. 859, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 894, § 4, 2-23-93; Ord. No. 1059, § 7, 9-26-00; Ord. No. 1163, § 2, 9-28-04) 
Sec. 15-135. - Mandatory distribution date. 
(a)  A member's retirement allowance shall be distributed to him not later than the April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which he attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) years. Alternatively, distributions to a member must begin no later than the April 1 following such calendar year and must be made over the life of the member (or the lives of the member and the member's designated beneficiary) or the life expectancy of the member (or the life expectancies of the member and his designated beneficiary). 
(b)  For purposes of this section, the life expectancy of a member and the beneficiary of a participant (other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined, but not more frequently than annually. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan to the contrary, a form of retirement income payable from this plan, shall satisfy the following conditions: 
(1)  If the retirement income is payable before the member's death: 
a.  It shall either be distributed or commence to the member not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2), or the calendar year in which member retires; 
b.  The distribution shall commence not later than the calendar year defined above; and (a) shall be paid over the life of the member or over the lifetimes of the member and spouse, issue or dependent, or (b) shall be paid over the period extending not beyond the life expectancy of the member and spouse, issue or dependent. 
Where a form of retirement income payment has commenced in accordance with the preceding paragraphs and the member dies before his entire interest in the plan has been distributed, the remaining portion of such interest in the plan shall be distributed no less rapidly than under the form of distribution in effect at the time of the member's death. 
(2)  If the member's death occurs before the distribution of his interest in the plan has commenced, member's entire interest in the plan shall be distributed within five (5) years of member's death, unless it is to be distributed in accordance with the following rules: 
a.  The member's remaining interest in the plan is payable to his spouse, issue or dependent; 
b.  The remaining interest is to be distributed over the life of the spouse, issue or dependent or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the spouse, issue or dependent; and 
c.  Such distribution begins within one (1) year of the member's death unless the member's spouse, is the sole designated beneficiary, in which case the distribution need not begin before the date on which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2) and if the member's spouse dies before the distribution to the spouse begins, this section shall be applied as if the spouse were the member. 
(Code 1958, § 19-14.30; Ord. No. 859, § 1, 10-22-91; Ord. No. 1307, § 7, 10-26-10) 
Sec. 15-136. - Assignment of benefits. 
    All retirees shall be permitted to assign up to one hundred (100) percent of their benefits hereunder to another person or to a trust or up to ten (10) percent of their benefits hereunder to the City of North Miami; provided, however that such assignment shall be made voluntarily and shall be revocable. It is the intent of this provision to permit retirees to assign a portion of their benefits to the city so that such benefits may be contributed by the city to the city's flexible benefit plan. All assignments hereunder shall be revocable upon thirty (30) days' written notice provided to the board. Upon the effective date of a revocation all benefits to which the retiree is entitled shall from that point forward be paid to the retiree. 
(Ord. No. 894, § 5, 2-23-93; Ord. No. 928, § 3, 1-10-95) 
Sec. 15-137. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under subsection 15-133(2) and subsection 15-134(2) or (5), a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Retiree medical premiums for public safety officers. The plan may allow a public safety officer to elect a tax free distribution of up to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) annually directly to a retiree accident or medical plan or long-term care insurance contract on a pre-tax basis, so long as the public safety officer separates from service either at the plan's normal retirement age or due to his or her disability. Insurance premiums may be paid for the public safety officer, his spouse or his dependents while he is alive, but once he is deceased, the benefit ceases and may not be used by his spouse or beneficiaries to pay for their insurance premiums. Insurance premiums payments may only be made directly to the provider of the accident or health plan or qualified long-term care insurance contract. "Public safety officers" include law enforcement officers, firefighters, chaplains, rescue crew members or ambulance crew members. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.

(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective as of January 1, 2008, an employee's or former employee's non-spouse beneficiary is distributee with regard to the interest of the employee or former employee. 
(4)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non-direct) rollover.

Sec. 15-181. - Payment of costs, expenses and fees for setting up funds. 
(a)  At the first meeting of the police officers' fund committee the members shall examine all known bills of expense for setting up the fund and shall approve and allow for payment all those that are found to have been necessary and proper charges against the fund, and these bills shall be paid promptly. 
(b)  All costs and expenses for setting up the fund shall be paid from the monies received from the state in the year of 1968. Legal fees as affixed by the court or as fixed by contract for services rendered in securing monies due the fund from the city for the years 1955 through 1967 both inclusive shall be chargeable against funds received from the state in the year 1968. 
(Code 1958, § 19-25.21) 
Sec. 15-182. - Individual accounts to be established; credits to individual accounts. 
(a)  An individual account shall be established for each police officer of regular status on the effective date of this article, and for each police officer currently employed or retired who was in the employ of the city at any time after the enactment of Laws of Florida, 1953, chapter 28230 and for each police officer who attains regular status subsequent to the passage of this article. 
(b)  After payment of all costs, expenses and fees as monies are received from the state, the expenses of administering the fund for the preceding year shall be prorated by the committee and charged against monies received for police officers participants during the year. The balance of such monies shall be credited to the several individual participants in amounts directly proportionate to the total number of months of duty performed by the several police officers in the calendar year preceding the date the monies were received from the state. The length of time of service during the calendar year preceding the date upon which payment is received from the state is the only criterion upon which the amount due each participant out of the state monies received annually is to be calculated. No credit is to be given on account of seniority, rank or amount of compensation which the participants receive. Twenty (20) or more days' work in a calendar month shall be counted as a full month. Twenty (20) workdays shall be considered a full month. If a participant works less than twenty (20) days in a calendar month, he shall be credited with a fractional month, the fraction to be the number of days worked over twenty (20). For example, twelve (12) days worked would create a fraction of twelve-twentieths of a month. 
(c)  The amount of earnings from investments credited to the account of the participant shall bear the same ratio to the total amount of annual earnings as the invested funds belonging to the participant in the fund bear to the total monies invested on behalf of the fund. 
(d)  In addition to the monies received from the state and as earnings on investments, there shall be prorated and credited to the accounts of the individual participants, all forfeitures from police officers as provided for in subsection 15-183(1). Such sums shall be prorated to their individual accounts in the same manner as monies received from the state. 
(e)  Subsequent to the effective date of this article after a police officer as retired and ceased to be a member on active duty as defined in section 15-171, no credits shall be made to his account. Police officers who retire after the enactment of F.S. ch. 185 and prior to the effective day of this article, shall be entitled to participate in the monies they would have participated in had this article been in effect on the day of the enactment of F.S. ch. 185, but they shall not participate in any other monies. Benefits paid prior to the effective date of this article shall be deducted from his account. Monies credited to a participant's account shall be payable only upon the filing of an application with the special police officer's fund committee. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the committee and shall be sworn to by the applicant or his surviving wife or child or if the child is a minor by the guardian of the child or by any other person legally qualified to apply for such monies under the laws of the state. 
(Code 1958, § 19-25.22) 
Sec. 15-183. - Participant's benefits. 
    No participants shall receive benefits from the fund in excess of the amount credited to his account. Subject to this provision, a participant shall receive benefits as follows: 
(1)  Subsequent to the passing of this article, if a participant shall separate except by death from the service of the police department for any reason except as hereinafter provided, such participant shall have no claim on the fund and all monies remaining in an account after separation shall be forfeited to the fund. Police officers who separated from the city prior to the passage of this article and since enactment of Laws of Florida, 1953, chapter 28230, shall have no claim whatsoever on this fund. 
(2)  If a participant shall die while a member of the police department, the entire amount of his credit as of the date of his death shall be paid to the surviving spouse primarily for the purpose of defraying final illness and burial expenses. If there is no surviving spouse and there is a child or children, the entire amount of participant's credit as of the date of death shall be paid to the person designated in writing by the participant to be used for payment of final illness and burial expenses with any excess to be paid to legal guardian of the child or children for their benefit. If there is no surviving spouse or children, there shall be paid to the person designated in writing by the participant to be used for payment of final illness and burial expenses, an amount not to exceed the entire amount of his credit and any excess after payment of final illness and burial expenses shall be paid as designated by the deceased. If the person designated to act for a participant shall predecease him or cannot be located by reasonable effort or shall refuse to act or if the deceased participant has failed to designate anyone, the committee shall have the right to name a person to carry out the purposes of this subsection. In carrying out the purpose of this subsection, the committee shall endeavor to distribute any excess monies after payment of last illness and burial expenses in the same manner in which they would have been distributed in estate administration proceeding. The designation shall be in writing, sworn to, and shall be filed with the secretary of the committee. 
(3)  A participant who has been, since the enactment of Laws of Fla., 1953, chapter 28230, or shall hereafter be retired by reason of length of service or disability under any other pension plan of the city, or who shall voluntarily resign or terminate his employment with the city, shall be paid a graduated amount standing to his credit as of the date of such retirement or voluntary termination. The requirement or termination benefit to be paid to the retired or voluntarily terminated member shall, after five (5) years of service, be five-tenths of the amount standing to his credit. Each year after the fifth year of service, an amount equal to one-tenth will be added to the participant's retirement or termination benefit until the date of the tenth year of service, when the participant shall be entitled to the entire amount standing to his credit as a retirement or termination benefit. Resignation or termination must be voluntary in order that the participant may receive the termination benefits described in this subsection. The participant may elect to take such amount in a lump sum, or to take it in annual payments in a period not to exceed five (5) years. A written notice of election to receive payments other than in a lump sum must be filed with the committee upon a form prescribed by the committee therefor and must be sworn to by the person entitled to receive such monies. A retired participant who has elected to receive the monies due in annual payments, rather than in a lump sum as above, shall not be an active participant as defined by section 15-171. 
(4)  Settlement as provided in [subsections] (1), (2) and (3) above shall be in full settlement of all claims of a participant against the fund. He shall thereupon cease to be a participant. He shall have no further interest in the fund, and shall receive no further benefits. 
(5)  As an alternative to the above benefits, in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction shall find and order that a participant is entitled to benefits under Laws of Florida, 1953, chapter 28230 different from the benefits which that participant is entitled to receive under the terms of this article and such participant does not waive the benefits decreed by the court and accept benefits as provided by this article, the committee shall pay to such participant benefits as required by the decree or order of the court. Such benefits shall be paid from the fund, and in the event that it is necessary to pay such participant a greater amount than he would have received had he accepted benefits under this article, such additional amount shall be deducted from the counts of the other participants on a pro rata basis as determined by the committee. The fund shall indemnify the city against all claims of participants as aforesaid and shall pay all expenses including court costs and attorneys' fees incurred in defending the law suits brought by participants in asserting such claims.

Sec. 15-185. - Implementation of age retirement benefit. 
    After all monies now in the special police officers' fund are paid over to the special police officers' fund committee, the committee shall immediately pay into the North Miami employees' retirement system as provided by ordinance number 691 such sums as are necessary in the approximate amount of thirty-six thousand dollars ($36,000.00) in order to implement the age fifty (50) retirement benefit for police officers. The cost of such added benefit shall be borne equally by all current participants. 
(Code 1958, § 19-25.25) 
Sec. 15-186. - Disposition of monies received from city for years 1955-1967 pursuant to section 19-25.13. 
    All monies received from the city as provided for in section 15-173 for the years 1955 through 1967 shall be credited to the individual accounts of the police officer participating in the fund during the year for which the money was received plus interest earned for that year on the same pro rata basis as provided in subsection 15-183(2). Such benefits shall only apply to those still employed by the police department or those who have retired or retired and since died but not to those who have separated from the police department without retirement. The share of any retiree shall be reduced by the benefits already paid from this fund during such retirement.

Sec. 17-15. - Restoration of trenches. 
(a)  Description. The work specified in this section consists of backfilling trenches and restoring surfaces disturbed by the installation or maintenance of underground facilities within the limits of a public right-of-way or easement. This work shall be done in accordance with these specifications and the Metropolitan Dade County Public Works Manual. For the purpose of this section a trench cut two hundred (200) feet or less in length shall be considered a short trench, and a trench cut more than two hundred (200) feet in length shall be considered a long trench. The city will require either a concrete slab for restoring paved base course, boring under the pavement, copies of density tests showing compliance to the following requirements or copies of 10:1 cement mix backfill material. 
(b)  Trenches cut in new roadway prior to the construction of the base course. 
(1)  Before any excavation for underground facilities is begun, all required fill shall be in place and graded to subgrade elevation. 
(2)  After the structure is installed and inspected the trench and space around the structure to a level plane one (1) foot above the structure shall be backfilled in six-inch layers (compacted thickness) and shall be compacted to a density of not less than one hundred (100) percent of the maximum density as determined by the latest edition of AASHTO Specification T-99. Material shall be of selected fine earth material, one hundred (100) percent of which passes a one-inch sieve. Backfilling and compaction shall be carried out evenly on both sides of the structure in approximately level layers, and shall be performed in such a manner so as not to crack, damage or displace the structure. 
(3)  The remaining portion of the trench from a level plane one (1) foot above the top of the structure to the top surface of the subgrade or to the bottom of the base course shall be backfilled and compacted in layers not exceeding eight (8) inches to a density not less than one hundred (100) percent of maximum density as determined by the latest edition of AASHTO Specification T-99. All material used for backfill shall be of a quality acceptable to the city and shall be free from large lumps, wood or other extraneous material. 
(4)  Unless otherwise approved by the city engineer, trenches for direct burial cable or conduit shall be not less than six (6) inches in width and shall be deep enough to provide a minimum cover of twenty-four (24) inches whenever possible.

b.  The width of the slab shall be no less than two (2) feet greater than the width of the trench in order to provide a minimum bearing width of one (1) foot on each side. 
c.  Material. The slab shall be constructed of Class I concrete, and shall have a minimum strength of three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch and shall be reinforced with No. 6 gauge, six (6) inches by six (6) inches, wire mesh which shall meet the requirements of the latest edition of AASHTO Specification M-55. 
(3)  Limerock base. 
a.  The base shall meet the requirements for long trench restoration. 
b.  Compaction tests shall be furnished the city from a certified testing company. The tests shall be taken after each vertical foot of backfilling plus the base course and at such intervals as may be required by the city. 
c.  The city may waive the compaction tests if the applicant furnishes the city a cash bond equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of the cost of the restoration and backfilling work. The cost of the bond shall be as estimated by the city engineer with a minimum bond of two hundred dollars ($200.00). If during the period of one (1) year after completion of the work no street failures have occurred, the city will refund the bond upon request of the applicant. If during the one-year period street failure occurs, the applicant will be notified to restore the street failure within forty-eight (48) hours to the satisfaction of the city. If repairs are not made by the applicant, the city will utilize the bond to cause the repair to be made. The city reserves the right to extend the one-year requirement for refunding the bond to the applicant. 
(4)  Roadway surface. For all courses where a permanent pavement exists the concrete slab and the surrounding pavement edges shall be tack coated and a one-inch Type I asphaltic surface source shall be placed on the slab. 
(d)  Repair to long trenches cut parallel to roadway centerline requiring restoration of base course with or without surface course. 
(1)  Back fill and compaction. Backfill and compaction shall be performed as specified above.

c.  The base course shall have a minimum compacted thickness of eight (8) inches or equal to the existing base course thickness if greater than eight (8) inches. 
d.  The width shall be no less than two (2) feet greater than the width of the trench. 
(3)  Roadway surface. Where permanent pavement exists, the base course shall be primed, tack coated and surfaced with one (1) inch of Type I asphaltic concrete. Care shall be taken to tack coat and bond the edges of surrounding pavement. 
(e)  Miscellaneous restoration. Trenches cut across driveways, sidewalks, parkways, and concrete curbs, or curb and gutter shall be backfilled and compacted in accordance with this Code. The surface restoration shall be as follows: 
(1)  Driveways. A minimum of six (6) inches of limerock base, but not less than the thickness of the existing base, shall be placed above the subgrade. The width of the base shall be not less than two (2) feet greater than the width of the trench. The finish surface shall match the existing surface in type and thickness of material. 
(2)  Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks shall be restored in full sections or blocks to a minimum thickness of four (4) inches and six (6) inches at driveways. 
(3)  Park ways and easements. Parkways shall be restored to match exactly the existing section of parkway. Care shall be taken to prevent damage to trees, shrubs or bushes growing in the parkway area. 
(4)  Concrete curb or curb and gutter. All concrete curb or curb and gutter shall be restored to the existing height and cross section in full sections or lengths between joints. 
(f)  Special requirements. 
(1)  The restoration of all trenches and road surfaces disturbed by the installation or repair of underground facilities shall be completed as soon as reasonable and practical. 
(2)  No more than one thousand (1,000) feet of continuous trench shall be opened at any one (1) time under any single permit. Where deemed necessary by the city in the interest of public safety, convenience or traffic maintenance, the length of continuous open trench permitted may be reduced to less than one thousand (1,000) feet. In general it is not anticipated that any trench would be restricted to less than six hundred (600) feet except in a case of unusual circumstance. 
(3)  The contractor shall be responsible for the safety of any existing underground structure encountered during any part of the work. Incorrect locations or elevations shown on any plans shall not relieve the contractor of his responsibility for ensuring the safety of underground structures. 
(4)  In areas where traffic is to be maintained, a temporary asphalt mix shall be placed over the trench immediately after backfilling. 
(5)  The existing pavement shall be trimmed to neat, straight lines parallel or perpendicular to the roadway centerline. The width shall be equal to the maximum required by the trench excavation, before the permanent pavement replacement is made. The pavement replacement shall be smooth and even with the existing pavement. A bump or depression may justify the complete removal and replacement of the surface restoration. 
(6)  All other restoration shall be restored to a better condition than existed prior to commencement of the work. 
(g)  Traffic maintenance. Traffic maintenance shall conform to the requirements of Metropolitan Dade County. 
Sec. 17-16. - Grades to comply with specific maps.

Upon receipt of a written appeal, the city manager shall place the matter on a council agenda for consideration within forty-five (45) working days. Should the owner or the owner's representative not appear the determination of the cost to the owner shall be final, in accordance with F.S. § 337.404. 
(g)  A final order of the city imposed pursuant to Florida Statutes, and applicable provisions of the City Code, if any, shall constitute a lien on any property of the owner and may be enforced as provided therein. 
(h)  The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the public rights-of-way of the city, as the city manager in the exercise of reasonable discretion may determine to be necessary or appropriate in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall attempt to notify the owner of the facility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the owner of the facility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(i)  Upon cessation of all use of a facility within the public rights-of-way of the city, the owner of the facility shall notify the city within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice, the city may direct the facility owner to remove all or any portion of the facility if the city determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the removal of the abandoned facility by the owner of the facility, such owner, by its notice of cessation of all use to the city, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by the city, another utility or person. 
(j)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a facility owner agrees to provide the city, within thirty (30) days of filing or receipt of such, any document that may prevent compliance with the requirements of a permit in connection with the installation, construction or maintenance of its facilities, or use of facilities in the public right-of-way. This obligation shall only extend to such work in the public right-of-way for which a facility owner has applied for, or obtained a permit from the city. 
(Ord. No. 1072, § 1, 12-12-00) 
Sec. 17-208. - Use of rights-of-way. 
(a)  A facility owner agrees at all times to comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state statutes and local laws including, but not limited to, applicable zoning regulations not inconsistent with state and federal laws. 
(b)  Except in the case of an emergency, which shall include without limitation an out of service condition affecting 911 service, and which shall require subsequent notification to the city, no telecommunications service provider shall construct any facility under or within any public right-of-way which disrupts the public rights-of-way without first filing an application with and obtaining a permit from the city, pursuant to applicable permitting requirements of the city except as otherwise provided in this article. In case of the repair or maintenance of an existing facility, the city may impose lesser requirements than those set forth herein. Unless otherwise required by the City Code, no permit shall be required for installation and maintenance of service connections to customers' premises where there will be no disruption of the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  As part of any permit application, the facility owner shall provide a proposal for construction of the telecommunications facility that sets forth at least the following: 
(1)  The location of the proposed facility, including a description of the feet of plant to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of facilities and equipment that will be located in the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the system will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods and/or techniques), the time required to construct the system, a maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way, including information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other users of the public rights-of-way). Also, if appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way. Such plan shall include the timetable for construction for each phase of the project, and the areas of the city which will be affected. 
(d)  The city may request such additional information as it finds necessary to review an application for a permit to perform work in the public rights-of-way. The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the public rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of permittees to occupy and use the public rights-of-way. The city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the public rights-of-way, but may prohibit or limit placement of new or additional facilities in any public rights-of-way, for the protection of existing facilities in the public rights-of-way or future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined by the city to be in the public interest. 
(e)  All facilities shall be installed, located and maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching and/or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. The city manager may promulgate such rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a telecommunications facility in the public rights-of-way, as may be consistent with applicable law and not inconsistent with this article. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable Law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during construction, maintenance, and repair of the telecommunications facilities. 
(g)  In the event that at any time during the term of the rights granted herein the city shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade of, any public rights-of-way, upon reasonable notice by the city, the facility owner shall make any necessary removals, relaying and relocations of its telecommunications facilities at its own expense, in accordance with applicable law. 
(h)  A facility owner shall obtain any and all required permits and pay any and all required fees before commencing any construction on or otherwise disturbing any public rights-of-way as a result of its construction, except as provided herein. The facility owner shall, at its own expense, restore such property to as good a condition as existed prior to commencement of work. If such restoration is not performed in a reasonable and satisfactory manner to the city within thirty (30) calendar days after the completion of construction, the city may, after prior written notice to registrant, cause the repairs to be made at the facility's owner expense utilizing city employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10) percent of the cost against the registrant, and require reimbursement within ten (10) days after the submission of the bill by the city of registrant. Rates for labor and equipment shall be in accordance with City of North Miami Administrative Regulation 1-23, as amended. A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from negotiating with a facility owner for the installation of a city conduit in any open trench that may be permitted, or prohibit a facility owner from exercising its rights under 47 U.S.C. Section 224. 
(i)  All ongoing installation, construction and maintenance of a telecommunications facility located in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to the city's periodic inspection, upon no less than three (3) days written notice to the facility owner, for compliance with this article, or any applicable provisions of the City Code and/or administrative regulations. 
(j)  A facility owner shall not place its facilities so as to interfere unreasonably with any other person lawfully using the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(k)  A facility owner shall cooperate with the city by providing timely and complete information requested under this subparagraph. Upon completion of any installation or construction of new facilities in public right-of-way, at no cost to the city, the facility owner shall provide such information, as may be requested, showing the exact location of its facilities and structures, including but not limited to, as-built plans, maps, geographical information systems, plats, construction documents, drawings and any other information the city may find reasonably necessary. Such plans shall be provided in digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the facilities based on the city's geographical database datums, or other format acceptable to the city manager. All information required by this section shall be maintained in accordance with F.S. § 202.195. 
(l)  Suspension of permits. Subject to subsection (m) below, the city manager or a designee may suspend a permit for work in the public rights-of-way for one (1) or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of permit conditions, including conditions set forth in this article or other applicable provisions of the City Code or regulations governing use of public rights-of-way; or 
(2)  Misrepresentation or fraud by registrant in a permit application to the city; 
(3)  Failure to relocate or remove facilities as may be lawfully required by the city; 
(4)  Failure of registrant, its employees, agents or subcontractors in connection with the subject permit to (a) place barricades or signs around the work area, (b) take reasonable safety precautions to alert the public of work at the work site, or (c) repair, replace and restore any sidewalk, street, alley, pavement, water, sewer or other utility line or appurtenance, soil, landscaping, dirt or other improvement, property or structure of any nature. In the event of such failure, the city may perform the work utilizing city employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10) percent of the cost against the registrant, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the bill by the city to registrant. Rates for labor and equipment shall be in accordance with City of North Miami Administrative Regulation 1-23, as amended. 
(m)  Final, written decisions of the city suspending a permit or denying an application for a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the city within thirty (30) days of the date of the final, written decisions to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall be waived. The city council shall hear the appeal no later than forty-five (45) days from the end of the thirty (30) day appeal period, unless waived by the registrant. Upon correction of any violation that gave rise to a suspension or denial of permit, the suspension or denial shall be lifted. 
(n)  In the event registrant desires to use its existing facilities or to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or non-utility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing cable services, or any other services other than the provision of telecommunications service, or for providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a registrant shall seek such additional and separate authorization from the city for such activities as may be required by applicable law. In the event that a registrant is acting in its proprietary function as a retail provider of telecommunications equipment or appliances, registrant shall seek the appropriate permits, business tax receipt, and licenses from the city. 
(o)  To the extent that any person or registrant leases or otherwise uses the facilities of an entity that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place and maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way of the city, the person or registrant shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful exercise of the city's rights, including requiring the removal of such facilities from the public rights-of-way of the city, regardless of the effect on registrant's ability to maintain its own telecommunications facilities in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(p)  Termination of registration. The termination of a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the city council. The city may declare the registration terminated and revoke and cancel all privileges granted under that registration if (a) a federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification to provide telecommunications service, (b) the registrant's use of the public right-of-way presents a extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the right-of-way, or (c) the registrant abandons all of its facilities. prior to such termination by the city resulting from a violation of any of the provisions of this subparagraph, the registrant shall be notified by the city manager with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to such violation, and describing the action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice within which to cure the violation, or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the city council, to accomplish the same. In the event of such termination, the registrant shall, within a reasonable time following such termination, remove or abandon the facilities and take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the facilities remaining within the public right-of-way of the city safe. If the registrant has either abandoned its facilities or chooses to abandon its facilities, the city may either (1) require the registrant's bonding company to remove some or all of the facilities from the public right-of-way and restore the public right-of-way to its proper condition or (2) the city may require that some or all of the facilities be removed and the public right-of-way restored to its proper condition at the registrant's expense, utilizing city employees, agents or contractors, and charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10) percent of the cost against the registrant, and require reimbursement. Rates for labor and equipment shall be in accordance with City of North Miami Administrative Regulation 1-23, as amended. The obligations of the registrant hereunder shall survive the termination of the registration. In the event of a termination of registration, this provision does not permit the city to cause the removal of any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid certification with the governing federal and state telecommunications agencies and is properly registered with the city, for such certificated service, under this article.

(1)  Sidewalk cafes are restricted to the sidewalk area abutting or adjoining the boundary line of the property where the fast-food establishment or restaurant, owned or leased by the applicant is located. 
(2)  Permits will not be issued where the tables and chairs would be placed within four (4) feet of pedestrian crosswalk, bus stops, taxi stands, site triangles or other structures or areas determined by the city that may compromise the public's safety or fail to provide the necessary pathway clearance for the public. 
(3)  Tables, chairs, umbrellas and any other objects associated with the sidewalk cafe shall be of quality, design, materials and workmanship, to ensure the safety and convenience of users, and to enhance the visual and aesthetic quality of the urban environment.

(4)  Sidewalk cafes shall be located in such a manner that a distance of not less than four (4) feet is maintained at all times as a clear and unobstructed pedestrian path. For the purposes of the minimum clear path, parking meters, traffic signs, trees and all similar obstacles shall constitute obstructions. 
(5)  No object shall be permitted around the perimeter of an area occupied by tables and chairs which would have the effect of forming a physical or visual barrier discouraging the free use of the tables and chairs by the general public or which would have the effect of obstructing the pedestrian path or the public access. The staff review committee may permit the use of plant containers (planters), the number and size to be reviewed by the staff review committee at time of application. Placement of planters on permitted sidewalk cafe areas shall be five (5) feet centers (5'0" o.c.) or greater.

Hedges or other types of landscape which form a solid visual barrier in excess of eighteen (18) inches in width shall not exceed four (4) feet in height. 
(6)  Tables, chairs, umbrellas, decorative railings or fencing, or other permissible objects to designate the sidewalk cafes boundaries, including planters, shall be approved by the staff review committee prior to the issuance of a sidewalk cafe permit.

All umbrellas shall be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by the staff review committee based on compatibility with the surrounding urban area, the number, and proposed location of such umbrellas. Signs are prohibited on umbrellas, chairs, tables and other permissible fixtures which are located on the public right-of-way, except that the establishment name and/or its logo is permitted on umbrellas. Lettering and/or logos may not exceed eight (8) inches in height.

However, space heaters are permitted provided that they are an outdoor approved type, are located in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, and are located at least two (2) feet from the edge of any umbrella canvas, any foliage, or any other flammable object or material. 
(14)  Upon the issuance of a hurricane warning by the county, the permittee shall immediately, but no later than three (3) hours after a hurricane warning has been issued, secure and place indoors all tables, chairs and other equipment located on the sidewalk. The issuance of such a hurricane warning shall constitute an emergency situation as referenced in this article.

(h)  Damage to meters and valves. For damage to city meters and valves where the meter or city valves have been inadvertently or willfully damaged by the customer, all costs of repairs as established by administrative regulations shall be paid by the customer.

Sec. 19-76. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Air gap separation shall mean the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one (1) inch. 
    Auxiliary supply shall mean any water source or system other than the public water supply that may be available in the building or premises. 
    Backflow shall mean the flow other than the intended direction of flow of any foreign liquids, gases or substances into the distribution system of a public water supply. Backflow may degrade the quality of potable water below required standards. 
    Backflow prevention device shall mean a device that has been approved by the public works department and has been shown to meet the design and performance standards of the American Society of Sanitary Engineers ("ASSE") and/or the American Water Works Association ("AWWA") and that has been, or will be, installed according to city code. The purpose of a backflow prevention device is to prevent flow reversal through pipes or valves. 
    Back pressure shall mean backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the supply pressure. 
    Back siphonage shall mean a device to counteract back pressures or prevent back siphonage. 
    Cross connection shall mean any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage or other waste or substance of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be cross-connections. 
    Customer shall mean any individual, partnership, firm, association or other entity receiving water and/or sewer services from the city for consumption or usage. Customer includes the property owner, the tenant, or any person or entity in possession, if the property is in foreclosure. 
    Double check valve assembly shall mean an assembly composed of two (2) single, independently acting check valves including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the watertightness of each check valve. 
    Public water supply shall mean any system or water supply intended or used for human consumption or other domestic uses, including source, treatment, storage, transmission and distribution facilities where water is furnished to any community, collection or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use. 
    Reduced pressure principle back flow prevention device shall mean a device incorporating two (2) or more check valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two (2) checks, two (2) shutoff valves and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check valves at a pressure less than that on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2) pounds per square inch or less the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere thereby providing an air gap in the device.

(Code 1958, § 28-10.1; Ord. No. 1311, § 1, 11-14-10) 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 1311, adopted Nov. 14, 2010, changed the title of § 19-98 from "Water supply impact fees" to "Water and sewer capacity fees." 
Sec. 19-99. - Fire flow demand charge. 
(a)  A fire flow demand charge is established to facilitate the expansion and upgrading of the water facilities for the fire flow system of the water service area of the city. 
(b)  The charge shall be paid to the city prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or within thirty (30) days of demand by the city. Where a building permit is issued to replace an existing building which has previously paid a fire flow demand charge, the fee for the new building shall be adjusted to reflect this previous charge. 
(c)  The fire flow demand charge shall be fifty cents ($0.50) per gross square foot of floor area for new buildings, conversions of or additions to existing buildings that require two thousand (2,000) gallons per minute or less fire flow rate as set forth in section 2-103.21 of the Metropolitan Dade County Code, or as the same may hereafter be amended. Developers of projects with one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet or more of building area may apply for approval of a lower rate. 
(d)  The fire flow demand charge shall be one dollar ($1.00) per gross square foot of floor area for all new buildings and conversions of or additions to existing buildings that require greater than two thousand (2,000) gallons per minute as set forth in section 2-103.21 of the Metropolitan Dade County Code, or as the same may hereafter be amended. Developers of projects with fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of building area may apply for approval of a lower rate. 
(e)  A conversion shall be defined as a change in the existing building to a use requiring a higher degree fire protection as determined by the city engineer. 
(f)  Specifically exempted from payment of a charge shall be a structure requiring a fire flow rate of less than one thousand (1,000) gallons per minute and parking garages under three (3) stories. 
(g)  Where water main extensions including fire hydrants are needed to meet the requirements of section 2-103.21 of the Metropolitan Dade County Code, or as the same may hereafter be amended, the fire flow demand charge shall be reduced by the cost of the improvements when constructed by the developer in accordance with law. Where the cost of such improvements exceed the fire flow demand charge, the developer shall fund the entire cost with no participation by the city. 
(h)  The computation of the gross square foot area shall be made from the exterior dimensions, including all columns, stairways, hallways and vestibules. 
(i)  All monies collected shall be held in a fire flow demand fund account. 
(j)  The allocation of funds may be made for any water system capital improvement project including fire hydrants, to correct fire flow system deficiencies, as approved by the Dade County Fire Department and the City Council of North Miami. 
(k)  This section shall apply to buildings to be constructed or converted under a building permit issued after May 25, 1984, unless a prior water service-agreement for such building or conversion existed prior to this date. 
(Code 1958, § 28-11) 
Sec. 19-100. - Inspection of new facilities. 
(a)  Where water facilities are installed by other than city employees, the work shall be inspected and certified to ensure compliance with all federal, state, county and city requirements. The city shall perform the following mandatory inspections at the listed fees:

Reinspection, each ..... 10.00 
(2)  Pressure test water main extension, each ..... 100.00

Reinspection, each ..... 50.00 
(2)  Backflow certification for lawn sprinkler systems, each ..... 25.00 
(3)  Field inspection to certify compliance to specifications, per hour for a period as determined by the city ..... 35.00 
(c)  All costs are based on normal working hours of city employees and other hours of service will result in increased fees. All fees must be paid prior to the work being performed unless otherwise approved by the director of public works. The contractor shall pay for all laboratory testing as may be required by regulatory agencies. 
(Code 1958, § 28-32) 
Sec. 19-101. - Discontinuance of service for failure to pay water or sewerage bills. 
    The water and sewer department is hereby authorized and empowered to interrupt and discontinue its water and sewerage services to any user thereof upon the subject user's failure to pay either the water or sewerage charges, or both, so long as such water or sewerage charges shall remain unpaid, as provided by law. 
(Code 1958, § 28-13) 
Sec. 19-102. - Private fire service protection. 
(a)  The charges or rates for special private fire service based upon the size of the connection with the water department's distributing system thereof, are as follows: 
Per month

(b)  The cost of the installation of private fire service is to be paid for by the owner at actual cost plus ten (10) percent. 
(c)  The water department shall install fire line connections into a building up to the property line upon the owner signing a regular form of contract containing the following conditions: 
(1)  This connection is to be used for fire purposes only and is to have no connection whatsoever with any taps that may be used for other than fire purposes. And because of the danger of pollution shall have no connection with any other source of supply with the exception in case a tank or fire pump is installed as secondary supply. There shall be a check valve installed in each city connection to prevent the water from these secondary supplies running back into the city mains. 
(2)  The owner shall not draw any water what ever through this connection for any purpose except the extinguishment of fires, or for periodic tests of the fire system, which tests shall be made in the presence of a representative of the water department. 
(3)  Any authorized representative of the water department shall have free access to the buildings at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting any equipment of the water department. 
(4)  At some future date when convenient with the water department, and if and in the event the water department so desires and instructs such owner, the owner shall set in this connection at the line dividing the property of the owner and the street or alley, a weighted check valve, which check valve shall be satisfactory to the insurance companies, and also to the water department; such check valve shall be fitted with a bypass, on which shall be set a meter, the purpose of which shall be to indicate whether or not water is being used through this connection, and for the further purpose of showing any leakage, if same exists. 
(5)  Violation by the owner of any of the provisions in this section shall terminate the contract, disconnect pipe or pipes, or stop the flow of water through same. 
(6)  The right is reserved by the water department to shut off the supply at any time in case of accident, or to make alterations, extensions, connections or repairs and if possible the water department agrees to give due and ample notice of shutoff. 
(7)  The water department shall not make any guarantee as to a certain pressure in this pipe or in the main supplying the same, and shall not be under any circumstances, held liable for loss or damage to the owner for a deficiency or failure in the supply of water, whether occasioned by shutting off water in case of accident or alterations, extensions, connections or repairs, or for any cause whatsoever. 
(8)  When fire line valves or connections are used in case of fire or for any other reason whatsoever, the owner shall immediately notify the water department and the water department shall forthwith reseal the used valves or connections. 
(Code 1958, § 28-14; Ord. No. 881, § 7, 9-24-92) 
Sec. 19-103. - Application for service; binding contract; cancellation of application. 
(a)  All applications for water supply service must be made at the office of the water department in the city, on a blank prepared by the water department for that purpose. 
(b)  The owner or owners of the premises proposed to be connected for water supply service, or his or their agents thereunto duly authorized in writing, must sign the application for service pipe and water supply, except as hereinafter provided. 
(c)  Such application becomes a binding contract upon both the owner and the water department when the service connection for water supply service applied for has been installed and completed. Prior to the installation and completion of such service connection, the owner may cancel or withdraw the application made, upon his written order so to do, after payment to the water department of the actual expense not less than one dollar ($1.00) incurred by the water department in connection therewith. 
(Code 1958, § 28-15) 
Sec. 19-104. - Term of contract for water service. 
    All contracts for water supply service shall expire at the end of the next succeeding calendar month from date of application, but all contracts shall continue in force by renewal without act or notice from either party to the other, from month to month, unless ten (10) days' notice in writing is given by either party to the other of a desire to terminate the contract at the expiration of the then calendar month, and the charging for and payment of water rates or rents weekly, or in a manner, and at any interval or period, other than monthly, shall not be construed as altering the period of the contract or any renewal thereof under this section. 
(Code 1958, § 28-16) 
Sec. 19-105. - Change of ownership or occupancy of premises. 
    In the event of any change in ownership or occupancy of any premises connected to the system, the water department shall be immediately notified in writing of such change, giving in such notice the name and address of the new owner or occupant. In the absence of such application by such new owner or occupant, the use of the water department service may, at the option of the water department, be taken and construed to be an acceptance by such new owner or occupant of all the contract obligations of the preceding owner with and to the water department. In the event any owner fails to notify the water department in writing of a change in ownership or occupancy of any premises for water supply service, such owner shall continue to be liable to the water department for all rates and charges accrued and accruing for such service until either the end of the contract period, in which he may later notify the water department of his desire to cancel, or the water department shall, of its own volition, have cancelled the contract with the owner, but this clause shall not preclude the water department from also demanding from the new owner or occupant the payment of all or any charges and rates which shall, at the time of such demand, be unpaid or unsecured, without regard to whether the same accrued prior or subsequent to such change in ownership or occupancy. Upon failure of such new owner to comply with such demand within twenty-four (24) hours after written notice thereof, the water department shall have the right to shut off the water supply and discontinue its service. In no case of change of ownership shall the preceding owner or owners be released from any contract obligations to and with the water department until the expiration of the contract period, properly terminated in accordance with this chapter except at the option of the water department, evidenced by a written release from the water department. 
(Code 1958, § 28-17) 
Sec. 19-106. - Date charges commence. 
    When application for water supply service is made, the service together with the charges and rates therefor, shall begin on the date of the completion of the service connection by the water department, unless the owner shall state in writing in the application that such service connection shall be shut off immediately upon its installation in which even the said connection shall be shut off, and shall thereafter be turned on by the water department only upon the request, in writing, of the owner and the charges and rates for water supply service shall commence from date of such turn-on in accordance with this chapter in every respect as though such turn-on request had been an original application. Whenever, in a case as hereinabove provided, there shall have been a change in ownership prior to the turn-on of the service connection, the new owner must sign the application for water supply upon the regular form. 
(Code 1958, § 28-18)

After the city has determined that the nonfunctioning portion of the sewer lateral is within the city public rights-of-way, the city will clean and/or commence repairs to that portion of the lateral within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of notice. In order to receive this service, the city may require the customer to allow the installation of a cleanout on his property near the right-of-way line. The fee for this assistance shall be determined by the city manager as may be set forth by administrative regulation. 
(g)  Maintenance of grease traps. All businesses having grease traps, as required by the South Florida Building Code, that are connected to the sanitary sewer system of the City of North Miami shall properly maintain such traps in the condition for which they were intended. To ensure compliance, each business occupant shall have the grease trap inspected semiannually by a licensed firm qualified to perform such service and if required, the grease trap shall be cleaned or repaired. A certificate of compliance by the licensed firm shall be submitted to the city. The city may require more frequent cleaning if it is proven that semiannual cleanings are not effective in preventing grease from entering the city sewer system. Failure to provide for the certification of compliance shall be sufficient reason for the city to take the necessary steps as prescribed by law to cause the system to be inspected. If such an inspection identifies a condition threatening to the public health, the city shall have the option to terminate water or sewer service to the business occupant.

    As authorized pursuant to Chapter 403, Florida Statutes, a stormwater utility is created consistent with the City of North Miami's Comprehensive Plan, and stormwater utility fees are established to plan, construct, operate and maintain a stormwater management system. The "stormwater management system" is the system designed, constructed and implemented to control discharges which are necessitated by rainfall events, incorporating methods to collect, convey, store, absorb, inhibit, treat, use or reuse water to prevent or reduce flooding, overdrainage, environmental degradation and water pollution or otherwise affect the quantity and quality of discharges from the system. The "stormwater utility" is the funding of the stormwater management system by assessing the cost of the program to the beneficiaries based on their relative contribution to its need. It is operated as a typical utility which bills services regularly, similar to water and wastewater services. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 2-10-98) 
Sec. 19-239. - Definitions. 
    The following words, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows: 
    BMP (Best Management Practice). Any stormwater treatment facility (including, but not limited to, a drainage well, exfiltration basin, grass swale, retention, or detention pond, and pumping stations) installed according to accepted engineering design criteria for the purpose of reducing the discharge of pollutants. 
    Charges. All fees applicable for stormwater services incurred and/or billed by the city's utility billing system for services incurred. 
    Consumer. The entity billed for stormwater services in any premises supplied by the city. 
    Developed property. Any parcel of land that contains a building, structure, or an impervious area. 
    Dwelling. Any building that is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living, sleeping, cooking and eating. 
    Dwelling unit. A room, or group of rooms, occupied, or intended to be occupied as separate living quarters by one (1) family with independent cooking and sleeping facilities. 
    ERU (equivalent residential usage unit). The statistically estimated average of impervious area of residential developed properties per dwelling unit within the City of North Miami. This estimated average (which equals one thousand seven hundred sixty (1,760) square feet) is calculated by dividing the total estimated impervious area of residential properties by the estimated total number of dwelling units. 
    Impervious area. The horizontal ground surface that is not readily penetrated by rainwater. This shall include, but not be limited to, all structures, slabs, patios, porches, driveways, sidewalks, parking areas, athletic courts, decks and roofs. 
    Non-residential developed property. Any parcel of land with impervious area that does not contain only dwellings or dwelling units. 
    Residential developed property. Any parcel of land with impervious area that contains only dwellings or dwelling units. 
    Stormwater infrastructure. The structural, non-structural, or natural features of a parcel of land or watershed which collect, convey, store, absorb, inhibit, treat, use, reuse, or otherwise affect the quality or quantity of stormwater.

Sec. 19-241. - Stormwater utility fees. 
(a)  A stormwater utility fee shall be assessed against each property within the City of North Miami. To assess the foregoing fee against each property within the City of North Miami, the finance department shall establish an account for each property (or each use thereon) based upon City of North Miami utility accounts, applications for service, and Miami Dade County Tax Assessor property information or other ownership records. 
(b)  For the purpose of this article, each dwelling unit is assigned one (1) ERU. For properties which do not contain a dwelling unit (i.e., non-residential developed properties), the ERU is calculated by dividing the impervious area on the property by one thousand seven hundred sixty (1,760) square feet (e.g., a non-residential developed property containing three thousand five hundred twenty (3,520) square feet of impervious area is equivalent to two (2) ERUs). 
(c)  The monthly fee assessed against each account shall be determined by multiplying four dollars and ninety-three cents ($4.93), the stormwater utility service charge, by the number of ERUs for each account. The amount of such fee shall be shown as a separate item on water bills (or as shown on a stormwater utility bill if no water bill is issued) and shall be paid by the owner, tenant or occupant in possession of the premises at the same time and in the same manner as is provided in this chapter for the payment of water bills. 
(d)  For the purpose of calculating stormwater utility fees, the calculations of ERUs is based upon property usage. The property usage shall be determined by the finance department based on, but not be limited by, state and county land use codes, tax assessments, business tax receipts and site inspections. 
(e)  Any authorized representative of the public works or finance department shall have free access to the properties at any reasonable time for the purpose of determining property usage for the purpose of calculating stormwater utility fees and obtaining billing account information. 
(f)  The number of ERUs calculated for each account shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. (e.g., 4.1 is equivalent to 4 ERUs and 4.5 is equivalent to 5 ERUs). 
(g)  The minimum charge assessed against each property shall be one (1) ERU. 
(h)  The fees collected by the city with respect to the stormwater utility, together with investment earnings, shall be deposited in the stormwater utility fund and shall be used exclusively for planning, constructing, financing, operating, repairing and maintaining the stormwater utility and the infrastructure of the stormwater management system. The city may pledge such fees as security for indebtedness incurred by it in connection with the stormwater utility and the stormwater management system. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 2-10-98; Ord. No. 999, § 1, 9-23-98; Ord. No. 1151, § 1, 11-25-03; Ord. No. 1192, § 1, 9-21-05; Ord. No. 1231, § 1, 5-23-07) 
Sec. 19-242. - Stormwater utility fee reductions. 
    Fee reductions, as specified below, are available for properties meeting the following criteria: 
(1)  A fee reduction of fifty (50) percent shall be applied to that portion of the property meeting the following criteria: 
The property is subject to a valid National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater discharge permit which drain to waters of the U.S. as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
(2)  A fee reduction of fifty (50) percent shall be applied to that portion of the property meeting the following criteria: 
The property is served by privately owned and maintained BMPs that are or would be required for development under current applicable state, county, and city criteria capturing a volume equal to the maximum of: 
(2.50 inches) times (the impervious fraction of the area draining to the BMP) times (the area draining to the BMP), 
-or- 
(1.00 inch) times (the area draining to the BMP). 
(3)  A fee reduction of fifty (50) percent of the volume fraction shall be applied to that portion of the property meeting the following criteria: 
The property is served by privately owned and maintained best management practices (BMPs) that are or would be required for development under current applicable state, county, and city criteria capturing a volume less than that in subsection (b) above. For purposes hereof "volume fraction" equals (provided volume) divided by (required volume pursuant to subsection (b) above). 
(4)  In order to apply for a fee reduction, property owners must submit a completed affidavit/application (in a form to be established by the city) to the finance department. Upon verification by a representative of the city that the above criteria have been satisfied and the property owner is entitled to a fee reduction, fee reductions shall be applied retroactive to the date of the application. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 2-10-98) 
Sec. 19-243. - Authority to manage. 
(a)  The public works department is authorized to determine and prescribe the requirements of the stormwater management system (including all components of the infrastructure) and all necessary or desirable alterations, repairs and extensions to manage and control stormwater runoff, provided such action serves a public purpose. 
(b)  The city and the public works department have not, and shall not, make any guarantee as to the amount of stormwater runoff managed by the stormwater management system, the time intervals required to effectuate such management of runoff, or any other aspect of the stormwater management system and the management of runoff, and shall not be, under any circumstances, held liable for loss, damage or adverse consequences suffered by or to the owner or his property arising out of a deficiency or failure in the stormwater utility.

    In the event of any change in ownership or occupancy of any premises connected to the system, the finance department shall be immediately notified in writing of such change, giving in such notice the name and address of the new owner or occupant. The use of utility services shall be deemed and construed to be an acceptance by a new owner or occupant of the obligations of the preceding owner, including the obligation to pay all stormwater utility fees, to the city. In the event any owner fails to notify the finance department in writing of a change in ownership or occupancy of any premises for stormwater utility service, such owner shall continue to be liable to the city for all fees accrued and accruing for such service until a new account is established for the new owner or occupant. However, the foregoing provision shall not preclude the finance department from also demanding from the new owner or occupant the payment of all or any fees or deposits which shall, at the time of such demand, be unpaid or unsecured, without regard to whether the same accrued prior or subsequent to such change in ownership or occupancy. In no case of change of ownership shall the preceding owner be released from any contract obligations to the finance department accruing prior to the establishment of a new account for the new owner or occupant, except at the option of the finance department, evidenced by a written release from the city. Any notice of change in ownership or occupancy of any premises connected to the city's water system pursuant to section 19-105 of this Code shall be deemed sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement and the change shall be applicable to the stormwater utility account for the premises. 
(Ord. No. 989, § 1, 2-10-98) 
Sec. 19-245. - Enforcement; penalties.

(2)  If a repeat violation is found, the code compliance officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code compliance officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the special magistrate and request a hearing.

The special magistrate may take "judicial notice" of matters in previous cases and in other city files. 
(b)  Notice/fines. The notice of hearing must recite that the alleged violation is a repeat violation, and if the property is again brought into compliance before the hearing, the special magistrate shall make a determination that future findings of the same violation shall make said violations eligible to be "fined" in the amount of repeat violations. The notice of hearing is in addition to the notice that the code compliance officer shall provide to the violator. 
(Ord. No. 1362, § 1, 12-10-13) 
Sec. 21-20. - Fines; costs of repair. 
(a)  The special magistrate, upon notification by the code compliance officer that a previous order of the special magistrate has not been complied with by the set time, or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate for compliance or in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code compliance officer. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 21-16(c)(1), the special magistrate shall notify the city manager or city manager's designee, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. If a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to this subsection.

(1)  Pay the penalty in the manner indicated on the civil violation ticket and correct the violation within the time specified on the ticket; or

(c)  If the named violator, after notice, fails to pay the civil violation ticket and correct the violation within the time specified or fails to timely request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate, such failure shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing before the special magistrate. A waiver of the right to administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation, and penalties shall be assessed pursuant to the amount stated in the civil violation ticket. 
(Ord. No. 1362, § 1, 12-10-13) 
Sec. 21-33. - Civil violation ticket appeals.

(g)  Each party shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues, to impeach any witness and to rebut the evidence against the witness. 
(h)  The special magistrate shall make findings of fact based on the evidence presented. In order to uphold the decision of the code compliance officer, the special magistrate must find that the greater weight of the evidence shows the existence of a code violation and that the named violator committed or was responsible for the violation.

(2)  Reasonable costs and expenses of the administrative hearing; and

A fine imposed pursuant to this division shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city and the city manager or its designee, may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. The city may also recover reasonable attorney's fees and court costs in connection with such enforcement actions. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the city council may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the liens or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest and costs. 
(c)  No lien provided for by this section shall continue for a longer period than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action is commenced pursuant to F.S. § 162.09(3), in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or for money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in the action. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien, effected by the commencement of the action, shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(d)  No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the Florida Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the Florida Constitution.

Sec. 30-17. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  As of the date of this chapter, the State of Florida Simplified Communications Service Tax, F.S. ch. 202, prohibits the obligations imposed on franchisee in this section and this section 30-17 is severable from this chapter and has no effect on the remaining valid portions of this chapter.

In no event shall a franchisee pay a franchise fee greater than the maximum permitted by applicable law.

A certified public accountant or duly authorized officer of the franchisee shall certify the statement. The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
(e)  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the city of any franchise fee payment shall be construed, as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable. 
(f)  Unless prohibited by applicable law, the city may, from time to time, and upon reasonable notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and may re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise, subject to the applicable statute of limitations. If, as a result of the audit, the city determines that the franchisee has underpaid the quarterly franchise fees owed in an amount equal to or exceeding three (3) percent of the franchise fees actually paid based on components of gross revenues as specifically defined herein, the cost of the audit shall be paid by the franchisee to the city within forty-five (45) days of receipt of demand for payment, unless franchisee can show the audit is materially incorrect.

For example, a notice that an affiliate which has a management contract for the city's system was not in compliance with FCC EEO requirements would be deemed to affect or bear on operations in the city. 
(6)  A franchisee shall provide the city, within thirty (30) days of filing or receipt of any petition or filing with any federal, state, or local agencies or courts, which may in the reasonable judgment of the franchisee, adversely impact the construction, operation or maintenance of franchisee's cable system, affect city and/or subscribers regarding this chapter or a franchise agreement including, but not limited to any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy.

(h)  Disconnection. 
(1)  Voluntary disconnection. 
(i)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
(ii)  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests from the cable system of the franchisee. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee.

At the request of a subscriber, a franchisee shall remove all of its facilities and equipment from the premises of the subscriber within thirty (30) calendar days of the request. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable or internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise, provided, however, that such agreement must be consistent with applicable law and FCC rules. 
(i)  Franchisee shall intentionally interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.

In cases where requests for service have been ignored or in cases where the service provided is alleged to be in non-compliance with this chapter or a franchise agreement, the city manager or his designee shall have the power to require the franchisee to provide service consistent with the terms of the franchise, if in the opinion of the city manager or his designee such request for service is reasonable. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, including the franchisee, may appeal the matter to the city council for hearing and determination. The city council may accept, reject or modify the decision of the city manager. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise, whether instituted by the city manager or by the city council, shall be contrary to the provisions of this chapter, any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter or this agreement, and neither the city manager nor the city council, in the adjustment, settlement, or compromise of any controversy shall have the right or authority to add to, modify or delete any provision of the ordinance or of the franchise or this agreement, or to interfere with any rights of subscribers or any franchisee under applicable federal, or state law or private contract.

The franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written notice to file a written response to the notice of the city manager. Written response of the franchisee shall be signed by management level employee of franchisee and all statements contained will be regarded as material representations to the city. 
(3)  Prior to assessing a fine, the city manager or designee shall consider any justification or mitigating factor advanced in the written response of the franchisee, including but not limited to rebates or credits to the subscriber or a cure or commencement of a cure of the violation.

(4)  Subsequent to the notice of proposed or fine to franchisee and consideration of the response of the franchisee, if any, the city manager may after a public hearing at which franchisee shall have an opportunity be heard, issue an assessment of fine. Any fine will commence as of the date of the written notice specifying the violation at issue. The fine shall be paid within thirty (30) days of written notice of assessment to the franchisee, or if franchisee challenges the assessment in a court of competent jurisdiction, within thirty (30) days of a final non-appealable decision that the assessment is valid. This fine shall constitute liquidated damages to the city for the violation and the city may enforce payment of the refund or fine in any court having jurisdiction.

(x)  In addition to complying with the customer service standards set forth in this chapter or in any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter, a franchisee shall comply with all customer service standards applicable to cable systems of the FCC and any other applicable federal, state or county law concerning customer service standards, consumer protection, and unfair or deceptive trade practices. 
(y)  The city expressly reserves the right to consider violations of the customer service requirements in evaluating any renewal, modification or transfers of any franchise.

In the event franchisee provides notice to the city, the city manager may suspend any customer service standard for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days to allow for the city to consider franchisee's showing and to allow the city to consider any modifications of the customer service standards that may be deemed appropriate by the city. 
Sec. 30-20. - Subscriber privacy.

A franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved areas in as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done, and shall also make and keep full and complete plats, maps and records showing the exact locations of its facilities located within the public streets, ways, and easements of the city. These maps shall be available to the city manager. 
(b)  Except to the extent required by law, a franchisee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove, any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or widening, change of street grade, installation or sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal or public utility improvements; provided, however, that the franchisee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place.

(f)  All wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners.

(g)  All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents of the city of their use of any street or any other public right-of-way. 
(h)  A franchisee shall, at all times: 
(1)  Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the city's building code and electrical safety ordinances and any other applicable building or electrical safety code, and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of the city.

(i)  On streets where electrical or telephone utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and a subscriber's residence, a franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. The city shall encourage, to the extent feasible, that the public utility and the franchisee cooperate in opening up trenches and making such trenches available to all parties with the understanding that the costs of opening and refilling of such trenches would be shared equally by all users of such trenches. 
(j)  In the event the use of any part of a cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or in the event such System or property has been installed in any street without complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or expired, the franchisee, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the city, shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the city may require.

(1)  Impose liquidated damages in such amount, whether on a per-diem, per-incident, or other measure of violation, as provided in the franchise agreement. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement and the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  Revoke the franchise in accordance with federal and state law, due process and the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter pursuant to the procedures specified in section 30-25.

(c)  Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of a franchise agreement or this chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
Sec. 30-24. - Renewal of franchise. 
    A renewal of a franchise shall be conducted in a manner consistent with section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 546. To the extent such additional requirements are consistent with applicable law, the following requirements shall apply. 
(a)  Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 546, should that process be invoked, the city shall notify the franchisee, by certified or registered mail that it may file a renewal application including a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of the notice. 
(1)  The application shall comply with the requirements of section 30-9(a), (b), (c), (g) and (i) and provide the specific information requested in the notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the date specified in the city's notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this subsection, which shall in no event be less than one hundred twenty (120) days, the city may take such action as appropriate under law. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The city, following prior public notice, may hold one (1) or more public hearings on the renewal application. 
(b)  In the event a public hearing on the renewal application is held, or in the event that the city council considers the renewal application without a public hearing, the city council will either: 
(1)  Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, pursuant to a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the franchisee; or 
(2)  Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. 
(c)  If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D). Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with 47 U.S.C. § 546(b) shall be based on one (1) or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D), pursuant to the record of proceedings under 47 U.S.C. § 546(c). The city shall not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under Section 546(c)(1)(A) or on events considered under section 546(c)(1)(B) unless the city has provided the franchisee with notice and opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object, or the franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the city fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(d)  Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546 (a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(h). The city may hold one (1) or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the city council shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. 
(e)  If the city council grants a renewal application, the city and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in subsections 30-9(e) through (h) of this chapter, before such renewal becomes effective. 
(f)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied, the city may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer or ownership of the system to another person upon approval of the city council pursuant to Section 547 of the Communications Act. The city may not acquire ownership of the system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system while an appeal of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(e). Any acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. 
(g)  If renewal of a franchise is lawfully denied and the city does not purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system to another person, the city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense if the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense. 
Sec. 30-25. - Transfers. 
(a)  No transfer of any portion of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(b)  An application for a transfer of a franchise shall meet the requirements of section 30-8 and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and other material and lawful qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. Except in the case of a pro forma transfer, the application shall provide, at a minimum, all information required in section 30-9 with respect to the proposed transferee. 
(c)  The application process shall not include any pro forma transfers, as defined herein, mortgages and pledges of franchisee's securities, but shall require proper notice to the city pursuant to the terms of the ordinance or the franchise agreement. 
(d)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the city council shall consider the legal, financial, technical and material and lawful other qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in substantial compliance with its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance, and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers. The city council shall not unreasonably withhold approval to any such transfer. 
(e)  No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume all obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement. The city shall certify to franchisee, upon request, all issues of franchisee's performance that are known and pending. However, such certification shall not represent a waiver or release by the city of any violations of the ordinance or franchise by the franchisee. 
(f)  Subject to applicable law, approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
Sec. 30-26. - Revocation or termination of franchise. 
(a)  A franchise may be revoked by the city council for a franchisee's failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, or for any other material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise agreement. To invoke the provisions of this subsection (a), the city shall give the franchisee written notice, by certified mail at the last known address, that franchisee is in material violation of this chapter or in material breach of the franchise agreement and describing the nature of the alleged violation or breach with specificity. If within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of such written notice from the city to the franchisee, the franchisee has not cured such violation or breach, or has not commenced corrective action to the satisfaction of the city and such corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to revoke the franchise, stating its reasons. 
(b)  Prior to revoking a franchise under paragraph (a) the city council shall hold a public hearing, upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing the city council may determine whether to revoke the Franchise based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and other evidence of record. If the city council determines to revoke a franchise, it shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee. 
(c)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, any franchise may, at the option of the city following a public hearing before the city council, be revoked one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred twenty (120) day period: 
(1)  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
(2)  Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(d)  In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the Franchise, consistent with the procedures of set forth in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, including but not limited to a public hearing before the city council, by serving notice upon the franchise and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
(1)  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and 
(2)  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this chapter. 
(e)  If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers for a period of six (6) months, the following procedures and rights are effective: 
(1)  The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's or surety's expense. 
(2)  The city, by resolution of the city council, may acquire ownership, or effect a transfer, of the cable system in accordance with Section 547 of the Communications Act. 
(3)  If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system. 
(f)  Where the city has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system upgrade or rebuild or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, may result in the revocation of the franchise by a resolution of the city council, unless the city, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time. 
(g)  No adverse action against a franchisee pursuant to this section, except as consistent with the procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, including a noticed public hearing at which the franchisee is given an opportunity to be heard. 
Sec. 30-27. - Continuity of service mandatory. 
(a)  It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services from the franchisee so long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied. 
(b)  In the event of a termination or transfer of a franchise for whatever reason, the franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The franchisee shall cooperate with the city to operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six (6) months without the franchisee's written consent. During this period the cable system shall be operated under such terms and conditions as city and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator. 
(c)  In the event a franchisee fails to operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause, the city may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or until a permanent operator is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the city for all costs or damages resulting from the franchisee's failure to perform that are in excess of the revenues from the system received by the city. Additionally, the franchisee will cooperate with the city to allow city employees or city agents free access to the franchisees' facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system operation. 
Sec. 30-28. - Rates. 
(a)  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the city from regulating rates for cable services to the full extent permitted by law. 
(b)  Any rate or charge established for cable television service, equipment, repair and installation shall comply with applicable law. Where FCC guidelines exist, franchisee's compliance with such guidelines shall be considered reasonable. 
Sec. 30-29. - Performance evaluation. 
    The city may conduct periodic performance evaluations of a franchisee as the city determines is necessary, but in no event more frequently than bi-annually, unless it determines in good faith that franchisee's performance with this chapter or its franchise agreement is deficient, based upon subscriber complaints, or as the city otherwise determines is reasonable. A franchisee shall fully cooperate with these evaluations in good faith. An evaluation session shall be properly noticed and open to the public. 
Sec. 30-30. - Administration. 
(a)  The city manager, either directly or through a duly appointed designee, shall have the responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day administration of this chapter and franchise agreements. The city manager shall be empowered to take all administrative actions on behalf of the city, except for those actions specified in this chapter that are reserved to the city council. The city manager may recommend that the council take certain actions with respect to the franchise. The city manager shall keep the council apprised of developments in cable and provide the council with assistance, advice and recommendations as appropriate. 
(b)  Subject to federal and state law, the city council shall have the sole authority to regulate rates for cable services, grant franchises, authorize the entering into of franchise agreements, modify franchise agreements, renew or deny renewal of franchises, revoke franchises, and authorize the transfer of a franchise. 
Sec. 30-31. - Force majeure. 
    In the event a franchisee's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this chapter or the franchisee's franchise agreement is prevented by a cause or event not within the franchisee's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties, fines or sanctions shall be imposed as a result provided, however, that franchisee uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this chapter and any franchise agreement granted or renewed, causes or events not within a franchisee's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, terrorism, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court. Causes or events within franchisee's control, and thus not falling within this section, shall include, without limitation, franchisee's financial ability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of franchisee's directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents. 
Sec. 30-32. - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall be applicable to all cable franchises granted or renewed after the effective date hereof, and shall apply to all cable franchises granted prior to the effective date of this chapter, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by applicable law. 
Sec. 30-33. - Municipal cable system ownership authorized. 
(a)  To the full extent permitted by law, the city may acquire, construct, own, or operate a cable system. 
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit in any way the ability or authority of the city to acquire, construct, own, or operate a cable system to the full extent permitted by law. 
Sec. 30-34. - Reservation of rights. 
(a)  The city reserves the right to amend this chapter as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers. 
(b)  Any additional regulations adopted by the city shall be incorporated into this chapter and complied with by all franchisees within thirty (30) days of the date of adoption of such additional regulations unless imposition of such regulations would be inconsistent with a franchise agreement or would materially alter the obligations of a franchisee or if otherwise prohibited by applicable law or the regulation provides for a longer time to comply. 
(c)  The city reserves the right to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire the property of franchisee's cable system, consistent with applicable federal and state law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this section shall not enlarge or restrict the city's exercise of eminent domain except to the extent provided by applicable law. 
(d)  The city shall at all times have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, with a representative of the franchisee present, to examine a franchisee's records and to inspect a franchisee's facilities to the extent needed to monitor a franchisee's compliance with and performance under this chapter and the franchise agreement.

ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sec. 1-101. - Title.
This code shall be known as and referred to as the "Land Development Regulations (LDRs) of the City of
North Miami, Florida."
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 1-102. - Authority.
These LDRs are enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of F.S. § 163.3161 et seq.
(Community Planning Act), the Charter of the City of North Miami (the City), and the powers and
authority in F.S. chs. 60, 162, 166, 171, 177, 286 and 823.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 1-103. - Purpose of LDRs.
The purpose of these LDRs is to implement the comprehensive land use plan of the City; to establish
comprehensive controls for the use of land in the City of North Miami; to protect, promote and improve
the public health, safety, comfort, order, appearance, convenience, morals and general welfare and
quality of life in the City of North Miami; to establish rules of procedure for land development approvals;
to enhance the character of the City and the preservation of neighborhoods.
It is the further purpose of these LDRs to provide for efficient and appropriate use of land; for
preservation, protection, development and conservation of the natural resources of land, water and air;
for convenient circulation of traffic, people and goods; the proper use and occupancy of buildings; for
healthful distribution of the population; for adequate public facilities and utilities; for promotion of civic
amenities of beauty and visual interest.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 1-104. - Jurisdiction and applicability.
These LDRs shall govern the development and use of land and structures within the corporate limits of
the City. No building, structure, water or land shall be used or occupied, and no building, structure, or
11/10/2019 Print
2/463
land shall be developed unless in conformity with all of the provisions of the land use district in which it
is located, all applicable regulations, and all development approvals.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 1-105. - Comprehensive plan and future land use map.
The comprehensive plan of the City of North Miami along with the future land use map, which is part of
the plan is the official statement of policy of the City in regard to the use of land, and all use or
development of land undertaken pursuant to these LDRs shall be consistent with the comprehensive
plan.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 1-106. - Official zoning map.
A. Map established. The official zoning map is established and incorporated into the LDRs by this
reference. The official zoning map shows the boundaries of all zoning districts as adopted by the city
council pursuant to the procedures of these LDRs. The official zoning map, as amended from time to
time, shall be kept on file and made available for public reference in the community planning and
development department.
B. Interpretation of boundaries.
1. Designation of zoning district boundaries. The district boundary lines are intended generally to
follow the centerlines of streets, the centerlines of railroad rights-of-way, existing lot lines, the mean
water level of streams and other waterways, or municipal boundary lines, all as shown on the official
zoning map. Where a district boundary line does not follow such a line, its position is shown on said
zoning map by a specific dimension expressing its distance in feet from a street centerline or other
boundary line as indicated.
2. Determination of locations of boundaries. In the case of uncertainty as to the true location of a
district boundary line in a particular instance, the community planning and development department
shall request the board of adjustment to render its determination with respect thereto; provided,
however, that no boundary shall be changed by the board of adjustment. All boundary changes shall be
made by the city council in accordance with the provisions of article 3, division 10.

3. Annexed land, reclaimed lands or lands resulting from changed mean high water mark. All lands
which come into existence as a result of reclaiming, or reestablishment of the mean high water mark or
become part of the City of North Miami and under its jurisdiction through dissolution of other
governmental units shall automatically be zoned R-1 until the properties designation on the citys land
use plan and zoning maps can be amended in accordance with the procedures in these LDRs. Said lands
will, within thirty (30) days of such action, be reviewed by the city staff for designation of an appropriate
zoning district and land use plan category, in accordance with the provisions of article 3, divisions 10
and 11.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Note Ordinances amending the official zoning map are as follows: Ord. No. 1297, § 1, 5-25-10; Ord. No.
1342, § 1, 10-23-12; Ord. No. 1351, § 1, 2-26-13; Ord. No. 1364, § 1, 12-10-13; Ord. No. 1366, § 1, 2-11-14
Sec. 1-107. - Transitional rules.
A. Transition period. Where a complete application for development approval is pending on the date of
adoption of these LDRs, or prior to amendment thereto, the provisions of the regulations in effect when
the application was filed shall govern the review and approval of the application for development
approval, provided that:
1. The application is approved within nine (9) months of the date of adoption of or amendment to
these LDRs; and
2. Construction begins within eighteen (18) months of the issuance of such approval and the building
permits remain in effect without lapse through completion.
B. Existing unlawful uses and structures. A structure or use not lawfully existing at the time of the
adoption of these LDRs is deemed lawful only if it conforms to all of the requirements of these LDRs.
C. Existing approved uses. An existing use, which is lawful on the date of adoption of these LDRs,
whether permitted as a permitted use, a conditional use permit, or a special exception in the district"
class="autolink">zoning district in which it is located, shall not be deemed nonconforming solely
because the procedure for approval has been changed through the adoption of these LDRs and shall
hereafter be deemed permitted as of right, as a conditional use permit, or as a special exception use in
the district in which it is located. In the event the use was approved subject to one (1) or more
conditions, those conditions shall continue in full force and effect unless a new approval is obtained,
which otherwise nullifies those conditions. If the existing use is nonconforming under either the prior
11/10/2019 Print
4/463
zoning code or these LDRs, then such use shall come into conformance with these LDRs if required by
the provisions of article 6.
D. Previously granted variances.

Sec. 3-216. - Unity of title; covenant in lieu thereof.
A. The term unified development site shall be defined as a site where a development is proposed and
consists of multiple lots, all lots touching and not separated by a lot under different ownership, or a
public right of way. A unified development site does not include any lots separated by a public right-ofway
or any non-adjacent, non-contiguous parcels. All applications for building permits where buildings
and/or improvements are proposed for a single lot, or where building(s) are proposed for a unified
development site, shall be accompanied by one of the following documents:
1. Unity of Title. A unity of title shall be utilized when there is solely one owner of the entire unified
development site. The unity of title, approved for legal form and sufficiency by the city attorney, shall run
with the land and be binding upon the owners heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns,
and upon all mortgagees or lessees and others presently or in the future having any interest in the
property; or
2. Covenant in Lieu of Unity of Title. A covenant in lieu of unity of title or a declaration of restrictive
covenants, shall be utilized when the unified development site is owned, or is proposed for multiple

their successors, whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, execute or consent to the
application for modification.
2. The director of the citys community planning and development department shall review the
application and determine whether the request is for a minor or substantial modification. If the request
is a minor modification, the modification may be approved administratively by the director. If the
modification is substantial, the request will be reviewed by the DRC, after public hearing. This application
shall be in addition to all other required approvals necessary for the modification sought. A minor
modification would not generate excessive noise or traffic; tend to create a fire or other equally or
greater dangerous; provoke excessive overcrowding of people; tend to provide a nuisance; nor be
incompatible with the area concerned when considering the necessity and reasonableness of the
modification in relation to the present and future development of the area concerned. A substantial
modification may also include a request to modify the uses on the unified development site, the
operation, physical condition or site plan. Substantial modifications shall be required to return to the

other parties unless and until the owner and such other party or parties shall have executed and
mutually delivered, in recordable form, an instrument to be known as an easement and operating
agreement which shall include, but not be limited to:

10. Appropriate reservation of rights to grant easements to utility companies;
11. Appropriate reservation of rights to road right-of-ways and curb cuts;

the community planning and development director may require, all to the end that although the property
may have several owners, it will be constructed, conveyed, maintained and operated in accordance with
the approved site plan. The community planning and development department shall treat the unified site
as one site under these land development regulations, regardless of separate ownerships. These
provisions or portions thereof may be waived by the director if they are not applicable to the subject
property (such as for conveyances to purchases of individual condominium units). These provisions of
the easement and operating agreement shall not be amended without prior written approval of the city
attorney.

11/10/2019 Print
51/463
A. Purpose. The purpose of providing for conditional uses is to recognize that there are uses which may
have beneficial effects and serve important public interests, but which may, but not necessarily, have
adverse effects on the environment, overburden public services or change the desired character of an
area. Conditional uses are permitted uses in a particular zoning district that require individualized review
due to the potential individual or cumulative impacts that they may have on the surrounding area or
neighborhood. The review process allows the imposition of conditions to mitigate identified concerns or
to deny the use if concerns cannot be resolved.
B. Applicability. With the exception of applications in the PCUD, conditional use approval is the
mechanism for approval of all planned development district applications, for allocating units in the NRO
district, for approval of PU applications, and approval of density and height bonuses in article 4, division
4, section 4-404.

Sec. 3-801. - Purpose and applicability.
11/10/2019 Print
72/463
The purpose of this division is to provide application and review procedures for the subdivision of land
within the city. This division shall be applicable to any subdivision or re-subdivision of land that creates
one (1) or more parcels. No building permit shall be issued for construction of any improvements on a
parcel that was not legally created in compliance with these LDRs.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)
Sec. 3-802. - Plats and platting, recording; exceptions.
Whenever land is subdivided a plat must be recorded, except that the recording of a plat will not be
required if:
A. The subdivision involved consists only of the dedication of a road, highway, street, alley or easement,
and due to unusual conditions and circumstances, the community planning and development director
finds that it is not necessary that a plat be recorded. In lieu of the recording of a plat, the dedication may
be required by deed, and may be subject to compliance with such conditions the community planning
and development director deems appropriate under the particular circumstances, such as improvements
of sidewalks, streets, or drainage facilities and the acceptance of the dedication by the governing body.
Posting of bond or other surety acceptable to the city may be required.
B. The land to be subdivided is to be divided into no more than six lots, and because of:
1. Unusual conditions created by ownership or development of adjacent lands;
2. The isolation or remoteness of the land concerned in relation to other platted or improved lands; or
3. Improvements and dedications existing on the land substantially in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter, the community planning and development director determines that waiving
the requirement for platting would not conflict with the purpose and intent of this article.
C. In lieu of platting, the community planning and development director may require any dedications,
reservations, or improvements required in connection with platting under this article, including the
posting of a performance and maintenance bond, as may be necessary to carry out the intent and
purpose of this chapter.
D. The community planning and development director determines that resubdivision of land heretofore
platted is of such unusual size or shape, or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions to
justify the waiving of the requirement for recording a plat. In lieu of the recording of a plat, such
11/10/2019 Print

conditions may be imposed as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to preserve the public
interest.

11/10/2019 Print
102/463
A. The approval process for new street names shall be administered during the tentative plat, or plan
review. Street names are required to be submitted for each new street, whether the street is to be
dedicated to public use, a private street, or an ingress/egress easement that meets the criteria stated
below. Plats or plans submitted without street names, or with generic names, such as Street A, are to
be rejected and returned to the developer/design engineer until compliance with the requirements for
labeling street names is achieved. The approved street names will appear on all subsequent
submissions of plats or plans for review by the city.
B. The following streets or traveled ways require city approved street names:
1. Federal and primary state highways.
2. Street proposed for acceptance into the secondary state highway system - dedicated to public use.
3. Private streets to be maintained by homeowners association or other private firm or organization.
4. Ingress/egress easements that serve more than one address.
C. New street names may be required when an insufficient number of addresses remain on an existing
street for addressing new townhouse, condominium, apartment, or retail developments. In such cases,
the access entrance to the development from the existing street is to be named, with addresses
assigned to the named entrance and traveled way.
D. Tentative reservation of street names.
1. Tentative approval. Developers and engineers may receive tentative approval of street names by
reserving the names with the community planning and development department. By reserving a
proposed street name, the city has not formally approved the street name for use, but has given
conditional approval, subject to formal review during the tentative plat or plan review process. The
community planning and development department reserves the right to disallow use of tentatively
approved street names upon formal plat or plan review.
2. Two-year reservation. Proposed street names may be tentatively reserved for two (2) years only.
After expiration of the two-year reservation, if plats or plans showing such reserved names have not
been submitted to the city by the developer reserving the name, the name may be used by any other
developer in the city.
E. Duplication of existing street names. No duplication of existing street names is to occur within the
city. Street names with the same name, but different street type designations will be considered
duplicate street names and will not receive approval with the exception of cul-de-sacs that intersect
11/10/2019 Print
103/463
directly with a street of the same name. To ensure that street names are not duplicated, proposed street
names will be reviewed against the city address system as the primary source for existing street names.
F. Near spelling duplications, confusing spellings, phonetically similar names. Near duplications in
spelling, confusing spellings, or names that are phonetically similar to existing names are not to be
approved. Near duplications of spelling are to be identified by reviewing the city address system.
Confusing spellings include those names that are difficult to spell, obscure names, or twists on
conventional spelling of familiar names. Proper names are not to be approved, except for special
recognition as approved by the city council, nor will the names of commercial establishments be utilized.
G. Length of street names. New street names will not contain more than 16 characters, not including the
type designation. Names shall not contain hyphens, apostrophes, nor any other non-letter characters.
Street names will not consist of more than two words, exclusive of street type.
H. Continuation of street names. Streets continuing through an intersection will keep the same name.
Exceptions may be granted if the street crosses a major arterial road. Commercial, multifamily, or
townhouse developments having an entrance or access through a publicly maintained cul-de-sac are to
have a separate street name for the entrance or access road in the event that it serves or is intended to
serve more than one (1) address.
1. Cul-de-sacs directly opposite each other, intersecting with a common street are to have different
names.
2. Street names will not change due to a change in direction of the street, nor will a new prefix be used
for those streets that meet the criteria for using compass points in the street name.
I. Use of compass points in street names. Compass points, such as north or west, shall not be used as a
part of a street name, including as a prefix or suffix except as follows:
1. Where streets cross the east/west or north/south zero baseline for address assignment, with no
change in base name and type, compass points shall be used to ensure that the correct portion of such
streets is correctly identified. For those streets that meet the criterion for this exception, the compass
point direction is to made part of the official name of that street.
2. Where a street is constructed in stages from two ends and does not connect, compass points may
be used until the street is physically connected. At that time, any such prefixes will be removed from the
official street names. This process is to be automatic and is the responsibility of the planning and zoning
department.

104/463
Sec. 3-820. - Street type designations.
Street type designations will be approved or assigned by the community planning and development
department. Street names submitted for review must include street type designations and must be
evaluated. If meeting the criteria for street types, they will be approved. Street types appearing on
tentative, final check subdivision plats, site plans, or the subdivision record plats, which do not meet
criteria shall be noted for change by the developer/design engineer and approvals will be withheld until
such changes are implemented. The following are the criteria for street type designation assignment or

the building may be facing. Addresses will be assigned based on the county-wide grid system, which is a
quadrant grid extended from the City of North Miami.
C. The centerline of N.W. 119th Street shall be taken as the basis of numbering from the south to the
north on a unit basis of 25 feet per address number; and the buildings on the north and south avenues
and thoroughfares, which intersect that street shall begin to be numbered at that street and run north to
the city limits.
D. The centerline of Miami avenue" class="autolink">Avenue shall be taken as the basis of numbering
from the east to the west and from the west to the east on a unit basis of 25 feet per address number;

the streets having the odd numbers and the south and west sides having the even numbers.
F. Address number units in a square shall increase in an arithmetical progression of two as the address
number units recede from the base thoroughfare.
G. The address numbers in the first squares adjoining a base thoroughfare shall begin with one on the
north and east sides and two on the south and west sides, and progress arithmetically by two (2) for
each successive address number unit space from the base thoroughfare, to the next street or avenue.
H. The numbering of address number units in each square shall begin with that hundred number
indicating the number of squares it may be removed from the base thoroughfare, and numbers shall
advance by hundreds only by squares.
I. In case of diagonal streets, avenues or places, or in case of streets, avenues or places which do not
lend themselves to the designation or description of north and south or east and west, the community

road to the property will be used to assign an address. The street address number shall be derived from
the appropriate address on the grid system closest to the center of the property. If, at a later date, a
building permit is applied for on that land-locked parcel and a proper legal right of ingress/egress has
been obtained, the actual location of the ingress/egress will be shown the time of permit application and
the building number adjusted to correspond to the location of the driveway. This information is to be
entered and stored, with ancillary data, in the automated city address system.
F. Addressing commercial, office, and warehouse developments. Assignment of addresses for shopping
centers will vary depending on whether it is a strip center or mall. Commercial developments with
variable retail space are to be evaluated for addressing based upon the minimum frontage and the
maximum potential number of units. The requirements for addressing office and variable warehouse are
11/10/2019 Print
111/463
the same as for strip shopping centers. Finalized assigned address information is to be entered and
stored, with ancillary data, in the automated city address system.
1. Strip shopping centers, variable office and warehouse spaces. Strip shopping centers are to have an
individual address for the center itself and each unit shall be addressed in the manner prescribed for
townhouses. Strict adherence to the 25-foot frontage dimension shall be followed. Site development
plans for all strip shopping centers shall be required to include the maximum number of potential units
within the center in order that allowances can be made for proper addressing. The location of the door
providing primary public access is the determining factor in address assignment. In the event that a strip
shopping center may require more street addresses than are available within the segment of street, the
community planning and development department may assign one (1) street address to the strip
shopping center as a whole and assign unit numbers for each of the potential units within the center.
Unit numbers shall run as consecutive whole numbers in the same direction as the addresses on the
street. Unit numbers shall begin with 101 and progress higher. The same procedures and information are
to be used in assigning addresses and unit numbers to variable office and warehouse spaces.
2. Enclosed shopping malls. Enclosed shopping malls are to be addressed with one street address
number assigned to the street intersecting with the main entrance. Separate address numbers are not to
be assigned to each entrance of enclosed shopping malls. The maximum number of retail units is to be
included on the site development plans as well as the minimum retail unit frontage. Unit numbers are to
be assigned using an odd and even numbers distribution on either side of the mall corridor. Unit
numbers will begin with 1001 on the odd side and 1002 on the even side. In malls having multiple
corridors and/or levels, each corridor is to be assigned numbers in higher hundreds of divisions within a
range of 1001 to 1999. Additional levels shall be numbered similarly within the next highest thousands
range. For example, retail spaces in one corridor may run from 1001 to 1028, retail spaces in an
adjoining corridor would resume the sequence and run from 1029 to 1046, and stores on the next level
up would be numbered 2001 to 2028 and 2029 to 2046, respectively.
3. Office parks. Office park address assignment shall be in accordance with the established address
grid system. Each building will be numbered as with townhouses with each exterior entrance receiving a
separate address.
G. Addressing multifamily dwellings and multi-unit office building types. These requirements include
residential and office buildings of the same type construction design as apartment buildings.
1. Multifamily housing units, such as apartments and condominiums, are to have a separate street
address for each entry providing primary access to units within the building, as defined by the
development plans. Street addresses are to be assigned based on the established criteria for
assignment in accordance with the grid system and using an appropriate odd and even scheme for
11/10/2019 Print
112/463
building entrance. Finalized assigned address information is to be entered and stored, with ancillary
data, in the automated city address system.
2. Plans for multifamily dwellings, such as apartments and condominiums, to include conversions, and
multi-unit office building types shall have unit numbers assigned by the community planning and
development department in conjunction with the grid based street address. Plans submitted for review
and address assignment must clearly identify the location of all entrances to each building and each unit
therein and depict the physical relationships between these entrances.
3. Within vertical, multi-level structures, a consecutive whole unit number shall be assigned for each
separate unit. Numbers shall be assigned from left to right as viewed from the common primary
entrance. The lowest floor shall begin with 101 and progress in increments of one (102, 103, 104, etc.),
until all units on that level have been assigned unit numbers. Unit numbers on successively higher floors
are to be incremented by 100, such as 201, 202, 203, for the second level, 301, 302, 303, for the third
floor and so on. The official complete street address for each unit will consist of the building number,
street name, street type, and unit number in accordance with United States Postal Service regulations.
4. The submitted site development plans, or condominium plats, must include a top view schematic of
the buildings in their proper relationship to the streets providing access, as well as an elevation view or
perspective diagram showing the relationship of unit entrances to the entry providing primary access
from the exterior of the building. Final approval of plans will not be granted until the developer/design
engineer has provided the community planning and development department with information suitable
for assigning addresses for these types of structures.
Sec. 3-824. - Building numbers specifications.
Numbers on buildings shall conform to the following specifications.
A. Address numbers for single-family, townhouses, and multifamily dwellings.
1. Size. The numbers shall have a minimum height of four (4) inches. It is recommended that the
height of the numbers exceed four inches.
2. Location. All numbers shall be securely mounted on the building front, or any fixed accessory
located in front of the building within five (5) feet of the main entry way or main path of travel which
leads to the main entrance of the said building from a public or private road. Such numbers shall
otherwise be separately mounted in the same manner upon the face of a wall or fence or upon a post in
the front yard of the property. Whenever a building is more than 50 feet from the street, or when the
primary access doorway is not clearly visible from the street, the number is to be placed on appropriate
11/10/2019 Print
113/463
signage at the street end of the driveway or other street access point and will be visible from both
directions of street approach. Placement of numbers on a roadside mailbox, conforming to size
requirements, in such cases, will be acceptable.
B. Address numbers for commercial, office, and warehouse facilities.
1. Size. Numbers will be not less than ten (10) inches in height.
2. Location. Numbering shall be placed above the exterior primary access entrance. In the event that a
strip shopping center, variable office structure, or warehouse structure has had unit numbers assigned,
unit numbers shall be posted in a like manner as well and will, also, be not less than ten (10) inches in
height.
3. Numbering on signage. Commercial properties such as, but not limited to, strip shopping centers,
shopping malls, and office parks, displaying approved identifying signage will display an address number
on that signage. In the case of shopping malls, the number shall be the actual number of the malls
address. In the case of strip shopping centers, shall be the lowest number of all numbers assigned to
the facility. Numbers displayed on signage shall not be less than ten inches in height and may be placed
above or below the signage and attached to that signage. Numbers must be clearly visible from the
street.
C. Addressing of vacant parcels. Each vacant parcel outside of a subdivision shall have an address
assigned using the lowest number available across the road frontage of the parcel. If, at a later date, a
building permit is applied for on that parcel, the actual location of the driveway entrance shall be shown
the time of permit application and the building number adjusted to correspond to the location of the
driveway. This information is to be entered and stored, with ancillary data, in the automated city address
system.
D. Addressing land locked parcels. Land-locked pieces of property shall be addressed from the nearest
road unless there is a major creek or stream between the nearest road and the property and the property
lies in its entirety on the far side of the creek or stream from the road. In such cases, the next adjacent
road to the property shall be used to assign an address. The street address number shall be derived
from the appropriate address on the grid system closest to the center of the property. If, at a later date, a
building permit is applied for on that land locked parcel and a proper legal right of ingress/egress has
been obtained, the actual location of the ingress/egress shall be shown the time of permit application
and the building number adjusted to correspond to the location of the driveway. This information is to be
entered and stored, with ancillary data, in the automated city address system.
E. Additional requirements.
11/10/2019 Print
114/463
1. Legibility. Numbers shall be sufficiently legible as to contrasting background, arrangement, size,
spacing, and uniformity of numerals, so that the numbers may be read with ease during daylight hours
by a person possessing at least 20/40 vision upon viewing said numbers from the center line of the
adjacent road. The numbers shall be placed such that trees, shrubs, and other obstructions do not block
the line of sight of the numbers from the centerline of the adjacent road.
2. Proximity to light source. Wherever practicable and in accordance with these LDRs, the building
numbers shall be placed as close as possible to a light source, in order to make them more visible at
night. If no light source is in proximity, the numbers shall be made of a reflective material.
3. Adjusting and specifying numbers. Such numbers shall not be changed without the consent of the
community planning and development department director; and it shall be the duty of the community
planning and development department director to adjust such numbers, or to number such streets from
time to time, if such numbering may be required.
4. Plats on file. For the purpose of facilitating a correct enumeration, plats of all streets, avenues,
courts, terraces and highways within the city, showing the proper number of all lots or houses fronting
upon all thoroughfares (except alleys) shall be prepared and kept on file in the office of the city clerk,
which plats shall be available during regular office hours, for public inspection.
5. Placement by owner or occupant. It shall be a violation of these LDRs for any owner or occupant of
any building to fail to number or renumber such building in conformity with the provisions set forth
herein, and with the plan for numbering buildings, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice
from the community planning and development department director of the proper number of such
building. Such violation shall be subject to the imposition of a monetary fine that may be collected in the
same manner and with the same penalties as violations for failure to pay city taxes.
Sec. 3-825. - Authority for changing building numbers.
The community planning and development department director shall have the authority to change the
numbering of any existing or new address upon determining that such change is a necessity based on
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry. The community planning and development department
director shall determine appropriate new address numbers to supplant those to be changed. The
community planning and development director shall notify the owners of the property by mail as to the
impending change. In all cases, changes shall become effective not less than 60 days subsequent to the

G. All building numbers as herein provided shall be maintained in good condition.
H. Failure by any owner of a building to number, renumber, maintain such building address numbers, or
use any number other than that assigned by the community planning and development department
constitutes a violation of this chapter, which may result in the imposition of a monetary fine that may be
collected in the same manner and with the same penalties as violations for failure to pay city taxes. The
city shall not issue any building permit until the official building number has been issued, nor shall the
city issue any certificate of occupancy until permanent and proper address numbers have been affixed
to the structure in accordance with this article.

DIVISION 14. - NEW DEVELOPMENT; IMPACT FEES
Sec. 3-1401. - Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited to as the City of North Miami Development Impact Fees
Act.
(Ord. No. 1302, § 2, 9-15-10)
11/10/2019 Print
143/463
Sec. 3-1402. - Findings.
A. The city council hereby finds and declares that:
1. New development generates increased demands upon city public facilities and services and
requires additional facility capacity and capital equipment in order to accommodate those demands.
2. The potential for development of properties is a direct result of city policy as expressed in the city
comprehensive plan and as implemented via the city zoning ordinances and map.
3. It is the policy of the city that new development should bear its fair share of the costs of providing
public facilities, facility capacity, increased services and capital equipment needed to accommodate the
demand generated by new development.
4. The amount of the "impact fee" to be imposed shall be based upon the average amount of the public
facility capacity demand attributable to new development and the average cost of additional capital
facilities, capital improvements, services and capital equipment needed to provide additional capacity.
5. The impact fees established in this article are applicable to development submitting building permit
applications accepted as complete by the city on or after October 1, 2010 and are based on the
methodology and data presented in the Impact Fees Study prepared by TischlerBise, Fiscal, Economic
and Planning Consultants, dated April 17, 2007, (hereinafter referred to as impact fees study2007).
The city council hereby adopts and incorporates by reference the impact fees study2007. A copy of the
impact fees study2007 was submitted as a part of the record of the public hearings on the ordinance,
and a copy of the impact fees study2007 shall be maintained on file in the office of the city clerk.
B. The city council hereby finds and declares that the impact fees imposed herein upon new
development as further described below, in order to finance public facilities and capital equipment
needed to accommodate the demand created by new development are in the best interest of the city
and its residents, are equitable, and do not impose an unfair burden on such development. The city
council hereby finds and declares that all new development, as defined herein, within the city generates
an increased demand for system improvements for police, general government, and water/sewer and
that all new residential development within the city also generates an increased demand for parks and
recreation facilities, library facilities and transportation. The city council hereby finds and declares that
the system improvements to be funded by the impact fees imposed herein will provide benefit to all new
development in the city.

144/463
Sec. 3-1403. - Intent.
This chapter is intended to impose impact fees, payable at the time of building permit issuance, in order
to fund capital improvements, capital facility capacity, and capital equipment needed to address demand
for public facilities attributable to new development. This chapter is not intended to authorize imposition
of fees related to capital facility or equipment needs attributable to existing development. This chapter is
intended to allow new development in compliance with the comprehensive plan and to provide a
mechanism for new development to help address the burdens created by new development.
(Ord. No. 1302, § 4, 9-15-10)
Sec. 3-1404. - Authority.
The city council is authorized to establish and adopt an impact fees act pursuant to the authority
granted by the Florida Constitution, article VII, sections 1(f), 1(g) and 2(b), the Municipal Home Rule
Powers Act, F.S. Ch. 166, as amended, the City of North Miami Charter, and the Community Planning Act,
as amended. In addition, the Community Planning Act, as amended, encourages the use of innovative

(collectively referred to as city entities) submitting a petition shall not be required to pay said fee.
2. All petitions shall be submitted to the city manager's office for processing and preparation of a staff
report and recommendation on the petition, and the final determination on the petition shall be issued at
the reasonable discretion of the city manager. The city manager's office may obtain an analysis of the

and detailed review of and recommendation on the petition request to the city manager. The staff report
and recommendations shall be forwarded to the city manager no later than sixty (60) days after filing of
a completed petition. The city manager shall, no later than ninety (90) days of filing of the complete
petition issue a written determination on the petition, with the reasoning for the determination based

upon the petition data, the provisions of this chapter and applicable law, and, if needed, direct the
appropriate city staff to take the actions necessary to implement the determination. The petitioner shall
demonstrate the following:

has been approved subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the
impacts of the development occur; or
b. The necessary facilities are under construction concurrently with the development; or
c. The necessary facilities are the subject of a binding contract executed for the construction of
those necessary facilities at the time a city development permit is issued or at the discretion of the city
manager; or

professionals are needed. If the city manager's designee determines that the petition is not complete, a
written statement detailing the insufficiencies of the petition shall be provided to the petitioner within
thirty (30) days of initial filing of the petition. The date of such written determination of insufficiency
shall toll the time limits established in the section until submittal of a complete petition. Any
insufficiency not corrected during such time will cause the petition to not be considered, and it will be
returned without the necessity of further action.
4. The filing of a petition shall stay action by the city on the application for building permit and any
other city action related to the development. No building permit shall be issued for development for
which a petition has been filed and is pending unless the total impact fees due have been paid in full or a

fees if the city has failed to appropriate or spend the collected fees by the end of the calendar quarter
immediately following, five (5) years of the date of payment of the impact fee, if the building permit for
which the impact fee has been paid has lapsed for non-commencement of construction, if the project for
which a building permit has been issued has been altered resulting in a decrease in the amount of the
impact fee due.
2. Only the current owner of property may petition for a refund. A petition for refund must be filed
within ninety (90) days of any of the above-specific events giving rise to the right to claim a refund.

budgeted for that system improvement or the amount of the impact fees for the same type of system
improvements that are due from the development requesting the credit whichever amount is smaller. If
the impact fees exceed the amount of credit granted, at the time of issuance of the building permit, the

The purpose of this division is to regulate the location of adult entertainment businesses so as to
prevent the adverse secondary effects on the public health, safety, and welfare, which, are "caused by the
presence of even one (1) such establishment." This section is designed to eliminate or lessen such
adverse secondary effects by preventing or lessening the concentration of such adult entertainment
businesses by maintaining minimum distances between such adult entertainment businesses and
between certain other uses, and allowing adult entertainment businesses to locate in appropriate areas
only. This section is based upon the fundamental zoning principle that certain uses, by the very nature of
the adverse secondary effects such uses are recognized to have upon the surrounding community, must
be subjected to particular restrictions so that such uses may exist without destroying the vitality of
existence of other lawful and reasonable uses. The sole purpose of the legislative body of the city in
enacting this section is the desire to preserve and protect the quality of life, public health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the city, and not to suppress free speech or impair the constitutional
rights of any person. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize a commission of any obscenity

material in the landscape;
10. Promoting the use of trees and shrubs for energy conservation by encouraging cooling through the
provision of shade and channeling of breeze;
11. Contributing to the processes of air movement, air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater
recharge, and stormwater runoff retention, while aiding in the abatement of noise, glare, heat, air
pollution and dust generated by major roadways and intense use areas;
12. Improving the aesthetic appearance of commercial, industrial, and residential development through
the use of appropriate landscaping, thereby protecting and increasing property values within the
community, and protecting designated historic landscapes;
13. Reducing the negative impacts of exotic pest plant species and prohibiting the use of noxious
exotic plants, which may be harmful to native plant communities;
14. Promoting the use of trees to protect structures from the effects of high winds; and

spacing of thirty (30) inches on center, or, if planted at a minimum height of 36 inches, shall have a
maximum average spacing of forty-eight (48) inches on center, and shall be maintained so as to form a
continuous, unbroken and solid visual screen within one (1) year after time of planting, except
penetrated only at approved points for ingress or egress to the property. Shrubs used as a buffer, visual
screen, or hedge need not be of the same species;
5. The height of any hedge shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height;
6. Hedges may be placed on the property lines; however, this regulation shall not be construed to

D. Bioswales. The following standards shall be considered minimum requirements unless otherwise
indicated:
1. In general.
11/10/2019 Print
277/463
a. A bioswale is a conventional ditch or swale, modified and planted with deep rooted native and
Florida Friendly plants that increase water percolation and pollutant removal as stormwater flows
through it. Bioswales shall be composed of a combination of low growing plants that can survive wet
and dry conditions over extended periods of time.
b. Bio-swales shall be designed to maximize the perimeter dimension, where feasible;
c. Bio-swales shall be planted throughout with native herbaceous facultative plants, with the
following exceptions:
d. In areas that are actively used for play, overflow parking, or sports shall be planted with grasses
which are very drought tolerant as well as tolerant to wet soils
e. The minimum required number of native herbaceous facultative plants shall be one (1) plant per
square foot of retention/detention area, including the slope. Minimum required herbaceous plant
container size shall be one and one-half (1 ½) inches, commonly referred to as a liner. Sprigging,
seeding, plugging, hydro-mulching or sodding with native herbaceous facultative plants grown from local
seed sources may be used in lieu of liners. Herbaceous plants shall be planted in such a manner as to
present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage within one (1) year after planting.
f. Native facultative trees or shrubs may be used in lieu of native herbaceous facultative plants,
provided that the minimum required stormwater retention capacity is not adversely affected.
2. Swale Composition.
Swale shall mean a natural or manmade trench that:
a. Has a top width-to-depth ratio of the cross-section equal to or greater than 6:1, or side slopes
equal to or greater than four (4) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical; and
b. Contains contiguous areas of standing or flowing water only following a rainfall event; and
c. Is planted with or has stabilized vegetation suitable for soil stabilization, surface water treatment,
and nutrient uptake; and
d. Is designed to take into account the soil erodibility, soil percolation, slope, slope length, and
drainage area so as to prevent erosion and reduce pollutant concentration of any Stormwater as defined
in of the Miami-Dade County Water Quality Standards.
e. Swale shall be mulched at all times and shall have a 12 minimum sad boarder around the
bioswale area to create a boarder for the swale.
11/10/2019 Print
278/463
f. Vegetation in the swale shall not exceed over 30 inches in overall height above the driveway
elevation.
g. Wet detention shall mean water storage with the bottom elevation lower than one (1) foot below
the control elevation of the system.
3. Design Considerations: Bioswales must be functional, maintainable and attractive to ensure longterm
success. While similar in design, bioswales are more linear than bioretention areas or rain gardens,
and are designed for conveyance. Only shallow slopes are effective. Steep slopes result in rapid travel
and less filtration. Check for or consider installing dams that may enhance pollutant removal. They are
primarily used for small sites and may not be effective on larger sites. Choosing the proper landscaping
is critical to the performance of a bioswale: Select native vegetation with deep root structures. Select
species that withstand the frequent and substantial water flow. Plants that can tolerate both wet and dry
conditions may work best. Consider the flow path to maximize conveyance. Bioswales may be more
linear or curvaceous, depending on site characteristics. Design the planting layout to allow for easy
access and to facilitate periodic removal of sediments without significant disruption or removal of plant
materials. A lack of consideration for these details can lead to failed plantings and site flooding.
4. Standard of Maintenance.
a. Swale areas will be considered maintained if all of the following requirements are met:
(1) Areas must be kept free from any accumulation of debris, litter, decayed vegetable matter, filth,
rubbish, trash, discarded building materials, glass, or any other materials which are dangerous to the
public health, safety and welfare;
(2) Areas must not be allowed to become overgrown with untended vegetation.
b. Sodding of the swale area shall be permitted. All such sodded areas shall be kept in good
condition. The paving of any swale shall be prohibited.
c. The placement of swings or similar apparatus on trees located in the swale area shall be
prohibited.
d. Owner shall only permit parking of motor vehicles in swale area if it does not damage the sod or
paved material on the swale.
e. Swale areas, which are not maintained in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section
are hereby declared to be nuisances; detrimental and dangerous to the public health, safety and welfare.
Any violation of this section may be subject to landscape mitigation and/or penalties.
11/10/2019 Print
279/463
5. Plans required. Any person wanting to install a bioswale either on their property or on an adjacent
public right-of-way shall apply for a landscape permit (for which no fees shall be charged) with the
community planning and development department. The permit application shall be accompanied by a
site plan and a cut section drawn to scale no smaller than one (1) inch equals sixteen (16) feet indicating
size, location, composition, drainage and plant type installed in the swale. Said permit shall be reviewed
by both the citys public works department and community planning and development department for
engineering and plant types, respectively.
E. Prohibitions.
1. Prohibited plant species. Prohibited species shall not be planted and shall be removed from any site
which is subject to the requirements of this division.
2. Controlled plant species. Controlled species shall not be planted within five hundred (500) feet of a
Natural Forest Community or native habitats as defined herein.
3. West Indian Mahogany. West Indian Mahogany, Swietenia mahagoni, shall not be planted within five
hundred (500) feet of a rockland hammock or pine rockland.
4. Tree abuse. Tree abuse is prohibited. Abused trees shall not be counted toward fulfilling the
minimum tree requirements.

responsibilities for costs incurred to obtain access to the easement area (which may include removal of
the fence, wall or other similar structures) and the property owner shall be responsible for the full
restoration of the area - all at property owners sole cost. Such letter shall hold harmless the city, its
officials and agents, as well as all other officials or agents of governmental agencies and public utilities,
or any private party interest having a right of access to such easement.
H. Chainlink fence prohibited in all districts front yards, side yards and side street yards. Notwithstanding
anything in the LDRs to the contrary, chain link fences shall be permitted only behind the rear building
line, and shall not be permitted along property lines abutting side streets or on through (double frontage)
lots. It is provided, however, that the aforementioned restriction on chain link fences shall not apply in
the M-1 district.
I. Wall or fence required between dissimilar land uses. Where dissimilar land uses abut to or are adjacent
to each other, a six-foot-high wall or fence meeting the approval of the community planning and
development director shall be provided along common property lines, except for dissimilar land uses
that are separated by a right-of-way. Where an adjacent or abutting property is undeveloped land, said
wall shall be not be required until such time the unimproved land is developed. In this event, the
requirement of the wall shall be borne by the developer of the unimproved land.
J. Height between different districts. Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the contrary, where
an R-1 or R-2 district abuts another district, a fence, wall or hedge on the R-1 or R-2 property may be

with stucco and paint. Each side of a decorative masonry wall shall be completely painted. If a wall is to
be placed on a shared property line, consent for access must be obtained from the adjoining property
owner prior to finishing the opposite side of the wall. If such consent cannot be obtained, the property
owner erecting the wall must present proof that a request for access approval was mailed to every
adjacent property owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing addresses as listed in
the most current county tax roll, and the mailing was returned undeliverable or the adjacent property
owners failed to respond to the request within thirty (30) days after receipt. Upon such a showing, the
property owner erecting the wall shall not be required to finish the opposite side of the wall.
M. Measuring height of wall, fence, and hedge. The height of a wall, fence or hedge shall be the vertical
distance measured from the finished grade of the lot or from the average elevation of the finished
building site to the top of the wall, hedge or fence. The average elevation shall be measured along both
sides of the wall, hedge or fence line. Vacant or undeveloped land may not be increased or decreased to
affect the permitted (or required) height of a wall, hedge or fence unless the entire building site is graded
to even out the level of the site or to increase it to the required the city flood criteria elevation. Average
elevation shall be determined by taking elevations along both sides of the wall, hedge or fence line, at
11/10/2019 Print
290/463
five-foot intervals and totaling the same and then dividing the total by the number of stations at which
the elevations were taken. No fence or wall may be placed on any portion of an earthen mound or berm
unless the height of the fence or wall is cumulatively not higher than the allowable height in the zoning
district from the finished grade of the lot. Decorative columns, or other types of architectural features
shall not be measured as the fence or wall height provided said decorative columns or other types of
architectural features do not exceed twenty (20) percent of the permitted height of the fence or wall.
N. Temporary construction fences. All temporary construction fences used at construction or
development sites, may, at the discretion of the community planning and development director, be
exempt from the height, opacity and landscaping provisions of this division, provided that they do not
obstruct the vision of motor vehicle operations, in accordance with the sight triangle provided herein or
create other hazards to public safety.

C. Minimum requirement. The minimum requirement for shared parking is the highest sum among the
five columns resulting from the calculation in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
D. Shared parking shall not result in a reduction of more than 25 percent from the minimum parking
required without shared parking.
E. Parking spaces that are reserved for use by specified individuals, classes of individuals or specified
businesses shall not be counted toward meeting shared parking requirements.
F. Reserved parking for the disabled shall not be counted towards meeting shared parking requirements.

recorded in the county official records. The owners of record shall update the shared parking agreement
to address any change in the uses identified in the agreement which would cause an increase in peak
parking demand, or a finding of any other related change in conditions by the city. The modified
agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the city attorney and the community planning
and development department.

11/10/2019 Print
324/463
A. Noncommercial copy. Any sign authorized in this article may contain noncommercial copy in lieu of
any other copy so long as the sign complies with the size, height, area and other requirements of this
article.
B. Setback. No portion of any sign shall be located within five (5) feet of a property line of a parcel
proposed for development, except as required or permitted by law. Neon signs and lighting.
C. Neon signs and lighting shall be permitted as freestanding and attached signage as provided in this
division. When neon lighting is utilized to emphasize the architectural features of a building, such as
when used to outline doorways, windows, facades, or architectural detailing, or when used to accentuate
site landscaping, it shall not be regarded as signage. In addition, neon lighting used as freestanding
designs or murals or as attached murals or designs unrelated to the architectural features of the building
to which the lighting is attached shall be permitted, but shall be counted toward the allowable area of the
property's or occupancy's freestanding or attached signage, as applicable. No neon sign shall be a
flashing, animated or rotating sign.
D. In areas accessible to or within reach of the general public, exposed neon strings shall be covered
with a clear acrylic cover, or electrode sleeves, or electrode boots. Neon connections must be insulated
with glass or other appropriate material; transformers must be enclosed within transformer cans; and
secondary voltage wires must be insulated with piping.
E. Illuminated signs.

rights-of-way and properties.
2. No sign shall have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other illumination devices which have a
changing light intensity, brightness, or direction. This prohibition shall not include electronic message
centers or indoor electronic scrolling signs operating in conformance with this ordinance.
3. No colored lights shall be used at any location or in any manner so as to be confused with or
construed as traffic-control devices.
4. Neither the direct nor the reflected light from primary light sources shall create a traffic hazard to
operators of motor vehicles on public thoroughfares.
5. The light which illuminates a sign shall be shaded, shielded, or directed so that no structure,
including sign supports or awnings, are illuminated by such lighting.
F. Banners and flags. A banner or flag may be used as a permitted attached sign and, if so used, the area
of the banner or flag shall be included in, and limited by, the computation of allowable area for
11/10/2019 Print

gasoline price display sign shall be counted toward the allowable area for the freestanding sign.
H. Electronic message center. Electronic message center signs shall be allowed in all nonresidential
districts on major corridors and not face local streets. The maximum area for the electronic message
center portion only shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the allowed sign area for monument or
freestanding shopping center sign on which it is placed. The area of an electronic message center sign,
whether attached or freestanding, shall be included in determining the cumulative area of signs on a
property.
1. Such signs shall display static images for a period of at least eight (8) seconds at a time.
2. Transitions from one static image to the next shall appear instantaneously without the appearance
of animation, flashing or movement of any kind.
3. All electronic message centers shall come equipped with automatic dimming technology which
automatically adjusts the sign's brightness in direct correlation with ambient light conditions.
4. No electronic message center shall exceed a brightness level of 0.3 foot candles above ambient
light as measured using a foot candle (Lux) meter at a preset distance depending on sign area. The
measurement distance shall be calculated with the following formula: The square root of the product of
the sign area and one-hundred.
Example using a twelve (12) square foot sign:
Measurement Distance = v(12 Sq. Ft. x 100) = 34.6
5. Intensities in illumination shall be subject to review by the city's electrical inspector. The applicant
will be required to submit an affidavit attesting to the intensities in illumination as outlined in subsection
4a above.
6. The electronic message center sign shall contain a default mechanism that freezes the image in one
(1) position in the event of malfunction. The sign owner shall respond to a malfunction within one (1)
day of a city notification of malfunction.

Sec. 5-1506. - Comprehensive sign program.
A. General principles.
1. The intent of the comprehensive sign program is to provide private property owners and businesses
with flexibility to develop innovative, creative and effective signage and to improve the aesthetics of the
City of North Miami.
2. The minimum sign standards established in this division ensure that signage will not have an
adverse impact on the aesthetics, community character and quality of life of the city. The city
recognizes, however, that in many circumstances, there are innovative and creative alternatives to
minimum standard signage which are desirable and attractive and will enhance community character
and individual property values.
3. The purpose of the comprehensive sign program is to provide an alternative to minimum standard
signage subject to flexibility criteria which ensure that alternative signage will not have an adverse
impact on the aesthetics, community character and quality of life of the City of North Miami.
B. Eligibility. The following forms of development are eligible to utilize the comprehensive sign program:
new large scale development, shopping centers, institutions, mixed use, office complex and residential
complex.
11/10/2019 Print
334/463
C. Permitted signage. Signage which is proposed as a part of a comprehensive sign program may
deviate from the minimum sign standards in terms of numbers of signs per business or parcel of land,
maximum area of a sign face per parcel of land and the total area of sign faces per business or parcel of
land subject to compliance with the flexibility criteria set out in subsection 5-1506D. A comprehensive
sign program shall be approved as a part of the approval required for the development to which it
relates.
D. Flexibility criteria.
1. Architectural theme.
a. The signs proposed in a comprehensive sign program shall be designed as a part of the
architectural theme of the principal buildings proposed or developed on the parcel proposed for
development and shall be constructed of materials and colors which reflect an integrated architectural
vocabulary for the parcel proposed for development; or
b. The design, character, location and/or materials of the signs proposed in a comprehensive sign
program shall be related to the size of a site and be demonstrably more attractive than signs otherwise
permitted on the parcel proposed for development under the minimum sign standards.
2. Community character. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program shall not have an
adverse impact on the community character of the city.
3. Property values. The signage proposed in a comprehensive sign program will not have an adverse
impact on the value of property in the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development.
4. Elimination of unattractive or nonconforming signage. The signage proposed in a comprehensive
sign program will result in the elimination of existing unattractive signage or will result in an
improvement to the appearance of the parcel proposed for development in comparison to signs
otherwise permitted under the minimum sign standards.
Sec. 5-1507. - Nonconforming Signs
A. General. A sign that does not conform to the requirements of this division shall be deemed
nonconforming. A nonconforming sign cannot be modified (excluding re-lettering or change of copy)
unless the modification brings the sign into compliance with all sections of this division, or as outlined in
section 5-1507.C., below.
11/10/2019 Print
335/463
B. Nonconforming Freestanding Signs at Shopping Centers. The city's objectives to improve the visual
aesthetics, appearance, and economic vitality of multi-tenant properties along city thoroughfares will
permit property owners to modify nonconforming freestanding signs at shopping centers beyond the
limitations contained within section 5-1507.A., above, in conformance with the following requirements:
1. The shopping center shall have an adopted sign program in place, or adopts a sign program as part of
this process.
2. A request for an amendment to the existing sign program is approved.
3. The amended sign program will allow improvements to the existing sign structure(s) which do not
increase the mass of the sign (i.e. height, length, width), including removal, repair and/or replacement of
sign cabinets.
4. The proposed improvements will bring the sign into further compliance with the sign regulations, and
improve the aesthetics of the sign.
5. As part of the city's economic development initiatives, additional sign square footage, also known as
"copy area," may be added to the sign in instances when aesthetic improvements and required landscape
improvements are made to, and immediately surrounding the sign, and in situations where the additional
signage does not increase the mass of the sign (i.e., height, length, width).
6. The amount of future repairs of the newly renovated sign that the property owner will be allowed to
complete may not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the new value of the sign, as determined by a licensed
sign contractor and confirmed by staff.
7. The regulations contained in this section are not intended to allow removal and reconstruction of the
sign in entirety, as removal would require the sign to come into compliance with current sign regulation.
C. Repair or Removal. Any nonconforming sign and corresponding support structure that is damaged or
otherwise in need of repair, to such an extent that the cost of repairing the sign equals fifty percent
(50%) or more of the original cost of the sign, then its classification as a "nonconforming" sign under this
section shall be automatically revoked and either repairs be made so that such sign shall meet all the
requirements of this article or such sign shall be removed from the property. Furthermore, any
nonconforming sign and corresponding support structure shall be removed by the owner, agent, or
person having beneficial use of the building, structure, or premises, where such sign may be found if a
bona fide establishment, organization, or residential development ceases its operation or occupancy for
more than six (6) consecutive months.
D. Annexation of Nonconforming Freestanding Signs. Any freestanding monument, pylon, pole, or similar
type of sign located on a property that is proposed to be annexed into the city shall comply with all
11/10/2019 Print
336/463
provisions of this article within six (6) months following the date of such annexation. Any signs subject
to this requirement shall be documented by the city in any applicable ordinance, development order, or
annexation agreement.
Sec. 5-1508. - Abandoned signs.

granted for any sign expressly prohibited by this article. The board of adjustment however, may grant a
variance if it finds that the unusual shape or topography of the property or other mitigating factors (e.g.,
required landscape buffers), prevent signage allowable under the provisions of these LDRs from
adequately identifying the business or other activity located on such property or prevent the viewing of
non-commercial messages. The board of adjustment may only grant a variance to the following:
1. Required Setback. Allow a setback less than that required under the chapter;
2. Sign Area or Height. Allow the area and/or height of a sign to be increased by up to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the maximum allowable height or area; or
3. Number of Signs. Allow the number of signs to be increased over the maximum allowed by this
code.

modified on private property, public lands, or within city rights-of-way without first securing the
necessary city approvals and permits as provided hereunder, except in instances when exempt from
these LDRs. The following processes and permits are intended to ensure that all signage complies with
the standards of this article:
1. Site plan review. Except for individually platted lots containing single-family and duplex homes
located within single-family and two-family residential zoning districts, the site plan review process shall
be required and reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in these LDRs prior to the
issuance of any sign permit. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "site plan" is construed to
include master site plan and technical site plan applications.
2. Sign permit. The sign permit process shall be required, and initiated only subsequent to the approval
of a site plan application, except in those instances when site plan review is not required.
a. The sign permit application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
these LDRs, unless the building official determines that compliance with the Florida Building Code is
necessary. In these instances, the sign permit shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in as set forth in the LDRs.
b. Any sign, including the support structure, which is erected, altered, displayed, or changed without a
sign permit is considered an illegal sign, and shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein.

continue until the applicant has submitted a complete application or demands that the application be
reviewed as is, without further revisions.
f. If an applicant fails to provide additional information as requested by the director within ninety
days of the request or respond to the director or designee with a time when the information will be
submitted, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn by the applicant. The applicant shall be
entitled to one ninety calendar-day extension upon request, providing the request for extension is
granted prior to the expiration of the ninety-day period.
g. The director shall approve or deny the sign permit within twenty business days of receipt of the
complete application or the applicants demand for review as submitted, based on whether it complies
with the requirements of this article. The director shall prepare a written notice of the decision, either in
the form of an approved sign permit or written notice of denial, and provide such written notice to the
applicant of its decision within the twenty-day period.
h. Appeals. In the event a sign permit is denied by the director, the decision may be appealed to the

telecommunications towers and antennas and are intended to accomplish the following purposes: (a)
protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city; (b)
minimize residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; (c)
encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and to locate them, to the extent possible, in
areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; (d) minimize the total number of towers
throughout the community by strongly encouraging the colocation of antennas on new and pre-existing
11/10/2019 Print
348/463
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; (e) encourage
users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of
the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative
camouflaging techniques; (f) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community through an efficient and timely application process. In
furtherance of these goals, the city shall at all times give due consideration to the city's master plan,
zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas, including hurricane preparedness
areas, in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1(exh. 1), 4-28-09)

(45) business days after the date the properly completed application is submitted in accordance
with the city's application procedures, provided that such permit complies with applicable federal
regulations and is consistent with state law and applicable local zoning or land development regulations,
including any aesthetic requirements. Local building regulations shall apply.
B. The city shall notify the permit applicant within twenty (20) business days after the date the
application is submitted as to whether the application is, for administrative purposes only, properly
completed and has been properly submitted. However, such determination shall not be deemed as an
approval of the application. Any notification shall indicate with specificity any deficiencies which, if
cured, shall make the application properly completed. If the city fails to grant or deny a properly
completed application for a permit which has been properly submitted within the timeframes set forth in
this section, the permit shall be deemed automatically approved and the provider may proceed with
placement of such facilities without interference or penalty. The timeframes specified in this section
shall be extended only to the extent that the permit has not been granted or denied because the city's
procedures generally applicable to all permits require action by the city and such action has not taken
place within the timeframes specified in this section. Under such circumstances, the city must act to
either grant or deny the permit at its next regularly scheduled meeting or, otherwise, the permit shall be
deemed to be automatically approved.
C. Applicants regulated by this division may request a preapplication conference with the city. Such
requests shall be submitted with a nonrefundable fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to reimburse the
city for the cost and fees incurred by the conference. Every new telecommunications tower and antenna
shall be subject to the following minimum standards:
1. Lease required. Any construction, installation or placement of a telecommunications facility on any
property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city shall require a lease agreement executed by
the city and the owner of the facility, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. The city may require,
as a condition of entering into a lease agreement with a telecommunications service provider, the
dedication of space on the facility for public health and safety purposes, as well as property
improvement on the leased space. Any dedications and improvements shall be negotiated prior to
execution of the lease.
2. Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory
uses. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation
of an antenna or tower on such lot.

A. Applicability. The provisions contained in this division shall be considered minimum standards
applicable to all public or private property within the city, unless otherwise exempted by law. The
applicable City Code provisions, as amended, are adopted and incorporated by reference as if fully set
forth herein, provided that, in the event of an express conflict between a county ordinance and a
provision of this division, the latter shall prevail.
B. Intent and purpose. In recognizing that trees benefit the city by decreasing urban noise and air
pollution, conserving energy and retaining soil, minimizing flooding, providing food and shelter to birds
and wildlife, and preserving the community's character and quality of life, it is the intent of the city
council to regulate the removal, relocation, replacement and abuse of trees and to protect, preserve and
restore the city's tree canopy. The purpose of this division is to recognize the contribution of trees to the
environment and the positive correlation of trees to the health, safety, and welfare of residents. This
division strives to achieve the tree preservation and protection through;
C. The increase, renewal, and proliferation of trees and the tree canopy; and
1. The protection of existing trees, especially specimen trees, specimen palms and Floridas Protected
Trees; and
2. The reduction of the adverse impacts of invasive or controlled plant species.
D. Tree removal permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to cut down,
destroy, remove or move, or effectively remove through damaging, any tree within the city without first
obtaining a tree removal permit, unless the tree is exempted herein. In addition to code compliance fines
and penalties pursuant to section 21-76 of the city code, the city may require the tree to be replaced, or
the equivalent monetary amount be paid to the tree mitigation fund, pursuant to the provisions of this
division. A tree removal permit shall be required for the pruning of any tree roots, except for the pruning
of roots when essential for any repairs or improvements performed by the city public works department
E. Authority to administer this division. The community planning & development department shall have
the general management and supervision of all trees, shrubs and plants embraced by this division.
F. Review of permits for removal in rights-of-way, government properties. The city public works
department shall review and make the determination for tree removal for trees in rights-of-way and on
government properties.

any salt water, oil or injurious substance upon any area where such material may enter the ground at the
roots of any tree.
I. Joint and several liability of agent and owner of record. Any agent or representative, including without
limitation a contractor or subcontractor, who applies for a tree removal permit on behalf of an owner of
record or, who on behalf of said owner removes a tree without a permit or otherwise violates this
division, is jointly and severally liable with the owner of the property for resulting costs, fees, or fines.
The city may pursue, in its sole discretion, one or more liable parties to recover said costs, fees, or fines.
J. Liability for unpaid costs, fees or fines. Any person or entity who is liable for unpaid costs, fees, or
fines under this division is subject to the placement of a "stop work" order on any project involving said
person or entity until such time as the costs, fees, or fines are paid to the city. No person or entity liable
for unpaid costs, fees, or fines under this chapter shall be entitled to obtain or perform work under any
other permits until such time as the costs, fees, or fines are paid to the city.
K. Building permits affecting trees. No building permit for any work that has the potential of affecting
trees, including new construction, additions, demolition, installation of carports, pools, decks, fences,
driveways, parking lots, tennis courts, or similar work, shall be issued, unless the building department
has determined that a tree removal permit is not required or that a valid tree removal permit has been
issued in accordance with this division.
L. Emergencies. If any tree is determined to be in hazardous or dangerous condition so as to endanger
the public health, welfare, or safety, and requires immediate removal without delay, verbal authorization
by phone may be given by the community planning and development department, the parks and
recreation department, the public works department, or the city manager, and the tree removed without
obtaining a written permit as required by this article. In the case of emergencies such as a hurricane or
