The following financial management policies are adopted effective January 1, 1998.  Provided, further, that the city manager is hereby authorized to revise said policies as necessary during the course of day-to-day operations.  Any such revisions made by the city manager shall be distributed to the board of directors.  Revisions which amount to a material change to the overall intent or spirit of the following policies shall be submitted to the board of directors. 
 
2-5-7.1.  Financial management policies - Purpose. 
 
The following guidelines are hereby established to assist management and the board of directors when making financial decisions about the future of Hot Springs.  In this manner, the board of directors will be able to view the present approach to financial management from an overall, long-range vantage point. 
 
Many financial policies have been established in various written documents over the years.  Consolidating these policies into one document avoids conflicting, inconsistent or incomplete policies. 
 
2-5-7.2.  Financial management policies - Operating budget policies. 
 
The city will use a decentralized operating budget process.  All departments will be given an opportunity to participate in the budget preparation process.  Once the budget is adopted, each department is responsible for controlling expenses so that the budget is not exceeded. 
 
Annual fixed budgets will be adopted for all operating funds.  The budget must be balanced for all budgeted funds.  Total anticipated revenues plus that portion of beginning fund balance in excess of the required fund balance reserve must equal total estimated expenditures for all budgeted funds. 
 
The city will attempt to maintain an unreserved fund balance in the general fund to pay expenditures caused by unforeseen emergencies and for cash flow purposes.  The unreserved fund balance shall be maintained at an amount which represents the approximate equivalent of 16.5% of annual operating expenses.(Res. No. 8009, 8-21-2012) 
 
All appropriations lapse at year-end.  Any encumbered appropriations for major capital projects and capital assets at year-end may be reappropriated by the board of directors in the subsequent year.

All budgets shall be adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles as promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  Revenues are budgeted when they become measurable and available and expenditures are charged against the budget when they become measurable, a fund liability has been incurred, and that liability will be liquidated with current resources. 
 
The budget shall be adopted at the legal level of control which is major classification by department within each individual fund.  However, the finance director shall have the authority to transfer appropriations within a department within the same fund from one line item to other line items within the same major classification.

The following debt policy for the City of Hot Springs is hereby adopted. 
 
2-5-9.1. Debt policy - Purpose. 
 
To utilize debt financing which will provide needed capital equipment and infrastructure improvements while minimizing the impact of debt payments on current revenues. 
 
2-5-9.2. Debt policy - Use of debt financing. 
 
Debt financing, to include general obligation bonds, property tax supported bonds, sales tax supported bonds,  revenue bonds,  lease purchase agreements, and other obligations permitted to be issued or incurred under Arkansas law, shall only be used to purchase capital assets that cannot be acquired from either current revenues or fund balance/retained earnings and to fund infrastructure improvements and additions.  The useful life of the asset or project shall exceed the payout schedule of any debt the city assumes. 
 
2-5-9.3. Debt policy - Assumption of additional debt. 
 
The city shall not assume general purpose debt without conducting an objective analysis as to the community's ability to assume and support additional debt service payments.  When appropriate, self-supporting revenue bonds shall be issued before general purpose debt.

2-5-9.4. Debt policy - Affordability targets. 
 
(a) General Obligation and Property Tax Bonds.  The city shall use an objective analytical approach to determine whether it can afford to assume new general purpose debt.  This process shall compare generally accepted standards of affordability to the current values for the city.  These standards shall include debt per capita, debt as a percent of taxable value, debt service payments as a percent of current revenues and current expenditures, and the level of overlapping net debt of all local taxing jurisdictions.  The process shall also examine the direct costs and benefits of the proposed expenditures.  The decision on whether or not to assume new debt shall be based on these costs and benefits, the current conditions of the municipal bond market, and the city's ability to "afford" new debt as determined by the aforementioned standards.  The city shall strive to achieve and/or maintain these standards at a low to moderate classification.  Under no circumstances will the general obligation and property tax supported debt exceed the amount prescribed by Arkansas Statutes. 
 
(b) Revenue and Sales Tax Bonds.  For the city to issue new revenue bonds, projected revenues, as defined in the ordinance authorizing the revenue bonds in question, shall be a minimum of 125% of the average annual debt service. 
 
2-5-9.5. Debt policy - Debt structure. 
 
The useful life of an asset acquired with debt financing shall equal or exceed the average principal maturity of the debt amortization schedule. The overall structure of a fund=s debt should approximate level debt service for revenue bonds.  There shall be no "balloon" bond repayment schedules which consist of low annual payments and one large payment of the balance due at the end of the term.  There shall typically be at least interest paid in the first fiscal year after a bond sale and principal starting no later than the second fiscal year after the bond issue.  
 
2-5-9.6. Debt policy - Call provisions. 
 
Call provisions for bond issues shall be made as short as possible consistent with the lowest interest cost to the city.  When possible, all bonds shall be callable only at par. 
 
2-5-9.7. Debt policy - Sale process. 
 
The city prefers to use a competitive bidding process in the sale of general obligation and property tax supported debt, unless the nature of the issue warrants a negotiated sale.  The city shall attempt to award the bonds based on a true interest cost (TIC) basis.  For revenue and sales tax bonds, the city has historically used negotiated sale. 
 
2-5-9.8. Debt policy - Rating agencies presentations. 
 
Full disclosure of operations and open lines of communication shall be made to the rating agencies.  City staff, with assistance of financial advisors, shall prepare the necessary materials and presentation to the rating agencies.  Credit rating will be sought from Moody's or Standard & Poor's as recommended by the city's investment banker and/or financial advisor.

2-5-9.9. Debt policy - Continuing disclosure. 
 
The city is committed to continuing disclosure of financial and pertinent credit information relevant to the city's outstanding securities and will abide by the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c2-12 concerning primary and secondary market disclosure. 
 
2-5-9.10. Debt policy - Debt refunding. 
 
City staff and the financial advisor shall monitor the municipal bond market for opportunities  to obtain interest savings by refunding outstanding debt.  As a general rule, the present value savings of a particular refunding should exceed 5% of the refunded maturities. 
 
2-5-9.11. Debt policy - Interest earnings. 
 
Interest earnings received on the investment of bond proceeds shall be used to assist in paying the interest due on bond issues, unless otherwise needed to support project requirements or fund debt service reserves, to the extent permitted by law. 
 
2-5-9.12. Debt policy - Lease/Purchase agreements. 
 
Over the lifetime of a lease, the total cost to the city will generally be higher than purchasing the asset outright.  As a result, the use of lease/purchase agreements in the acquisition of vehicles, equipment and other capital assets shall typically be used for items that cost $100,000 or more.  Generally, capital asset(s) costing less than $100,000 will be purchased on a Apay-as-you-go" basis.

CHAPTER  9 
 
CITY/COUNTY INTERLOCAL AGREEMENTS 
 
 
2-9-1. Interlocal agreement for detention services. 
 
(a) Purpose.  The purpose of this Interlocal Agreement (ILA) is to establish a formal binding relationship between the city and Garland County (hereafter referred to as "the county") for the housing of city prisoners at the Garland County Detention Facility (hereafter referred to as "the facility").  For the purpose of this agreement, city prisoners are those individuals arrested by the police department and held under custody of municipal court.  A city prisoner becomes a county prisoner at such time as he is bound over to the circuit court. 
 
(b) Support and medical services.   
 
(1) The county agrees to accept and provide for the secure custody, care and safekeeping of city prisoners in accordance with federal, state, and local laws, standards, policies, procedures, or court orders applicable to the operations of the facility. 
 
(2) The county agrees to provide city prisoners with the same level of medical care and services provided county prisoners including the transportation and security for prisoners requiring removal from the facility for emergency medical services.  All costs associated with hospital or health care services for city prisoners, whether provided inside or outside the facility, will be paid directly by the city.  If it is required that an inmate be confined in a hospital or other outside facility and guarding of that inmate is necessary, it will be the responsibility of the city, if the individual is a city prisoner, to bear the cost of the manpower necessary to guard the prisoner while confined in another facility. 
 
(3) The county agrees to notify the city as soon as possible of all emergency medical cases requiring removal of a prisoner from the facility and to obtain prior authorization for removal for all other required medical services, and such authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
 
(4) The county will be responsible for the transportation of all prisoners, both city and county, to and from municipal court and providing guard services at that location.

(5) Those inmates being housed in the facility that are classified as trustees will be released to a representative of the city on a regular basis upon request.  It will be the responsibility of the city to provide for the secure custody, care supervision and safekeeping of these individuals when away from the jail. 
 
(c) Receiving and bookkeeping procedures.  Once a city police officer enters the booking room of the facility with a prisoner, that prisoner is hereby determined to be in the custody of the jail personnel at the facility, and the police officer has no further supervision responsibilities or duties for that individual.  The city police officer, once a prisoner is in custody of jail personnel, should thereafter fill out the proper paperwork required of an arresting officer. 
 
In the event the city police department desires copies of fingerprints, photographs, arrest reports, or other materials or documents concerning city prisoners which have been assembled by the Garland County sheriff's department, the city will reimburse the county for its costs in reproducing and providing said materials.  The county agrees to provide requested copies and other documents in a reasonable time after request is made by the city. 
 
(d) Cost and reimbursement.  The city agrees to pay the county the following detention services rates effective March 1, 1991 for city prisoners housed at the facility on behalf of the city: 
 
$12.00 for each individual booked or processed at the facility and held less than six (6) hours; 
 
$31.00 for each individual booked or processed at the facility and held for at least six (6) hours but no more than twenty-four (24) hours; and 
 
$31.00 per "prisoner day" for each individual held for more than twenty-four (24) hours. 
 
For purposes of this agreement, a prisoner day shall be computed by charging the city for the day of arrival, but not for the day of departure.  Inmates held for a brief period in either the holding cells or the intoxication cells, whether booked or not, before being released, are not considered to be prisoners subject to "prisoner days" for billing purposes but may be subject to the applicable rates for less than twenty-four (24) hour detainment as enumerated above. 
 
The detention service rates shall be subject to review prior to the end of each calendar year based on actual costs associated with the operation of the city, excluding debt service on the facility, which was in existence as of May 1, 1988.  Any subsequent rate adjustment/revision shall become effective January 1 of each year and shall remain in effect for the entire calendar year.  Rate adjustments/revisions shall be effected by resolution of the city and county governing bodies.

The city will provide payment to the county on a monthly basis based on the invoice received each month.  The name, title, complete address and telephone number of the county official responsible for invoice preparation should also be listed on the invoice. 
 
Individuals who have outstanding warrants issued by both the city and county sheriff's office will be considered to be the responsibility of the arresting agency.

(e) Period of performance.  This agreement shall be in effect indefinitely until terminated in writing by either party, with said written notice being sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery, to the Garland County judge if the city desires to terminate said agreement or to the city manager if the county wishes to terminate said agreement.

(f) Indemnity clause.  The county will defend all lawsuits and pay all judgments, including attorney fees, whenever the city is named as a party and:  
 
(1) said lawsuit is brought by a current or former inmate(s) housed in the facility; and 
 
(2) said lawsuit alleges a cause of action which occurred after the inmate or inmates were delivered to the custody of jail personnel at the facility and prior to discharge. 
 
(g) Administrator.  There shall be no administrator position or joint board established pursuant to the terms of this contract. 
 
(h) Modifications/disputes.  Either party may initiate a request for modification to this agreement in writing.

2-11-9.1.  Substance abuse policy - Policy statement. 
 
It is the policy of the City of Hot Springs to provide a work environment free from the effects of the illegal use of drugs and the misuse of alcohol.  The city is dedicated to ensuring that our employees are both physically and mentally prepared at all times to assume the duties and responsibilities of their respective jobs and to provide efficient services to the citizens they are employed to serve.  Our employees are our most valuable resource, and it is the city=s goal to provide a healthy and satisfying work environment which promotes personal opportunities for growth. 
 
2-11-9.2.  Substance abuse policy - Purpose. 
 
The purpose of this policy is to assure worker fitness for duty and to protect employees and the public from the risks posed by the misuse of alcohol and the use of prohibited drugs.  The city=s policy will comply with all applicable federal regulations governing workplace anti-drug and alcohol programs as outlined below. 
 
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has published 49 CFR Part 382 which mandates urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for all employees operating a commercial motor vehicle subject to the commercial driver=s license requirements and prohibits performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. 
 
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens.  In addition, the Federal Government published 48 CFR Part 29 (The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988) which requires the establishment of drug-free workplace policies and the reporting of certain drug-related offenses. 
 
The City of Hot Springs Board of Directors, for the sake of convenience and fairness, has further adopted these regulations and procedures to apply to other positions not under the authority of DOT or its agencies; any such requirements and/or disciplinary actions established under the City=s authority are indicated by the use of a bold script font. 
 
2-11-9.3. Substance abuse policy - Applicability. 
 
This policy applies to all non-transit employees who: 
 
(l) hold a Commercial Driver=s License (CDL) including, but not limited to, regular full-time drivers, casual, intermittent and occasional drivers;

(b) Alcohol.  This includes the use of beverages containing alcohol or any other substances (including any medication, mouthwash, food or candy) such that alcohol is present in the body while performing job duties.  The concentration of alcohol is expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by a breath testing device. 
 
2-11-9.5. Substance abuse policy - Legal drugs. 
 
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited; however, the use of any substance which carries a warning label indicating that mental functions, motor skills or judgment may be adversely affected must be discussed by employees with their appropriate health care professional before performing work-related duties.  Educational information regarding prescription and over-the-counter medications should be obtained from either a health care professional or pharmacist.  Employees are strongly urged to seek and obtain medical advice prior to using prescription or over-the-counter drugs that may adversely affect their ability to safely perform their job functions.   
 
Any employee taking medications or drugs which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of duties or operation of vehicles and equipment must so notify his/her supervisor before beginning work.  The employee may be temporarily reassigned to other duties when appropriate.  Failure to provide such notice can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  In the event of a question regarding an employee=s ability to safely and effectively perform assigned duties while using such medication or drugs, clearance from a qualified physician will be required.

A legally prescribed drug means that the individual has a prescription or other written approval from a physician for the use of a drug in the course of medical treatment.  If an employee tests positive for drugs, s/he must provide, within 24 hours, a valid prescription.  A valid prescription includes the patient=s name, the name of the substance, quantity/amount to be taken and the time period of the authorization.  The misuse or abuse of legal drugs is prohibited during working hours, on breaks, during meal periods, when in uniform, while on City premises or at work sites in an official capacity as a representative of the City or while operating any City vehicle or equipment. 
 
2-11-9.6. Substance abuse policy - Prohibited conduct. 
 
All employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited substances at all times.  Employees are not to report for duty or remain on duty when they have used any controlled substance, except when the use is pursuant to the instructions of a licensed medical practitioner who has advised the employee that the substance will not adversely affect their ability to safely perform their duties.  Employees who violate these provisions will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  Law enforcement will be notified, as appropriate, when criminal activity is suspected. 
 
Any employee who is reasonably suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited substance or not fit for duty will be suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of condition.  Employees who fail to pass a drug or alcohol test will be removed from duty and referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP).  Failure to obtain a SAP evaluation and/or to follow the SAP=s recommended treatment will be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  A drug or alcohol test is considered positive if the individual is found to have a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. 
 
No employee will be allowed to report for duty or remain on duty when his/her ability to perform assigned duties is adversely affected by alcohol or when his/her breath alcohol concentration is 0.04 or greater.  No employee may use alcohol within four hours of reporting for duty, while on duty or during any hours they are on call.  Violation of these provisions will be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
 
If an alcohol confirmation test result is 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, the employee will not be permitted to return to work until the start of his/her next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test. 
 
Any employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing will be removed from duty, will be considered as having a positive test and will be referred to a Substance Abuse Professional for evaluation.  Failure to obtain a SAP evaluation and/or failure to follow the SAP=s recommended treatment plan will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.  Any employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination,

Refusal can include an inability to provide a sufficient urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as verbal declaration, obstructive behavior or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test. 
 
2-11-9.7. Substance abuse policy - Employee admission of alcohol and/or drug use. 
 
An employee who makes a voluntary admission of alcohol misuse or controlled substances use will not be subject to disciplinary action provided: 
 
(a) the employee does not self-identify in order to avoid testing under the requirements of applicable regulations and/or this policy; 
 
(b) the employee makes the admission prior to performing a safety-sensitive function (i.e., prior to reporting for duty); 
 
(c) the employee does not perform a safety-sensitive function until s/he has been evaluated and has successfully completed education and/or treatment and return-to-duty testing requirements as outlined herein; and 
 
(d) the admission is made to a supervisor or the city=s Designated Employer Representative (DER). 
 
When an employee makes a voluntary admission (under the conditions outlined above) of alcohol misuse or controlled substances use, s/he will immediately be suspended from performing safety-sensitive functions and will be allowed sufficient opportunity to seek evaluation, education and/or treatment to establish control over his/her drug or alcohol problem.  S/He will be permitted to return to safety-sensitive duties only upon successful completion of an educational and/or treatment program as determined by a drug and alcohol abuse evaluation expert (i.e., employee assistance professional, substance abuse professional or qualified drug and alcohol counselor) AND has undergone a return-to-duty breath alcohol test with a result of less than 0.02 and/or a return-to-duty drug test with a verified negative result.  Follow-up testing will be required with a minimum of six drug and/or alcohol tests within the next 12 months after returning to duty; if the evaluation expert recommends more frequent follow-up testing, his/her recommendation will be followed. 
 
2-11-9.8. Substance abuse policy - Testing procedures. 
 
Urine drug testing and breath testing for alcohol will be conducted when circumstances warrant or as required by federal regulations and City policy.  All employees will be subject to drug testing prior to employment and to drug and/or alcohol testing for reasonable suspicion.  In addition, all safety-sensitive employees will be subject to random and post-accident drug and/or alcohol testing.  All employees with a positive drug or alcohol test (first offense) will be required to undergo return-to-duty testing prior to returning to safety-sensitive duties; follow-up testing will be conducted for a period of one to five years based on the SAP=s recommendation, with at least six tests performed during the first year.

An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen.  For those specimens that are not negative, a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectometry (GC/MS) test will be performed.  The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.  
 
All drug testing laboratory results will only be released to and reviewed by a qualified Medical Review Officer (MRO) in order to verify and validate test results.  The MRO will release findings only to the Designated Employer Representative (DER).  The MRO will be a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual=s confirmed positive test result.  Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the MRO is responsible for contacting the employee, on a direct and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes to discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the positive result.  An MRO staff person may make the contact; the MRO=s medically licensed or certified staff person may gather information.  If, after reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may contact the DER for assistance in contacting the employee.  The DER will take maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO contact. 
 
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO nor the DER is able to contact the employee within 14 days of the date the MRO received the confirmed positive test result from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.  The MRO may also

The MRO may reopen the verification of a positive test if the employee presents documentation of serious injury or illness or other circumstances that unavoidably prevented the employee from being contacted within the designated time period and, if the employee then presents a legitimate (in the MRO=s opinion) explanation for the positive test, the MRO will declare the test to be negative.  The MRO will review and interpret an individual=s medical history, including any medical records and biomedical information provided, affording the individual an opportunity to discuss the test result, and decide whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for the result, including legally prescribed medication. 
 
The MRO can declare a test invalid or canceled based on the regulations specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.  A canceled/invalid test is considered neither a positive nor a negative test.  An example of a canceled test is a urine sample being rejected by the laboratory.  The MRO will cancel the test and report the cancellation and the reason(s) for it to the appropriate agency, employer and employee. 
 
Any drug test with a Apositive dilute@ result will be treated as a verified positive test.  Any drug test that is reported as Anegative dilute@ will require the employee or applicant for employment to be retested immediately upon receipt of the result.  If an employee is directed to take another test and declines, that employee has refused the test and will be required to follow the same procedures as outlined for positive drug test results.  The result of the second test will become the test of record.  A second negative dilute result will be treated as a negative test, and no further retesting will be required. 
 
Tests for breath alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing an Evidential Breath Testing device (EBT) that has been approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and operated by a trained Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT).  All breath alcohol test results will be reported only by an MRO or BAT to the DER. 
 
If the initial breath test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test.  An employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of greater than 0.02 but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her position for at least 24 hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02.  An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of this policy and/or of the requirements set forth in 49 CFR Part 382.   
 
Any employee who has a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test (first offense) will be suspended from work and referred to a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP).  Any employee who has a second confirmed positive drug or alcohol test will be terminated. 
 
All drug testing will be accomplished by urine test utilizing the split sample method and chain-of-custody control.  Any employee who questions a positive drug test result may request that an additional test be conducted.  This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory than performed the initial test.  The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample.  All costs for such

The method of collecting, storing and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.  The employee=s request for a split sample test must be made to the MRO within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result.  Requests made after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee.  
 
2-11-9-9. Substance abuse policy - Required testing. 
 
PRE-EMPLOYMENT drug tests will be conducted on each applicant selected for hire into any regular full-time or regular part-time position.  Applicants selected for hire into temporary/seasonal positions will be drug tested if they are required to have a CDL or will be performing safety-sensitive functions.  A job offer may be made prior to the test only if it includes the condition that the applicant tests negative.  No applicant will be hired prior to the City=s receipt of a verified negative test result.  Any applicant who tests positive will not be eligible for hire for a period of at least six months.  At any time after the end of the six-month period, the applicant, if again selected for hire, must: 
 
(a) show proof of successfully completing a substance abuse treatment program and 
 
(b) complete a new drug test with a negative result. 
 
Pre-Employment (Pre-Transfer) drug tests will be conducted on each employee selected for transfer from a non-safety-sensitive position to a safety-sensitive position.  No employee will be transferred to a safety-sensitive position prior to the City=s receipt of a verified negative test result. 
 
After obtaining written consent from an applicant with a CDL (including employees transferring from a non-CDL position to one requiring a CDL), the City will request the following information from DOT-regulated employers who have employed that individual for any period during the two years before the date of application or transfer: 
 
(a) Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol concentration 
 
(b) Verified positive drug test results 
 
(c) Refusals to be tested 
 
(d) Other violations of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations 
 
(e) Documentation of successful completion of DOT return-to-duty requirements (including follow-up testing) for any applicant or employee who violated a DOT drug and/or alcohol regulation

REASONABLE SUSPICION drug and/or alcohol tests will be conducted when a determination is made that reasonable suspicion exists to require the employee to undergo testing.  This determination must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee.  The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. 
 
The determination must be made by a supervisor or City official who is trained in detecting the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use.  The supervisor must complete and sign a written record of the observations leading to a reasonable suspicion; this record must be completed within 24 hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the alcohol or drug test are released, whichever is earlier.  Reasonable suspicion tests will be coordinated with the Human Resources Director whenever possible.  All employees are subject to reasonable suspicion testing. 
 
Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing is authorized only if the observations described above are made during, just preceding or just after performance of safety-sensitive duties.  An employee may be directed to undergo reasonable suspicion alcohol testing while s/he is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before s/he is to perform safety-sensitive functions or just after s/he has ceased performing such functions. 
 
Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol test, no employee is permitted to report for duty or remain on duty while s/he is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor will the City permit the employee to perform his/her duties until: 
 
(a) an alcohol test is administered and the employee=s alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; OR 
 
(b) twenty-four hours have elapsed following the determination that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the provisions of this policy concerning the use of alcohol. 
 
If a reasonable suspicion alcohol test is not administered within two hours following the determination, the employee=s supervisor or department head must prepare a record stating the reason(s) the test was not promptly administered.  If the test is not administered within eight hours following the determination, all attempts to administer an alcohol test will cease, and the employee=s supervisor or department head must prepare a record stating the reason(s) the test was not administered.  Any records prepared in accordance with this section must be submitted to and retained by the Human Resources Director. 
 
POST-ACCIDENT drug and alcohol testing will be conducted on employees performing safety-sensitive functions after any accident involving the loss of human life.  For non-fatal accidents, employees will be tested if they receive a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident (within eight hours of the accident for alcohol testing and within 32 hours of the accident for drug testing) AND

(a) the accident involves bodily injury to any person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident OR 
 
(b) one or more vehicles incurs disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle. 
 
An employee who is subject to post-accident testing must remain readily available for such testing or s/he may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing.  This is not intended to delay any necessary medical attention for injured people or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.  If it is necessary for an employee to leave the scene of an accident prior to testing, the employee must keep his/her supervisor informed of his/her location. 
 
An employee subject to post-accident alcohol testing must not use alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until s/he undergoes a post-accident alcohol test, whichever occurs first. 
 
If a required post-accident alcohol test is not administered within two hours following the accident, the employee=s supervisor or department head must prepare a record stating the reason(s) the test was not promptly administered.  If the test is not administered within eight hours following the accident, all attempts to administer an alcohol test will cease, and the employee=s supervisor or department head must prepare a record stating the reason(s) the test was not administered.  If a required post-accident drug test is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, all attempts to administer a drug test will cease, and the employee=s supervisor or department head must prepare a record stating the reason(s) the test was not administered.  Any records prepared in accordance with this section must be submitted to and retained by the Human Resources Director. 
 
RANDOM drug and alcohol testing will be performed on an unannounced basis and will be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.  The selection of employees for random alcohol and controlled substances testing will be made by a scientifically valid method so that each employee subject to random testing will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.  Once notified of selection for random testing, an employee must proceed to the collection site immediately.  Employees subject to random testing are as follows: 
 
DOT - all non-transit employees who operate City vehicles and equipment requiring a Commercial Driver=s License (CDL); employees in this category are tested under the authority of and in compliance with DOT regulations as specified in 49 CFR Part 40 and FMCSA regulations as specified in 49 CFR Part 382 
 
POLICE - all uniformed and communications employees of the Hot Springs Police Department; all employees in this category are tested under the authority of the City of Hot Springs Board of Directors

RETURN-TO-DUTY and FOLLOW-UP drug and/or alcohol testing will be conducted when any safety-sensitive employee returns to safety-sensitive duties after a violation of the prohibited alcohol and/or drug conduct, refuses to submit to an alcohol and/or drug test or has a verified positive alcohol and/or drug test result (first offense).  In order to return to work, the employee must have: 
 
(a) been evaluated by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) and followed any recommendation(s) for action by the SAP, including participation in any rehabilitation program AND 
 
(b) taken a return-to-duty alcohol test with results indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 and/or a drug test with a verified negative result.  If a test is canceled, the employee must take another return-to-duty drug and/or alcohol test. 
 
Follow-up tests will be unannounced and conducted at least six times within the first twelve months after the employee returns to duty.  Any additional follow-up testing will be as recommended by the SAP.  Follow-up tests will be in addition to any random tests and may be extended for up to five years following return to duty. 
 
2-11-9.10. Substance abuse policy - Consequences of a positive test. 
 
Alcohol.  If the confirmation test result is 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, the employee will not be permitted to return to work until the start of his/her next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test. 
 
If the confirmation test result is 0.04 or greater (first offense), the employee will immediately be suspended from performing safety-sensitive functions pending evaluation by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), completion of any recommended education, treatment, etc. and a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result of less than 0.02.  Upon return to duty, the employee will then be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol tests (no less than six within the following 12 months). 
 
If the confirmation test result is 0.04 or greater and represents the second positive test (drugs and/or alcohol) for the employee, s/he will be terminated.

Controlled Substances (Drugs).  If the result of the primary specimen analysis is positive, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) will notify the employee of the positive result and the employee may, within 72 hours of such notification, request that the split sample be tested in a different DHHS laboratory for the presence of the substance(s) that showed a positive result.  A SECOND TEST WILL NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE REQUESTS IT WITHIN 72 HOURS OF NOTIFICATION BY THE MRO OF THE POSITIVE RESULT UNLESS THE DELAY IS DUE TO DOCUMENTABLE FACTS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE EMPLOYEE.   
 
Once a verified positive test result has been received from the MRO, the employee will immediately be suspended from performing safety-sensitive functions until 72 hours have elapsed or, if the employee has requested a split sample test, until the split sample test results are received.  If the split sample test result is negative, the employee will return to work and be paid for any period of suspension; the City will pay the cost of the split sample test.  If the split sample test is not requested or if it reconfirms the positive result (first offense), the employee will be further suspended from performing safety-sensitive functions until s/he has been evaluated by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), completed any recommended education, treatment, etc. and had a negative return-to-duty drug test.  Upon return to duty, the employee will then be subject to unannounced follow-up drug testing (no less than six tests within the following 12 months). 
 
If the employee does not request a split sample test or if the split sample test reconfirms the positive result and this represents the second positive test (drug and/or alcohol) for the employee, s/he will be terminated effective his/her last day worked. 
 
General - An employee will be permitted to use any accrued sick, vacation and/or discretionary leave during the time of evaluation and treatment, provided the evaluation and any recommended treatment are processed in a timely manner.  By the next business day after notification from the Human Resources Director, an employee must contact a Substance Abuse Professional and set up the earliest possible appointment for evaluation.  Any required treatment must begin as soon as possible.  Any delays in facilitating this process will result in the time off being unpaid or the employee may be terminated.  Unless otherwise recommended by the SAP, the return-to-duty test must be completed no later than the next business day following notification from the SAP that the employee has completed any recommended education, treatment, etc.  If an employee has no accrued leave or exhausts his/her accrued leave prior to return to duty, a leave of absence without pay may be granted in accordance with City policy. 
 
 
IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS A VERIFIED POSITIVE TEST RESULT FOR DRUGS AND/OR A CONFIRMED ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION OF 0.04 OR GREATER A SECOND TIME, S/HE WILL BE TERMINATED.  THIS APPLIES TO ANY COMBINATION OF ALCOHOL AND/OR DRUG TEST RESULTS.

An employee may voluntarily report to his/her supervisor, or any management official, that he/she has a substance abuse problem without fear of immediate dismissal, as long as such report is made prior to the employee being requested to take a drug or alcohol test.  Such a report will constitute mandatory referral to a rehabilitation center or drug alcohol abuse assistance program.  If restriction of work activity is determined necessary while undergoing treatment, the employee may request sick leave, vacation leave or leave without pay during such period of rehabilitation.  If an employee fails to avail him or herself of such help and violations of this policy do occur, the City will have little choice but to act severely against such violators in the interests of protecting all of our employees and the citizens.

CHAPTER  13 
 
CODE OF ETHICS 
2-13-1.  Code of Ethics.  
 
2-13-1.1.  General policy. 
 
It is essential to the proper working of city government that: 
 
(a) There is a spirit of working together among city officials that reflects caring and concern for all those who depend on us, good stewardship for the taxpayer and respect for all the people we work with. 
 
(b) All city officials and employees be dedicated to the highest ideals of honesty and integrity. 
 
(c) Even the appearance of an impropriety in our decision making process must be avoided. 
 
2-13-1.2.  Purpose of Code. 
 
The purpose of this Code is to provide a Code of Ethics for the city of Hot Springs.  Working for government is a very special vocation.  It involves a special kind of public trust. Those who are elected to public office and those who are appointed to positions of authority are expected by the public not only to follow the law but to go above that and set the standard for integrity, honesty, courtesy, and good stewardship. 
 
If each city official will follow the suggestions in the Code of Ethics contained herein, he/she will have done his/her part to ensure objectivity and promote public confidence in city government.  This Code is more stringent than what is required by law but it does not go beyond what is expected by the citizens of the city of Hot Springs.  The only enforcement to anything mentioned in the Code which does not have force of law must rely on what is in the heart of each individual director or other official and ultimately with the voters at election time. 
 
2-13-1.3.  Principles. 
 
(a) City officials must obey the laws of the State of Arkansas and the city of Hot Springs in spirit as well as by letter. 
 
(b) Decisions must be based on principles, the fundamental truths established by society. 
 
(c) Principle must never be sacrificed for expedience or for profit, whether that profit be monetary or for the inflation of the individual ego. 
 
(c) No city office should be used for financial or gratuitous enrichment.

 CODE OF ETHICS 
 
 
(e) A spirit of cooperation and teamwork among city officials is essential to the effective management of government.  Therefore, all city officials should:

(2) Seek to eliminate that ingrained sense of competition among directors and other officials that is so detrimental to the win-win concept for the city as a whole;

(4) Invest in workshops and other training that will serve to teach and foster the value of teamwork and courtesy to all city officials; 
 
(5) Show respect and courtesy to all those who work  in government and to the public which city governments seek to serve; 
 
(f) Officials should never seek to demean or embarrass a fellow official or employee but must always reserve the right and obligation to clearly state opinions on any issue. 
 
(g) A primary goal for all officials should be to timely and respectfully communicate to the citizens they serve and one another. 
 
(h) All officials must carry out the duties of office in an efficient and prudent manner. 
 
(I) All city officials must never violate the trust placed in them by the citizens of Hot Springs. 
 
(j) Officials should believe the best about others, listen with empathy, focus on the positive and provide constructive feedback. 
 
(k) Officials should not disclose to others, or use to further their personal interest, confidential information acquired by them in the course of their official duties.  In this regard, purchases and sales of property or other investments which might be interpreted as a speculation for quick profit should be avoided. 
 
(l) No official should represent any outside interest before the board of directors without first disclosing such interest. 
 
(m) Officials should not seek or accept a gift of value which could be intended to influence them in the performance of official duties.

  (4) The commission may sue to the same effect and extent as for the enforcement of a right of action for debt.

5-2-32.  Settlement or compromise of liability controversies. 
 
 (a) The commission may enter into an agreement to compound, settle, or compromise any controversy relating to the A&P tax when: 
 
 (1) The controversy is over the amount of tax due; or

 (b) The commission may waive or remit the interest or penalty, or any portion thereof, ordinarily accruing because of a taxpayer=s failure to pay the A&P tax within the statutory period allowed for its payment

 (2) Adequate security deposit is made with the commission to secure the payment of the debt evidenced by the lien. 
 
 (b) When the commission determines that its assessment, certificate of indebtedness, or judgment is clouding the title of property because of an error in the description of properties or similarity in names, the commission may issue a release without the payment of any consideration.

 (1) The amount of privilege or occupation tax assessed by this ordinance in regard to the particular classification in which the taxpayer is classified, or 
 
 (2) Complaints regarding a mis-classification of the taxpayer. 
 
 (b) An aggrieved taxpayer who feels that the tax rate for his business classification is excessive, or that he has been mis-classified in accordance with the business, occupation, profession, or calling in which he is actually engaged, may file a written complaint with the Hot Springs City Manager or his designee.  The City Manager or his designee shall place the matter on the board of directors=  meeting agenda in accordance with the board=s agenda rules and procedures.  The aggrieved taxpayer shall then appear in person and present all relevant facts concerning his complaint.  After the complaining party and appropriate city officials have been heard, the board shall then, by majority vote, either: 
 
 (1) Determine that the rate set for the business classification involved be reduced, increased or remain the same, or that 
 
 (2) The taxpayer receive a different business classification than the one currently imposed. 
 
 Under no circumstances, however, shall the board reduce or increase a rate in regard to an  isolated taxpayer without taking full cognizance of all other persons within a given  business classification.  Any such rate adjustments shall be by ordinance amending the  occupation tax ordinance to be considered at a subsequent meeting of the board of  directors.

In line with this policy, the board of directors is hereby empowered to review any complaint from any aggrieved taxpayer in regard to multiple business classifications, and if it is found that the person, firm or corporation has a classification for a business or profession which is customarily carried on by this business or profession in accordance with the usage of his trade or profession, the board of directors shall be empowered to remove such classifications that are found to be cumulative.

 The following rates and charges are hereby established for the City of Hot Springs Wastewater (Sewer) System, hereinafter termed “System,” and this ordinance shall be known as the Hot Springs Wastewater Rate Ordinance 
 
9-3-1.1.  Rates established.   
 
 The City hereby establishes as rates to be charged for services furnished by the System, which the Board of Directors finds and declares to be fair, reasonable, and necessary, to be charged to all users who contribute wastewater to the System.  The proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of operating and maintaining the System, including replacement (“OM&R”) and debt service as specified hereinafter.  (Replacement is defined as expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories, or appurtenances during the useful life of the treatment works necessary to maintain the capacity and performance for which they were designed and constructed.)  In order to provide for the cost of service differentials between System customers within the corporate limits of Hot Springs and those outside the corporate limits, a separate rate shall be established for “Inside-City” and “Outside-City” customers.  All wastewater users shall be classified by the Board of Directors as residential, commercial, or industrial.  None of the facilities or services afforded by the System shall be furnished without a charge being made therefore.

 WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
 
 
9-3-2.3.  Legislative findings. 
 
 The board of directors of Hot Springs, Arkansas, finds, determines and declares that: 
 
 (a) System expansion required.  The protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city requires that the city’s capital sewer facilities be expanded and improved to accommodate growth and development within the city and the system service area. 
 
 (b) System demand.  New residential and nonresidential development imposes increased and excessive demands upon the existing system facilities and often overburdens the existing system facilities.  Provided, further, new development is expected to continue, and will place ever-increasing demands on the system to provide these facilities to serve new development. 
 
 (c) System revenues.  System revenues generated from new development often does not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary capital sewer facilities to accommodate new development; therefore, the creation of an equitable wastewater impact fee system would enable the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of the needed improvements to system capital facilities to accommodate new development. 
 
 (d) Study conducted.  In order to implement an equitable wastewater impact fee system, the city has caused to be  prepared a “Wastewater Impact Fee Study,” hereinafter termed “study.”  Said study is incorporated herein by reference, and sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of development on the city’s system capital facilities, and for determining the cost of acquiring the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such services created by new development. 
 
 (e) Standards established.  The city hereby establishes as city standards the assumptions and level of service (LOS) standards referenced in the study as part of its current plans for future expansions to the city’s system capital facilities. 
 
 (f) Impact fee use limited.  The impact fees described in this ordinance are based on the study, and do not exceed the costs of improvements to serve new development that will pay the impact fees nor shall such fees be used to correct existing deficiencies for these capital facilities, or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements. 
 
 (g) Benefit.  All of the capital wastewater facilities listed in the study will benefit all new development that depends on city services, and it is therefore appropriate to treat the entire system as a single service area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and spending the impact fees.

 WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
 
 
 (h) Impact fee relationship.  There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this ordinance and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay. 
 
 (i) Impact fee purposes.  This ordinance creates a system by which wastewater impact fees paid by new development will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements for system’s capital wastewater facilities in ways that benefit the development that paid each fee within a reasonable period of time after the fee is paid. 
 
9-3-2.4.  Intent. 
 
 (a) Capital improvement plan.  This ordinance is adopted to assist in the implementation of the city’s capital improvement plan (CIP) for wastewater system projects.  To that end, the intent of this ordinance is to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to capital wastewater facilities; to ensure that such proportionate share does not exceed the cost of improvements for capital wastewater facilities required to accommodate new development; and to ensure that funds collected from new development are actually used for improvements for capital wastewater facilities that benefit such new development. 
 
 (b) Impact fee purpose.  It is the further intent of this ordinance that new development pay for its fair share of the cost of improvements for capital wastewater facilities required to accommodate new development through the imposition of an impact fee that will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city to construct improvements to the city capital wastewater facilities that serve or benefit such new development.  It is not the intent of this ordinance to collect any money from any new development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset new demands for capital wastewater facilities. 
 
 (c) Funds restricted.  It is not the intent of this ordinance that any monies collected from any impact fee deposited in the wastewater impact fee trust fund ever be commingled with monies from  any other city trust fund or account, or ever be used for a type of facility or equipment different from that for which the fees are paid, or are ever used to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements. 
 
9-3-2.5.  Impact fee imposed. 
 
 (a) Impact fee obligation. After the effective date of this ordinance, any person, firm or corporation who commences any development, except those exempted hereinafter, shall be obligated to pay impact fees upon commencement of such activity.  The amount of the fees shall be determined in accordance with this ordinance, and shall be paid to the city as provided hereinafter.  All monies paid by a developer pursuant to this ordinance shall be identified as impact fees and shall be promptly deposited into the wastewater trust fund described hereinafter.

 (b) Impact fee collection.  The impact fee imposed by this ordinance shall be collected in connection with and as a condition to the installation of a water meter serving the development.  Should there not be water service to the development, the impact fee will be collected at the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  For those developments located outside the corporate limits of Hot Springs that are not served by water, the certificate of occupancy shall be limited to the development’s wastewater system. 
 
 (c) Impact fee calculation.  Impact fees shall be based on water meter size.  Where no water meter is present, the utilities director shall determine and assign a water meter size equivalent based on a comparison with similarly-sized developments that are on metered service.  The impact fees established hereinafter may be revised from time to time by the board of directors based on a new or revised impact fee study.

 (e) Impact fee correction.  If an impact fee has been calculated and paid based on a mistake or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated.  Any amounts overpaid by a developer shall be refunded by the city within thirty (30) days after the city’s acceptance of the recalculated amount, with accrued interest since the date of such overpayment.  Any amounts underpaid by the developer shall be paid to the city within thirty (30) days after the city’s acceptance of the recalculated amount, with accrued interest since the date of such underpayment.  In the case of an underpayment to the city, the city shall not issue any additional permits or approvals for the project for which the impact fee was previously paid until such underpayment is corrected, and if amounts owed to the city are not paid within such thirty (30) day period, the city may also rescind any permits issued in reliance on the previous payment of such impact fee and refund such fee to the then current owner of the land.

(a) Except as indicated in Sections (b) and (c) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority representative.  Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority representative, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority representative as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
 
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
 
 (c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day compliance reports required in Sections 9.3.47.1 and 9-3-47.3 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority representative may authorize a lower minimum.  For the reports required by paragraphs Section 9-3-47.3 [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
 
9-3-47.12.  Timing. 
 
 Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.  For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
 
9-3-47.13.  Record keeping. 
 
 Users subject to the reporting requirements of this code shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this code and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under Section 9-3-43.4.  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.

9-3-51.1.  Notification of violation. 
 
 When the control authority representative finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority representative may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.  Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control authority representative.  Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.  Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority representative to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
 
9-3-51.2.  Consent orders. 
 
 The control authority representative may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.  Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 9-3-51.4 and 9-3-51.5 of this code and shall be judicially enforceable.

 The control authority representative may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any  other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the control authority representative and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.  Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user.  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
 
9-3-51.4.  Compliance orders. 
 
 When the control authority representative finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority representative may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.  If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.  Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer.  A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.

9-3-52.4.  Remedies nonexclusive.  
 
 The remedies provided for in this code are not exclusive. The control authority representative may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.  Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan.  However, the control authority representative may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.  Further, the control authority representative may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.  Further, the control authority representative is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.  
 
9-3-53.  Affirmative defenses to discharge violators. 
 
9-3-53.1.  Upset. 
 
(a) For the purpose of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.   
 
(b) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
 
(c) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:   
 (1) An upset occurred and the users can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
 
 (2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
 
 (3) The user has submitted the following information to the control authority representative within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days:   
 
  a. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;   
 
  b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Title 9 . Page 108  Supplement No. 36 
9-3-53.1 HOT SPRINGS CODE 9-3-53.3 
 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
 
 
  c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.   
 
(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.   
 
(e) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.   
 
(f) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.   
 
9-3-53.2.  Prohibited discharge standards. 
 
 A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 9-3-43.1(a) of this  code or the specific prohibitions of this code if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:  
 
 (a) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or   
 
 (b) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.   
 
9-3-53.3.  Bypass.  
 
 (a) For the purposes of this section,  
 
 (1) “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastewater from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.   
 
 (2) “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonable be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.   
 
 
 
 
 
 Supplement No. 36  Title 9 . Page 109 
9-3-53.3 HOT SPRINGS CODE 9-3-60 
 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
 
 (b) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.   
 
 (c)  
 
 (1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority representative, at least ten (l0) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.   
 
 (2) A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority representative of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The control authority representative may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.   
 
 (d)  
 
 (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority representative may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless  
 
  a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;   
 
  b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and  
 
  c. The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.   
 
 (2) The control authority representative may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority representative determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

9-5-2. Cost recovery. 
 
 The following regulations and procedures shall govern the recovery of costs associated with water and wastewater line extensions. 
 
 (a) Purpose. The intent of this policy is to define the circumstances under which a developer may recover a portion of the cost of installing water and/or wastewater facilities from subsequent developers who may utilize all or part of the improvements. It also establishes the procedure for determining, collecting and distributing such recoveries. 
 
 (b) Definitions.  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this sub-section, unless the context of their usage clearly indicates another meaning: 
 
Applicant – Developers, their successors and assigns, who are seeking recovery for water and/or wastewater facilities costs from subsequent developers. 
 
  City - City of Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
 
Developer – An individual, group of individuals, improvement district, business or corporation responsible for the initial construction of water and/or wastewater facilities or any individual, group of individuals, improvement district, business or corporation who desires to connect to such facilities constructed by others. 
 
 Utility – City of Hot Springs Water and Wastewater Utilities Department. 
  
 (c) Qualifications.  In order for an applicant to be entitled to recover a portion of initial construction costs for water and/or wastewater facilities through a cost recovery agreement, the applicant must meet the following requirements. 
 
(1) Water distribution mains shall be a minimum size of six inches (6”) in diameter unless otherwise approved by the utilities director and/or the utilities engineer.  Water extensions of two inches (2”) in diameter or larger which are 100 feet or more in length, or provide service to more than one meter, will be subject to plan approval by the utility and the Arkansas Department of Health. 
 
(2) Wastewater pressure main extensions of two inches (2”) in diameter or larger which are 100 feet or more in length, or provide service to more than one customer, will be subject to plan approval by the utility and the Arkansas Department of Health. 
 
(3) Wastewater gravity mains shall be a minimum size of eight inches (8”) in diameter, unless otherwise approved by the utilities director and/or utilities engineer.  Wastewater gravity main extensions of six inches (6”) in diameter or larger which are 100 feet or more in length, or provide service to more than one customer, will be subject to plan approval by the utility and the Arkansas Department of Health

 UTILITIES EXTENSION AND CONNECTION REGULATIONS 
 
.   
 
  (4) All construction, cleanup and required system testing must be satisfactorily completed and evidence of such completion filed with the utility. 
 
  (5) As-built drawings and actual construction cost statements must have been received and field checked for accuracy by the utility as evidenced by an acceptance letter from the utility.  
 
  (6) All easements and/or street right-of-way dedications must have been filed with the Garland County Circuit Clerk’s Office and copies provided to the utility.  
 
  (7) All recoveries owed by applicant to other previous developers as a result of installation of new facilities must be paid in full. 
 
(8) Applicant must state his intentions by requesting that a cost recovery agreement be granted by the utility prior to construction of facilities in order to determine the number of possible future connections and estimate the cost for each.  A developer who does not address these issues prior to construction is considered to have waived his or her rights for any cost recovery from subsequent connections to such construction. 
 
  (9) Cost recovery will only be granted on direct service connections to the water or wastewater main constructed by applicant and will be paid on a per-parcel or per-lot basis.  There will be no cost recovery for connection or extension of water mains 6” or larger serving single lots or developments that cannot be directly served by the constructed mains.  If the utility absorbs the expense of up-sizing the line, the developer will only be entitled to cost recovery related to the design capacity of the line needed to serve his development.  The developer would not be entitled to cost recovery for the additional capacity paid for by the utility.  There will be no cost recovery for lines sized 2” or less.

9-5-3. Water/sewer extensions within Mid-America Park-Policy. 
 
 The following water/sewer extension policy is hereby adopted: 
 
 (a) The city and Garland County Industrial Development Corporation (GCIDC) hereby pledge to work together to attract new industries to locate in the Mid-America Industrial Park.  The city will assist such industries with extension of water and sewer services according to the terms and conditions listed in this resolution. 
 
 (b) Whenever such industries approach GCIDC seeking assistance with extension of water and sewer services, GCIDC and the city will attempt to obtain grant funding to pay for such extension. 
 
 (c) If the city and GCIDC are not successful in obtaining such outside funding, the city will provide the costs for water and sewer extension to the property line based upon the following: 
 
  (1) That such cost will be provided by the city, based upon the industry’s creation of net new full-time jobs totaling 10 during the first 24 months of operation. 
 
  (2) That, if such jobs are not provided during the first 24 months of operation, the industry will reimburse the city at a rate of $2,000 per employee for each net new full-time employee (under 10) that the industry has not provided. 
 
  
  (3) That such reimbursement will not, in any case, exceed the actual city costs for extension of such services.  That any reimbursement due may be pro-rated over a 12-month period and billed to industry monthly.  Failure to pay the monthly assessment shall result in disconnection of the industry’s municipal water service.  Water service disconnection/re-connection, and costs thereof, shall be accomplished in accordance with the applicable provisions of the uniform municipal utility billing procedure ordinance (Title 9, Chapter 6). 
 
(4) That for any industry providing less than 10 net new full-time jobs, the city and GCIDC will negotiate the cost share for water and sewer line extensions considering the type of industry, total jobs and other factors.

 The utility billing section shall provide each municipal utility customer a combined monthly municipal utility bill which shall include the charges incurred by the customer for regular monthly water, wastewater, sanitation, and/or stormwater services or any combination thereof, plus any fees, penalties or previous balances.  Each municipal utility shall be designated as a separate entry on the billing statement.  Bills for municipal utility services provided shall be rendered and paid monthly. (Ord.

Provided, however, that the city manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to waive the “late charge” on the current month’s municipal utility bill on a case-by-case basis for municipal utility customers whose principal income is from one of the following sources received on a once-per-month basis:  social security, retirement plan, disability income, or state or federal income assistance programs.  Persons desiring waiver of the monthly late charge must apply annually in writing to the appropriate city department on such form and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by the department.  Provided, further, that the applicant's total annual income from all sources shall not exceed the “low income limits” as published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

 Any customer whose current bill contains a balance which remains unpaid beyond the past due date shall be considered delinquent; provided further, any account with an unpaid balance greater than fifty-five (55) days from any billing date shall be subject to service disconnection. Any customer who is delinquent on any one municipal utility (water, wastewater, sanitation, and/or stormwater services) or any combination thereof may be disconnected from the municipal water system and, once disconnected, shall not be reconnected or reinstated until payment, or arrangement of payment, of all charges, fees, deposit and penalties necessary to

bring the account(s) to a current status has been made. Any delinquent municipal wastewater,  
and/or sanitation customer not on the municipal water system may be disconnected or discontinued from the municipal wastewater and/or sanitation system and, once disconnected or discontinued, shall not be reinstated until payment or arrangement of payment, of all charges, fees, deposit and penalties necessary to bring the account(s) to a current status has been made.  The city may also refer delinquent customers to a collection agency or attorney for collection on a case-by-case basis. (Ord.No. 6032, §1, 6-17-2014) 
 
9-6-1.8.  Municipal utility service application. 
 
 Any person, firm or corporation desiring to establish any municipal utility or combination thereof shall make application for said service(s).

The application shall include the name, mailing address, service location, personal identification number (e.g., social security number or driver’s license number) or federal identification number (businesses) and signature of the party responsible for payment.

Each service location shall be considered a separate account. 
 
9-6-1.9.  Utility deposit. 
 
 (a) Utility deposit generally.  Utility deposits shall be required of municipal utility customers in accordance with the provisions of this section. Utility deposits shall be maintained in a separate account and held as security for the payment of municipal utility bills.  The utility deposit once so established shall be considered a combined utility deposit for the benefit of any and all municipal utilities received by the customer.  Utility deposits shall not be required for federal, state or local government agencies.  Utility deposits may not be transferred from one customer to another and must be carried in the name of the person, firm or corporation for whom the service is rendered.  In the case of multi-accounts by a single customer, each service location shall be considered a separate account for deposit purposes. 
 
 (b) Residential customer deposit.  All residential customers who establish water, wastewater and/or sanitation service shall be required to provide a utility deposit as follows: 
 
(1) Initial deposit.  The residential customer’s initial deposit shall be based on the customer’s credit rating as follows: 
 
Credit Rating* 
 Deposit Required 
 
good to excellent 
 initial deposit waived

9-6-1.9 HOT SPRINGS CODE 9-6-1.10 
 UTILITY BILLING PROCEDURE 
 
 
 (2) Letter in lieu of deposit.  The initial deposit will be waived for any residential customer who can provide a letter of recommendation from another water/wastewater utility demonstrating that the customer had at least 12 consecutive months of service in good standing within the past 24 months with said utility.  Customers with less than 24 months of immediate past history with their former municipal utility will not be eligible for this deposit option. 
 
 (c) Commercial deposit.  All commercial or non-residential customers must provide an initial deposit for any new accounts or new service locations regardless of the number of accounts or payment history.  Provided, however, that the initial deposit may be waived or reduced based on an account evaluation criteria to be established by the city manager, or his designee and approved by the city manager. 
 
 (d) Deposit application--Service termination.  In the case of default on the utility bill resulting from the termination of service, the utility deposit shall be credited to any unpaid balance on such bill.  The total utility deposit shall be applied to each utility based on its balance relative to the total bill.  If a delinquent customer, whose service has been disconnected, is reinstated prior to the account being closed, the amount, if any, then on deposit, may be applied toward the reconnect deposit.  
 
 (e) Reconnect deposit.  Prior to the restoration of municipal utility service, any customer whose service has been disconnected or discontinued due to non-payment shall be subject to the following deposit based on the number of service termination occurrences within the customer’s most recent twenty-four (24) months’ billing history: 
 
 First occurrence -- an initial deposit; 
 
 Second (or more) occurrence(s) -- the initial deposit plus an amount equal to the average of the monthly charges for the customer’s most recent three months (total of past three months current charges divided by three).

9-7-1.2.  Purpose. 
 
 The purpose of this section is to comply with 16 CFR § 681.2 in order to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that will prevent identity theft.

 The Federal Trade Commission “FTC” requires every utility, including public water and wastewater systems, such as the City of Hot Springs Municipal Utilities, to implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program (ITPP). The FTC requirements and regulations are necessary because of § 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).  The FTC has set forth the ITPP requirement in 16 CFR § 681.2.  Identity theft is defined as fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority.  The City of Hot Springs adopts the program set forth in this chapter to comply with FTC rules and regulations.  In drafting its ITPP, the city has considered:  (1) the methods it provides to open accounts; (2) the methods it provides to access its accounts; and (3) its previous experiences with identity theft.  Based on these considerations, the Board of Directors hereby determines that the City of Hot Springs Municipal Utility is a low to moderate risk entity, and as a result develops and implements the streamlined ITPP set forth hereto.  Further, the city determines that the only covered accounts offered by the city are those under its water, wastewater, sanitation and stormwater utilities. 
 
9-7-1.5.  Red flags. 
 
 The FTC regulations identify numerous red flags that must be considered in adopting an ITPP.  The FTC has defined a red flag as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.  Any time a red flag or a situation closely resembling a red flag is apparent, it should be investigated for verification.  The city identifies the following red flags from the examples provided in the regulations of the FTC: 
 
 (a) Notifications from Consumer Reporting Agencies: 
 
(1) Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency;   
 
(2) A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;

10-8-7.1.  Speed hump policy - Purpose. 
 
 The purpose of this policy is to provide for the installation of speed humps to calm traffic along neighborhood streets.  Speed humps will be designed to meet the needs of a particular situation; and the actual features, spacing, layout and other elements of the overall design will be determined by the particular circumstances of the case under consideration.  This policy is designed to provide reasonable opportunities for the installation of speed humps on specified types of residential streets based upon technical criteria, the degree of support from the residents along the proposed street, and the street conditions. 
 
10-8-7.2.  Speed hump policy - Eligibility requirements.  
 
 In order for a street to be considered for speed hump installation, the street on which the speed hump is proposed must meet the following technical requirements: 
 
(a) The proposed street must not be classified as an arterial street as specified in the most recent edition of the City of Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance; 



 
(b) The proposed street should have no more than two traveling lanes, one in each direction, and not greater than 42 feet in width; 



 
(c)      Traffic volumes on the proposed street must be more than 500 vehicles per day (vpd), but less than 1,500 vehicles per day (vpd); 



 
(d)     The proposed street shall have a posted or prima facie speed limit of 35 mph or less, as determined in accordance with state law; 



 
(e)     Street grades shall be eight percent (8%) or less approaching the hump; 



 
(f)     The 85th percentile speed of the traveling traffic on the proposed street must be equal to or greater than 10 mph over the posted or prima facie speed limit and a minimum 85th percentile of 38 mph.  The 85th percentile speed means  the speed at or below which 85 percent of the vehicles are traveling, as determined by a speed study;

 (g) The street must not be an identified primary route for emergency response by local police, fire or EMS services; and 
 
(h) If approved, the location guidelines as specified in Section 6 hereof could be met. 
 
10-8-7.3.  Speed hump policy - Application.   
 
 An individual resident(s) or Neighborhood Association(s), hereinafter termed applicant, can initiate a request for the installation or removal of a speed hump along a street within their neighborhood.  An application request must be submitted in writing on such form(s) as may be prescribed by the Traffic Review Committee.  The application shall include the signatures from at least five (5) additional households or addresses along the proposed street or intersecting streets within immediate vicinity of the proposed site.  Installation or removal may also be initiated by the City Manager, City Engineer or Traffic Review Committee.  Installation or removal initiated by City officials shall comply with all other aspects of this policy. 
 
10-8-7.4.  Speed hump policy - Application evaluation.   
 
 Once a properly completed application has been received, the traffic review committee will initiate the following evaluation process: 
 
(a) The traffic review committee will review the application in order to determine if the          proposed street segment meets the eligibility requirements.  If the application does not meet the basic eligibility requirements, the evaluation process will be terminated; and the applicant will be notified in writing that eligibility requirements are not met.  If the application meets the basic eligibility requirements, the traffic review committee shall so notify the applicant and request that the applicant submit a “neighborhood support petition.” The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the City.  The neighborhood support petition must be signed by at least one adult representative from not less than sixty  percent (60%) of the households in the affected neighborhood and must be submitted to the traffic review committee within sixty (60) days from the date of the City’s eligibility determination notice.  For purposes of this policy, “affected neighborhood” means all  households located or situated in proximity to the proposed speed hump location such that  the most convenient direction of travel from the household to the nearest highway, arterial street, or major collector street would require that the residents thereof routinely traverse  the proposed speed hump.  The traffic review committee shall determine the affected neighborhood based on the above definition and shall provide the applicant with a map illustrating the affected neighborhood.  The boundaries of the affected neighborhood may be reasonably modified by the traffic review committee to meet the intention of this policy based on actual street configuration (e.g., breaking local street segments that  exceed 1,000 feet from the proposed speed hump location in either direction, etc.). 


 
(b) Once a completed application and neighborhood support petition have been received, the  traffic review committee shall provide notice to the neighborhood by regular mail or hand   delivery.

by Barnard Dunkelberg & Company and dated February 2001, which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.*  An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
 
(a) Utility runway, visual approach zone:  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty (250) feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface.  Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway. 
 
(b) Runway larger than utility, visual approach zone:  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway. 
 
(c) Precision instrument runway approach zone:  The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide.  The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the primary surface.  Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway. 
 
(d) Transitional zones:  The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
 
(e) Horizontal zone:  The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand (5,000) feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and ten thousand (10,000) feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.  The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zone. 
 
(f) Conical zone: The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. (Ord. No. 3524, § 3, 9-10-79; Ord. No. 4994, §1(b), 8-6-01)

Such applicable height limitations are hereby established as being the applicable approach, transitional, horizontal, or conical surface above the particular zone.  Such applicable surfaces, or height limitations, as depicted on the Memorial Field Zoning Map, are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
 
(a) Utility runway, visual approach zone:  Height limitations slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extended to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway center line. 
 
(b) Runway larger than utility, visual approach zone:  Height limitation slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway center line. 
 
(c) Precision instrument runway approach zone:  Height limitation slopes fifty (50) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet along the extended runway center line; thence slopes upward forty (40) feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of forty thousand (40,000) feet along the extended runway center line. 
 
(d) Transitional zones:  Height limitation slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the side of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is five hundred fifty-four (544) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the side of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the extended runway center line.

(j) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as  ¾ mile non-precision instrument approach zone:  Slopes thirty-four (34) feet outward for each foot upward beginning a the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. (Ord. No. 4994, §1(a), 8-6-01) 


 
11-1-17.  Use restriction. 
 
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. (Ord. No. 3524, § 5, 9-10-79) 
 
11-1-18.  Nonconforming uses. 
 
 (a) Regulations not retroactive.  The regulations prescribed in this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this article, and is diligently prosecuted.

 (b) Marking and lighting.  Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city planning commission to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction.  Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city of Hot Springs. (Ord. No. 3524, § 6, 9-10-79) 
 
11-1-19.  Permits. 
 
 (a) Future uses.  Except as specifically provided in (1), (2) and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularly to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) below. 
 
(1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
 
(2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
 
(3) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of the vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
 
 Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this Ordinance except as set forth in subsection (d) below. 
 
 (b) Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.

 (c) Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed.  Whenever the Hot Springs Planning Commission determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
 
 (d) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of zoning adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of zoning adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance.  If the airport manager does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of zoning adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
 
 (e) Obstruction marking and lighting.  Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in questions to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such marking and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of zoning adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the city of Hot Springs, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. (Ord. No. 3524, § 7, 9-10-79) 
 
11-1-20. Enforcement. 
 
 It shall be the duty of the city planning commission to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances required by this article shall be filed with the city planning department on forms published for these purposes. (Ord. No. 3524, § 8, 9-10-79) 
 
11-1-21. Board of zoning adjustment. 
 
The board of zoning adjustment shall have and exercise the following power: 
 
(a) To hear and decide the special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance upon which such board of zoning adjustment under such regulations may be required to pass. 
 
 (b) To hear and decide specific variances.

12-2-6. Street naming and property numbering guide. 
 
The following street naming and property numbering guide is hereby adopted: 
 
(a) Introduction 
 
On November 8, 1988, the citizens of Hot Springs and Garland County approved the 911 emergency services program.  Proper implementation of this program requires the use of a standardized and consistent street naming and numbering system.  The principles and procedures enumerated hereinafter were developed to accomplish this purpose.  In addition to the needs of our emergency services personnel, the street location and identification concerns of our citizens, visitors and tourists, and the U.S. Postal Service were evaluated.  The system was developed without regard to jurisdictional boundaries as such boundaries can change through the years.  The system is continuous along major thoroughfares to the county lines. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 23 Title 12 . Page 3 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
Implementation of these principles will require the renaming and renumbering of some existing streets.  In establishing these initial principles, substantial effort was made to honor local history and tradition by not creating circumstances requiring the changing of well known or historical street names.  Preservation of all names, however, is not possible due to the existence of duplication, poor name selection and misapplication of names (e.g., Main Street in south Hot Springs). 
 
These rules have general applicability and shall be used when reviewing proposed new street names as well as required renaming.  It is also anticipated that occurrences will arise when strict application of these principles would be detrimental to the general public for whom they are designed to assist and protect.  In such cases common sense and public necessity should prevail. 
 
This document is the combined work of the Hot Springs board of directors, city staff, the Garland County emergency services coordinator, fire service volunteers, U.S. Postal Service, ambulance service and the 911 consulting engineer.  It is based in part on a similar work published by the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission in Pulaski County. 
 
(b) General Principles of Street Naming 
 
Several street naming principles should be followed in the Hot Springs area, affected communities and planned developments. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 1.  Standard Elements.  Establish a standard street or road name which shall consist of the following three parts; directional prefix, principle name (simple or compound) and a suffix (thoroughfare designation).  Through streets should use suffix identifiers denoting traffic classes. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 2.  Avoid duplication.  There should be no duplication of street names or numbers used as principle names among an incorporated area.  Incorporated areas in Garland County are Hot Springs, Mountain Pine and Lonsdale.  Hot Springs Village and Diamondhead are planned developments that should follow these same guidelines.  The remaining portions of the county will be treated as one incorporated area and should have no duplication of names.  If, for example, Hot Springs and Hot Springs Village both have a Cherokee Drive, one must be changed; however, if Hot Springs and Mountain Pine both have a Ouachita Avenue, then both can remain since they are in separate incorporated areas. 
 
Note:  Due to the predominance or exclusive use of Spanish names in the Hot Springs Village development, the use of similarly derived names in the balance of the county and in the city is discouraged and duplication shall not be permitted. 
 
 
 
Title 12 . Page 4 Supplement No. 23 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
An exception to the duplication rule will allow a branching street or cul-de-sac to have the same name as the street from which it originates.  In this case, a suffix would be used to differentiate between the street of origin and a branching street.  Branch suffix designations such as "place", "circle", "loop", "court" or "trail" may be used in the same manner but only where near waterfront properties. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 3.  Avoid confusion.  Street names that sound very similar or offer only a variation in spelling, should be avoided (i.e., Cherry and Cheery, Lynwood and Linwood).  Compound principle names shall not be duplicated even if written as one word versus two words, e.g., Pinewood vs. Pine Wood or Mary Lou vs. Marylou. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 4.  Establish continuity.  A street running in one direction should have one name only and should have the same name throughout its entire length.  However, if a street jogs sharply, 90 degrees or more, for a distance of more than 315 feet, successive portions of the street should be given a different name.  However, there are many streets that run for long distances, and/or change direction radically which have had their name for many years.  In such cases renaming all sections that change direction even when the directional change exceeds 90 degrees and 315 feet is not required unless there is a compelling public safety reason to do so.  The suffix "Drive" or "Road" may be used in such cases to denote the meandering nature of such streets. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 5.  Base line extensions.  Streets that cross the baselines may continue across baselines but should be designated east-west or north-south or change names.  Therefore, if a "north" prefix occurs, it should be matched with the street bearing a "south" prefix, (e.g., North Patterson and South Patterson).  A typical exception would be West Mountain Drive where "West" is part of the principle name.  However, the use of directional words as principle names should be avoided whenever possible. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 6.  Interrupted streets.  Streets that are permanently interrupted by parks, cemeteries, platted and developed land should have separate names attached to the segments, even though they line up geographically.  If the land block interruption is not platted or developed such that the road could continue in the future, the street name may be continued. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 7.  Intersections.  Street names should not change at intersections where there is no offset unless crossing a baseline or major geographical boundary.

 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
(c) Prefixes and Suffixes 
 
Address prefixes are words preceding a street name and indicating a direction such as north, south, east and west.  Address suffixes are words following a street name and may indicate only a type of street.  The latter type of suffix is also called a thoroughfare designation.  Attachment A contains a list of authorized suffix designations and their corresponding abbreviations and usage groupings.  Streets are sometimes ranked by function and size, and each category is assigned a specific name suffix (thoroughfare designation) accordingly. 
 
Editor's note: Attachment A has been amended by Resolution No. 6424 dated 11-6-06 which adopts the Postal Service Standard Suffix Abbreviations as published by the U.S. Postal Service and is on file in the office of the city clerk. 
 
The following is a list of definitions with synonyms that are permitted to be used throughout the city, and general rules for suffix usage: 
 
Boulevard.  A street with a median reflecting the boulevard character implied in the name.  Unusually wide thoroughfares in residential sections with shade trees or shrubbery in the center plot and the name can even be used with numbered thoroughfares.  Synonyms are parkway, expressway. 
 
Circle.  A circle is a secondary road that begins and circles back to terminate on the same road, street or drive.  "Square" may be used if applicable to the geometry of the street layout as part of the principle name but "Square" may not be used as a suffix. 
 
Court.  Permanently closed streets such as cul-de-sacs or a minor street less than 1000 feet in length, ending in a turnaround.  Synonyms are place, plaza, point, cove, trail. 
 
Drive.  Winding thoroughfares or curving streets longer than 1,000 feet with intersecting roads, streets and drives.  Roads that meander about and continue through to other rights-of-way.  Synonyms are avenue, way, street, road, cut-off. 
 
Highway.  Designated and numbered street or federal highways. 
 
Interstate.  Roads of the highest order characterized by limited access.  Synonyms are freeway, expressway, thruway, turnpike. 
 
Lane.  Private rights-of-way, streets or roads not maintained as public streets by the city of Hot Springs.  Other authorized suffixes may be used in lieu of lane where such suffix is more appropriate or descriptive (e.g., cove, point, bay, etc.).  All private street signage shall bear the additional notation of "(pvt.)" as specified in ' 12-1-11 (c) (5) of the city's street acceptance policy; however, the "pvt." notation shall not be considered as a street name suffix. (Res. No. 2576, 1-22-91) 
 
 
Title 12 . Page 6 Supplement No. 28 
 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
Loop.  Loops shall be short drives that begin and end by intersecting upon itself and generally of a curving nature. 
 
Parkway.  (See also boulevard.)  A special scenic route or park drive designated by a name and generally a highway. 
 
Roads.  Limited thoroughfares that are frequently used, have moderate traffic volume, and run in any direction.  Secondary facilities generally connecting with a U. S. or state primary highway.  Synonyms are crossway, cutoff, street, avenue, drive, way. 
 
The standard suffixes, avenue, boulevard, causeway, cutoff, drive, road, street, way, etc. cannot be attached to a road that dead ends.  From the last branching road the following dead end suffixes are to be used:  court, place, plaza, trail, extension, tram and lane.  "Lane" shall be applied to a private roadway that is either undedicated or dedicated but unaccepted for city maintenance but which may become a public road in the future.  Once a "lane" is accepted by the city the "Lane" is dropped, and it becomes a regular street name without a suffix.  The suffix grouping for major roads includes expressway, freeway, highway, parkway, roadway, thruway and turnpike. 
 
The suffix names circle, terrace and loop are generally applied  to roads that either start, wind around and end on the same road or an adjacent road.  Loop is a road that starts and loops back on itself with platted or private property in the middle of the roadway.  If there is no private property in the middle of such a road, it is to be considered  as a regular cul-de-sac.  The loop can be in the form of a circle or square.  A terrace is a suffix that could apply to a dead end but generally applies to either a back access to lots that face in the opposite direction.  The suffixes point and cove are to be applied only in lake areas.  Suffixes should be applied only in accordance with these rules. 
 
(d) Naming Major Routes, Thoroughfares and Numbering Baselines 
 
(1) Major thoroughfare designations. 
 
The following thoroughfares shall be named as follows: 
 
 a. Albert Pike designation shall originate at Summer Street (Jewish Rest Cemetery) and continue to the Ouachita River Bridge past Treasure Isle Road. 
 
 b. Airport Road designation shall originate at the West Hwy. 70/West Hwy. 270 intersection junction and continue to the junction of Hwy. 227 (Sunshine Road).

h. Broadway shall commence at Bridge Street and continue to its intersection with East Grand Avenue. 
 
(2) Base Lines. 
 
For purposes of numbering streets, the following base lines are established and numbering shall generally increase in distance away from the base lines: 
 
a. The principle intersections shall be West Grand Avenue at Central Avenue.  The east base line shall be East Grand Avenue. 
 
b. The west base line shall be West Grand to Summer Street and Albert Pike west of Summer Street. 
 
c. The north base line shall be Park Avenue from Whittington. 
 
d. The south base line shall be Hot Springs Creek to Winona Street (MDGRR) and Central Avenue from Winona Street southward. 
 
e. Malvern Avenue shall be a supplementary base line for numbering streets in the southeast quadrant of the city.

(e) Property Numbering 
 
(1) General Principles. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 1.  Uniform.  Property numbering should be uniform, based generally on street frontage, providing at least one number for each 25 feet on either side of the street. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 2.  Consecutive.  Numbering should be consecutive away from major thoroughfares. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 3.  Even/Odd numbering.  Even numbers should always be on the right side of the road and odd numbers should be on the left side in the direction of ascending numbers and without regard to designated traffic flow on one-way streets. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 4.  Expansion.  The numbering system should allow for expansion to accommodate future growth. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 5.  City/County streets.  Roads beginning in the incorporated areas of the city and continuing into the county will be numbered continuously from its origin in the city continuing into the county.  The numbers will continue throughout the entire road at 25 foot intervals wherever practical but blocks shall not exceed 1/4 mile. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 6.  Number sequence.  Newly numbered roads will begin at 100 and will be numbered sequentially every 25 feet throughout with odd and even numbers on opposite sides of the street. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 7.  Single digit numbering.  Street numbers of less than three digits shall be prohibited on public streets.  Section (e)(3) "Private Developments" hereby pertains to the use of single and double digits in privately owned and operated developments. (Res. No. 2576, 1-22-91) 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 8.  Measurements.  When measuring roads to assign numbers, do not skip across streets on one side of a tee intersection only, utility easements, railroads, streams.  As time brings change, this method will assure that the numbers will be available to assign.  Vacant property shall not be assigned a number until it is developed.  At tee intersections in rural or unplatted land, there shall be a block change.  In urban and platted land, block numbers need not change across a tee intersection if the potential for making a thru street is greatly diminished by the existing conditions. 
 
 
 
Title 12 . Page 10 Supplement No. 23 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
    STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 9.  Vacant property.  In the event the land is platted into lots and blocks but vacant, each lot shall be numbered generally according to the 25-foot rule (100-feet-wide vacant lots could have 4-number spacing such as 16, 24, 32 and 40).  If the platted land is occupied, the number spacing should go by twos. 
 
PRINCIPLE NO. 10.   Name/Number assignment.  All street names and numbering schemes should be approved and assigned by the proper city official.  In newly platted developments, this shall be accomplished prior to all water or sewer connections.  All street names/numbers shall be assigned/approved before a plat is accepted for filing by the circuit clerk. 
 
(2) Group Buildings Numbering Principle. 
 
An example of numbering encountered in apartment complexes, shopping centers, or office parks is shown in the following illustration: 
 
 
One of the designation problems involves making a decision as to which of two streets to use in giving the unit an address when a corner location is encountered.  The building apartments, office or shopping centers are grouped around parking bays and the units or lots may actually face neither street.  The sketch shows how one case may be handled.  In the case of the residential building complex, the entire complex has only one number comprised of the block number and the front footage number (even or odd) falling closest to the entryway. 
 
 
Supplement No. 23 Title 12 . Page 11  


12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
Separate internal units of condominiums and apartments should have an alphabetical designation for a multi-unit building with sub-numbers for individual dwelling units.  The same consideration will apply to mobile home parks with the exception that the alphabetical designation for a multi-unit building would not be required.  Each mobile home should receive a numerical designation such as Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3 (or space A, B, C) in addition to the general number.  The end result is that the building complexes do not have street frontage numbers for each individual dwelling unit. 
 
As shown on the illustration, non-residential building complexes do have street frontage property numbers for each building, but have an alphabetical suffix for the individual units or suites. 
 
The distinction between residential and non-residential numbering is made due to a U. S. Postal Service policy concerning mail delivery.  For the residential complex, mail delivery is made to a central point but mail delivery is made to each unit or suite in a non-residential complex. 
 
A separate building (such as #2808 shown on sketch) will not be addressed off the side street unless accessed through a curb cut. 
 
(3) Private Developments. 
 
As stated above, private multifamily housing developments will be given a single address for the total complex such as a large condominium site, retirement village, mobile home park, or cluster of apartments.  The single address will be the official address with each occupancy being assigned a unit or space numbers (apt. 44) or a combination of building numbers - unit numbers (such as 8-6).  Space assignments shall consist of a number (less than 99) or a letter and a number. 
 
For the convenience of P.O.A. or management, streets or drives within the development may be named but such names shall not duplicate any other name within Garland County. 
 
If street names are referenced for convenience, all unit or space numbers shall be less than 99.  The official addresses shall be assigned by 911 operations.

        STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
(4) Number Assignments. 
 
The process of assigning numbers is as follows: 
 
a. Field work - measurements of houses and roads will be done in a systematic manner. 
 
b. Field work will be taken to office and house or building numbers will be assigned. 
 
c. The newly assigned addresses will be delivered to the residents as soon as possible in a package containing the occupant's new address, a change of address form, and a letter of explanation. 
 
(5) Base Maps. 
 
  Base maps used for the purpose of naming and numbering roads in Hot Springs/Garland County are: 
 
 a. General Highway Map of Garland County, Arkansas, prepared by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department, Revised 1988. 
  
 b. Transportation Boundary Map for Hot Springs, Garland County, Arkansas prepared by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department. 
 
 c. Other specifically prepared maps such as Atlas Sheets, improvement district ownership maps, aerial photogrammetry, or other reliable systems. 
 
(6) Private Drives. 
 
  Private drives are not usually considered for numbering purposes.  If access to a business or industrial establishment is not approached on any public street, the address is assigned using the interval where the drive joins the public street.  If principle access to the structure is from the private drive but is hidden behind other structures or is located on the interior of the block, the centerline of the driveway is used to assign the number. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 23 Title 12 . Page 13 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-6 
    STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
(7) Corner Lots. 
 
 The general rule to apply when assigning a number to a building on a corner lot is to assign a number from the street upon which the front entrance faces.  Dual addresses should not be assigned, a choice must be made.  If a corner building has two entrances, for one entity and both look like front entrances, the decision about which number to assign is based on the general site layout. 
 
 (8) Rear Houses and Buildings on Interior Lots. 
 
 For landlocked parcels having rear dwellings, a subordinate designation can be assigned that is alphabetical.  The only exception to the rule is that if a structure is hidden or plainly subsidiary or auxiliary in nature to a primary structure, or when there are two or more entrances to a separate unit of the same structure, each unit shall be duplicated alphabetically.  In all such cases, only one number should be assigned. 
  
 If there is a rear entrance or a hidden residential structure, a post should display the number on the path leading to the entrance, even if it is reached through another structure.  For units on alleys or interior malls where there is no access to a street paralleling the alley, the address number is assigned based on the intersection of that alley with the named street.  Numbers are assigned from the series on that street. 
 
 In the case of commercial or industrial facilities, auxiliary buildings would not be assigned separate numbers, but the main building - where the mail is received and business is transacted - would receive a building number. 
 
(f) System Implementation 
 
 The Hot Springs board of directors adopts this policy that effectuates the system, and that authorizes the city manager to administer the program.  The following is a list of steps to institute the system. 
 
(1) Street names are inventoried and reviewed for duplications, and thoroughfare designations, and prefix/suffix adjustments are made.  Unnamed streets and private streets are named. 
 
(2) Citizens are informed of the proposed changes that are under review. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Title 12 . Page 14 Supplement No. 23 
12-2-6 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-10 
 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
(3) Field measurements are taken and the numbering is recorded on the prepared maps. 
 
(4) The assignment of numbers to structures are made and the occupants are informed. 
 
(5) Notice of the new street and number changes are sent to all affected residences and businesses, city departments, the U. S. Postal Service, the public utilities, the newspapers, the sheriff's department and other appropriate agencies.  It is important that enough lead time be given so that residents and businesses can make appropriate changes in stationery, labels, advertising, etc. 
 
(6) As new streets are added in future years, this policy shall be applied on a case by case basis. 
 
(g) Conclusion 
 
 While these general principles and rules for numbering structures provide guidance in constructing a street naming and numbering system, it is not possible to develop rules for all of the problems that will be encountered in perfecting such a numbering system.  There is no substitute for good judgment in applying these guidelines.  (Res. No. 2524, ' 1, 5-21-90)

12-2-11.  Street acceptance policy. 
 
The following street acceptance policy is hereby adopted and shall govern the acceptance of streets as part of the official street system: 
 
(a) Purpose statement.  The primary mission of the city of Hot Springs in the area of streets and roads is the continued maintenance and reconstruction of the city's official street system.  To this end it is not the city's intention to engage in initial street construction.  However, it is the city's responsibility to continually upgrade those streets which are a part of the city's official public street system through an ongoing and consistent program as approved annually by the board of directors.  The following policies and procedures shall govern the methods and circumstances under which the city of Hot Springs shall accept streets for perpetual maintenance. 
 
(b) Definitions:  The following words and phrases have the following meanings for purpose of this policy: 
 
(1) Public Street.  A roadway open for the common use of all citizens not limited or restricted to any particular group.  "Public Streets" are either dedicated or prescription right-of-ways which have been accepted for perpetual maintenance by the board of directors. 
 
(2) Dedicated Street.  Specific right-of-way set apart by a property owner(s) for use as a public street by means of a recorded plat so designating the right-of-way.  "Dedicated Streets" are not "Public Streets" until accepted by the city (A.C.A. 14-301-102). 
 
(3) Prescription Street.  A roadway which has become a street due to open, continuous and exclusive use as a public right-of-way over a period of time as per Arkansas law. 
 
(4) Private Easement.  A roadway created by specific action or common consent of one or more property owners for their restricted enjoyment and use. 
 
(5) Private Driveway.  An entrance to one or more properties created by the owner(s) thereof for the  exclusive use and enjoyment of such properties and under the total control of such owner(s). 
 
(c) General policies. 
 
(1) Official City Street System.  Those streets listed in Ordinance No. 4062 shall constitute the initial list of city streets accepted for routine perpetual maintenance.  Additional streets may be added to the city=s street system only after acceptance by ordinance adopted by the board of directors in accordance with the policies enumerated in Section (d) or (e) hereof. 
 
 
Title 12 . Page 16 Supplement No. 23 
12-2-11 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-2-11 
 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
 
 
(2) Street Improvements.  Routine perpetual maintenance includes repaving, patching, ditch cleaning and other related work on existing street base.  Improvements, beyond routine maintenance and resurfacing (e.g., widening, shoulder improvements, drainage improvements, curb and gutter, etc.), to streets which are part of the official street system shall only be accomplished in those instances where adequate right-of-way exist through dedication and specific funding allocations are received and approved by the board of directors (e.g., grants-in-aid, street improvement district funding, property owner funding, etc.).  If adequate dedication does not exist, adjacent property owners must provide such dedication.  Provided, however, that in the case of major public thoroughfares, the city may undertake such improvements as approved by the board of directors. 
 
(3) Annexation.  In the event areas are annexed to the city, the engineering department shall conduct an inventory of all streets and roads within the newly annexed area and report to the board of directors the condition and apparent use of all known streets and roads.  The board of directors shall by ordinance accept for routine perpetual maintenance those streets and roads which are used by the public generally, which are currently paved (regardless of present condition and right-of-way) and which are readily recognized as public streets.  Roadways not qualifying for initial acceptance shall be accepted in accordance with Section (c) or (d) hereof.  Streets so accepted shall be part of the official street system and subject to the policies and procedures enumerated herein. 
 
(4) Records.  The city's planning department shall keep accurate records concerning all streets which have been officially accepted for perpetual maintenance by the board of directors. 
 
(5) Signage.  Whenever street name signage for 911 emergency service or other purposes is installed by city forces on any street, lane or drive which has not been accepted by the city for routine perpetual maintenance, said signage shall bear the notation of "(pvt.)" to designate that such street, lane or drive is of a private nature and not the maintenance responsibility of the city.

(6) Street Naming.  All streets accepted for perpetual maintenance shall be named in accordance with Ordinance 4012 and/or the "Street Naming and Property Numbering Guide" adopted by Resolution of the board of directors pursuant to the 911 emergency services program. 
 
(d) Acceptance procedures. 
 
(1) Platted Streets.  Streets within recorded subdivisions, planned developments, or commercial properties must be constructed in accordance with Ordinance 4836 (' 16-4-1 et seq.), as amended and/or Ordinance 4835 (' 15-10-1 et seq.), as amended prior to acceptance by the city.  Once constructed said streets shall be accepted for routine perpetual maintenance by the city only after passage of an Ordinance for that purpose by the board of directors.  Filing of an instrument of dedication (e.g., development plat) does not constitute acceptance by the city.  Provided, however, in the event a street was officially recorded but never developed following the recording and it is no longer within an active development area (e.g., a subdivision no longer under construction by the original developer), such street may be constructed in accordance with paragraph 2 below. 
 
Amendment note-' 12-2-11 (d)(1) formerly referred to street construction requirements of Ord. Nos. 3236 and 3309.  Ord. Nos. 3236 and 3309 have subsequently been superceded by Ord. Nos. 4836 and 4835, respectively. 
 
(2) Underdeveloped Streets.  Those streets, lanes, etc. which have evolved through public and/or private use or other circumstances, other than recorded dedication, over a period of years and which are not part of a platted subdivision, or a residential or commercial planned development or platted streets in nonactive subdivision as described in paragraph (d) (1), shall be accepted by ordinance only after completion of the following by the adjacent property owner(s): 
 
a. dedication of not less than forty foot of right-of-way. 
 
b. initial construction (in accordance with the current standards of the city's engineering department) of an adequate street base, application of an appropriate hard surface treatment  (e.g., pea seal/hot mix asphalt) and provision of adequate drainage improvements including curb and gutter.  Provided, however, that curb and gutter may not be required where adequate underground drainage structures are not otherwise available in the adjacent area to support the storm water runoff created by the installation of curb and gutter.  The city manager shall determine when curb and gutter is not required upon recommendation of the engineering and planning/zoning departments.  (See paragraph (c) (2) regarding improvements after acceptance by the city.)

c. payment for the initial improvements in one of the following methods: 
 
i. direct payment by the property owner(s) to those accomplishing the work (e.g., a private contractor) or through formation of a street improvement district per Arkansas law.  In this case, the city's engineering department will provide contract supervision and inspection services at no cost if so requested by the property owner(s); or 
 
ii. deposit with the city of an amount equal to the projected costs of all materials necessary to construct the street base, surface treatment and drainage improvements as estimated by the city's engineering department.  In this case, the city will accomplish the work with no charge for labor to the property owner(s) provided the project is within the scope of the city's resources (funding, time and personnel) to accomplish; 
 
iii. in the event upfront deposit of the material costs is not possible and the development costs are within the scope of the city's abilities to fund, the city may perform the street construction and be reimbursed by the property owner(s) through a cooperative agreement (e.g., addition to the monthly municipal utility bill) or by formation of a street improvement district.  Street improvement districts must be formed in accordance with appropriate state statutes.  If a cooperative agreement is utilized, the following policies shall apply: 
 
1) property owners on each side of the street will be assessed a prorated share of the cost of materials on a front foot basis; 
 
2) improvement costs plus simple interest at the rate of ten percent (10%), may be paid over three years; provided however, should all costs be paid within the first year no interest will be charged.  Street improvement projects may not be paid out for more than three years; and 
 
3) nothing herein shall prohibit additional arrangements among the parties involved (e.g., payment of all charges by a single owner in multi-owner situations).

12-2-12.  Alley acceptance policy. 
 
 (a) Purpose statement.  Alleys within the city of Hot Springs  are currently used for a variety of purposes including public roadways, private roadways and utility easements.  In addition, many alleys have been platted but have never been opened or developed for use.  State statute specifies that alleys are not under the care and control of city government until and unless they have been specifically accepted by ordinance of the governing body (A.C.A. 14-301-102). 
 
It is necessary, therefore, that the city have an accurate and consistent inventory of alleys which are accepted and maintained by the city and over which the city excises care and control for the benefit of the general public.  In this regard, the following policies and procedures shall govern the methods and circumstances under which the city shall accept and maintain alleys within the corporate limits of Hot Springs. 
 
 (b) Definitions.  The following words and phrases have the following meanings for purposes of this policy: 
 
(1) City alley.  A narrow roadway designed for the special accommodation of the property it reaches and open for the common use of all citizens not limited or restricted to any particular group or property owner.  "City Alleys" may be either dedicated or prescription right-of-ways which have been accepted for perpetual maintenance by the board of directors.  An alley is not a "city alley", for purposes of this policy, until and unless it has specifically been accepted by ordinance of the governing body. 
 
(2) City utility alley.  A platted but undeveloped roadway  accepted by ordinance of the city for use as an alley for the construction and maintenance of water, sewer, storm drainage or other public utilities under the care and control of the city. 
 
(3) Dedicated alley.  Specific right-of-way set apart by a property owner(s) for use as an alley by means of a recorded plat so designating the right-of-way whether or not said right-of-way has ever been developed and used as a roadway.

(4) Prescription alley.  A narrow roadway which has become an alley due to open, continuous and exclusive use as a public roadway over a period of time as per Arkansas law. 
 
(5) Private alley.  A narrow roadway created by specific action or common consent of one or more property owners for their restricted enjoyment and use  and all "dedicated or prescription alleys" which have not been specifically accepted for perpetual maintenance by ordinance of the city's governing body. 
 
(6) Private driveway.  An entrance to one or more properties created by the owner(s) thereof for the exclusive use and enjoyment of such properties and under the total control of such owner(s). 
 
(c) General policies.   
 
(1) Official city alley system.  Only those alleys which may been accepted by ordinance of the board of directors shall constitute the official city alley system.  In this regard, alleys shall be accepted in one of two classes -- city alley (roadway) or city utility alley. 
 
(2) City alley (roadway) improvement and maintenance.  For those alleys that are accepted as city alleys, the city shall provide routine perpetual maintenance.  Routine perpetual maintenance shall include re-paving, paving, patching, grading and limited related roadway base improvements.  The city shall not engage in initial roadway construction for previously unopened or unused alleys.  Initial roadway construction shall be the responsibility of the adjacent property owners or, in the case of active subdivision developments, the developer.  City alleys shall be maintained on an as needed basis in a lower priority status than other street work and subject to the available of sufficient city resources. 
 
(3) City utility alley improvement and maintenance.  For those alleys that are accepted as city utility alleys, the city shall provide limited routine perpetual maintenance.  Routine perpetual maintenance shall include clearing, mowing and limited grading necessary to provide access to the city owned utility lines or city owned drainage structures.  City utility alleys shall not be improved as city alleys (roadways) unless and until specifically accepted as city alleys by the board of directors.  City utility alleys shall be maintained on an as needed basis in a lower priority status than other street work and subject to the available of sufficient city resources. 
 
(4) Annexation.  In the event areas are annexed to the city, the city's engineering department shall conduct an inventory of all alleys within the newly annexed area and report to the board of directors the condition and apparent use of all known streets.  The board of directors shall then, by ordinance, accept for routine perpetual maintenance those alleys which are readily recognized and used as public alleys or are needed for public utility easements.

(5) Records.  The city's planning department shall keep accurate records concerning all alleys which have been officially accepted by the city by class of alley (city alley or city utility alley). 
 
(6) Alley signage and naming.  Names may be assigned to alleys and signage installed when necessary for 911 response or other governmental purposes.  City installed signs may be placed on unaccepted alleys if such signage bears the notation "pvt" indicating that the alley is private in nature and not the maintenance responsibility of the city. 
 
(d) Acceptance procedures. 
 
(1) Existing alleys.  Alleys which currently exist and are utilized as either public roadways or public utility easements may be presented to the board of directors for consideration for acceptance on a case by case basis.  The determining factor in presenting such alleys is their benefit for public use and/or benefit to the city generally.  The board of directors shall review the circumstances surrounding each alley presented and determine if the alley should be accepted by ordinance as a city alley (roadway) or city utility alley, or the board shall deny the acceptance for city maintenance.  Existing alleys which have limited public use or vehicular access may be accepted after construction of the initial roadbase by the adjacent property owner. 
 
(2) Alleys in new developments.  All alleys in new developments shall be constructed in accordance with the alley construction standards of the city by the developer or development/property owner(s) and, once so constructed, shall be accepted for perpetual maintenance by ordinance of the board of directors. 
 
(3) Platted-non-existent alleys.  Alleys which have been platted but never opened or utilized as alleys shall not be accepted by the city until such alleys are constructed in accordance with the following construction standards by the adjacent property owner(s) or other authorized party: 
 
a. dedication of not less than 20 foot of right-of-way. 
 
b. initial construction (in accordance with the standards of the city's engineering department) of an adequate street base and application of an appropriate hard surface treatment (e.g. pea seal/hot mix asphalt). 
 
c. provision of adequate drainage improvements.  In some cases, open ditches may be acceptable if all connecting drainage is open ditch; however, closed drainage or curb and gutter may be required if all connecting drainage is enclosed.  The city engineer shall determine if drainage improvements are needed and the type needed based on other similar circumstances.

Once constructed, the alley shall be accepted for perpetual maintenance by ordinance of the board of directors.  Platted alleys needed as public utility alleys may be accepted as such by the city upon presentation and recommendation by the appropriate city department, in which case the initial construction of the utility alley shall be accomplished by the city to the extent necessary for the intended utility purpose . 
 
(4) Payment methods.  Payment for the initial improvement, when required of a third party, may be accomplished in one of the following methods: 
 
a. direct payment by the property owner(s) to those accomplishing the work (e.g., a private contractor) or through formation of a street/alley improvement district per Arkansas law.  In this case, the city's engineering department will provide contract supervision and inspection services at no cost if so requested by the property owner(s); or 
 
b. deposit with the city of an amount equal to the projected costs of all materials necessary to construct the alley base, surface treatment and drainage improvements as estimated by the city's engineering department.  In this case, the city will accomplish the work with no charge for labor to the property owner(s) provided the project is within the scope of the city's resources (funding, time and personnel) to accomplish; 
 
c. in the event upfront deposit of the material costs is not possible and the development costs are within the scope of the city's abilities to fund, the city may perform the alley construction and be reimbursed by the property owner(s) through a cooperative agreement (e.g., addition to the monthly municipal utility bill) or by formation of a street/alley improvement district.  Street/alley improvement districts must be formed in accordance with appropriate state statutes.  If a cooperative agreement is utilized, the following policies shall apply: 
 
1) property owners on each side of the alley will be assessed a prorated share of the cost of materials on a front foot basis; 
 
2) improvement costs plus simple interest at the rate of ten percent (10%), may be paid over three years; provided however, should all costs be paid within the first year no interest will be charged.  Alley improvement projects may not be paid out for more than three years; and

12-2-13.3.  General policies. 
 
 The following general policies shall apply to requests for limited use easements: 
 
(a) Limited use easement request.   A limited use easement must be at the request of a property owner.  Requests may not be submitted by a tenant or other agent.  Requests shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the office of the city clerk.  Any such request must be accompanied by a plat describing the private property and the portion of the public right-of-way for which the owner desires the limited use easement. 
 
(b) Departmental review.  The office of the city clerk shall distribute the limited use easement request to all city departments which may be affected by the granting of the request.

Should any city department identify a public purpose, which would preclude the granting of an easement, the requests shall be denied by the city manager. 
 
(c) Board of directors review.  Any request which does not preclude a public purpose shall be forwarded to the board of directors for consideration.  The board of directors may either approve, deny or modify the request. 
 
(d) Request criteria.  No limited use easement request shall be granted unless the following conditions are met: 
 
(1) A minimum width of 40 feet remains unencumbered by the easement along a public street.  (Hence, a street must have a dedicated right-of-way width of more than 40 feet before an easement could be considered.); 
 
(2) There is no known public purpose for the area for which an easement is sought; 
 
(3) In the case of a street right-of-way, the easement line nearest the street shall not be less than six feet from the outside edge (yard side) of the ditch line or curb; 
 
(4) The desired improvement is to be of a nature such that it can be removed upon short notice.  Permanent buildings or other such improvements which require a foundation or other installations which cannot be easily be removed shall not be permitted; and 
 
(5) The owner executes a limited use easement agreement as approved by the board of directors.

 DRAINAGE MAINTENANCE POLICY 
 
 
CHAPTER 3 
 
 
DRAINAGE MAINTENANCE POLICY 
 
 
12-3-1.  Storm water drainage maintenance policy. 
 
12-3-1.1.  Purpose.   
 
 The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to city staff regarding the acceptance and maintenance of drainage systems located on private property.  For purposes of this policy, the term Adrainage system@ means any creek, branch, stream, brook, tributary, channel, open ditch or other such conveyance facilities, such as pipe, culverts and arches, which transports storm water runoff. 
 
12-3-1.2.  Acceptance criteria.   
 
 In order to be considered for perpetual maintenance by the city, a drainage system must have a significant and consistent impact on public streets, roads, alleys or public lands or otherwise be directly related to the public storm water drainage system.  The mere existence of a drainage system does not constitute a public impact qualifying it for acceptance. 
 
12-3-1.3.  Requests for maintenance.   
 
 Any property owner(s) desiring that a drainage system on their property be accepted for city maintenance must submit a request, in writing, to the city engineer.  The request must state that the property owner will comply with this policy including the provision of a maintenance easement if the drainage system is accepted by the board of directors.  Upon receipt, the city engineer shall evaluate the request and if it is determined that the request meets the criteria for acceptance, the city engineer shall prepare a report for presentation to the board of directors.  The city engineer=s report shall confirm the nature of the private drainage system=s impact upon the public storm water drainage system.  Should the city engineer determine that the  request does not have a significant impact on the public storm water drainage system, the city engineer shall so inform the requestor.  The requestor may appeal the city engineer=s denial to the board of directors.  Requests may also be initiated by the city engineer in which case the city engineer will obtain from the property owner(s) a statement indicating that the property owner(s) will grant the required easement if the drainage system is accepted by the board of directors. 
 
12-3-1.4.  Board action required.   
 
 City crews may maintain only those drainage systems located on private property which have been individually and specifically accepted for perpetual maintenance by resolution of the board of directors and for which easements have been obtained.  Any such acceptance by the board of directors shall be contingent upon property owner compliance with this policy (e.g., provision of easement).

12-3-1.5 HOT SPRINGS CODE 12-3-1.7 
 DRAINAGE MAINTENANCE POLICY 
 
 
12-3-1.5.  Easement.   
 
Once a drainage system has been accepted for perpetual maintenance by resolution of the board of directors, the city engineer shall prepare an easement for execution by the property owner.  Such easement must provide permanent Afree use@ access in favor of the city.  Easements shall state the city is not responsible for removal or restoration of fences, grass, sod, shrubs or other such improvements placed on the easement by the property owner.  No buildings or other structures of any kind or nature may be placed on the easement.  Easements must have a minimum width of  twenty (20) feet; however, the width may be increased if field conditions require additional width to effectively maintain the drainage system.  The easement, or a series of easements in combination,  must extend to an existing public right-of-way (e.g., street or alley) such that access to the drainage system can be gained without crossing private property.  Temporary easement may be requested for ease of access to the drainage systems.  The permanent easement must be marked or otherwise tied to known references (e.g., property corners) such that it can be identified on site.  Survey costs, if required to establish the easement, must be paid by the property owner(s) unless the request was initiated by the city engineer in which case the survey costs will be paid by the city.  All permanent easements shall be filed with the city clerk and recorded with the Garland County Circuit Clerk. 
 
12-3-1.6.  Drainage system improvement and maintenance costs.   
 
The construction, improvement and maintenance of accepted drainage systems on private property shall be subject to such financial resources as may be appropriated for such purposes annually by the board of directors.  The city will not be responsible for any costs which may be aesthetic in nature and not directly related to the provision of effective storm water control.  In this regard, the property owner(s) shall be solely responsible for any such aesthetic costs (e.g., rock covered head walls; landscaping; pipe to close ditches, if not required by city engineer; non essential curbing; etc.). 
 
12-3-1.7.  Policy waiver.   
 
The board of directors reserves the right to waive any provisions of this policy in unusual or unique circumstances when strict adherence would not be in the best interest of the public generally.

That the following AFare and General Operating Policies@ for Hot Springs Intracity Transit (IT) are hereby adopted. 
 
13-2-1.1.  General operating policies. 
 
The following policies shall apply to all the services and operating divisions of Hot Springs Intracity Transit as enumerated hereinafter. 
 
(a) Routes and hours and days of operation.  IT  management may temporarily adjust the hours of operation or routes when necessary due to unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances such as inclement weather or similar service interruptions, as well as to accommodate special needs of a short term nature such as conventions or community events. 
 
(b) Exact fare.  In order to ensure security and control of unrecorded cash and to provide for the safety of bus operators and passengers, IT shall require deposit of exact fares in all services requiring passenger deposit of fares.  Bus operators shall not be permitted to make change or otherwise handle cash or fares. 
 
(c) IT management.  It is the desire of the City of Hot Springs to operate IT in a cost-effective manner while providing quality mass public transportation services to the citizens of Hot Springs.  In this regard, IT management may be accomplished by management contract or as a direct operating department of the city or a combination thereof.  If operated under an operations contract, such agreement shall clearly define city and contractor functional responsibilities; and the city shall retain such administrative, operational and maintenance functions as deemed necessary by the city manager to ensure an effective and efficient public transit service for the community.  Management and operations contracts, if any, shall be awarded pursuant to a competitive proposal process. 
 
(d) Customer service.  In addition to any customer service policies established pursuant to paragraph (f) hereof, IT management is hereby authorized to develop a program for the provision of a free ride in situations where service delays or failures have created an undue hardship on a particular system patron.  This service shall be provided by means of an Aoops@ card which entitles the recipient to one free ride on any division of the IT system.  The Aoops@ cards shall be pre-numbered and shall be accounted for by IT management.

(e) Public safety program.  In conjunction with the Hot Springs police department, IT management is hereby authorized to develop a public safety program consisting of two elements--@safe haven@ and Atransit on watch.@  Under the Asafe haven@ program, any citizen who feels endangered or is in need of limited emergency transportation (e.g., vehicle breakdown) may board any IT bus and request a Asafe haven@ ride to the nearest public telephone located on the bus route.  The Asafe haven@ ride shall be provided at no charge; provided, however, that service may be refused to repetitive patrons with no reasonable emergency situation.  The Atransit on watch@ element shall utilize IT bus drivers as eyes for the police department.  Drivers may be trained to observe various activities along their route and report unusual or suspected criminal activity to the Hot Springs police department. 
 
(f) Service policies and standards.  In accordance with the service policies established herein, the city manager and IT management shall establish such other service policies and standards as necessary to ensure a quality public transit system.

1. (g)Promotional fare programs.  The city manager is hereby authorized to negotiate  promotional fare programs with third party agencies (e.g., television and radio stations, publications media, local businesses).  Such programs shall be designed to increase and promote IT ridership or certain elements thereof (e.g., attraction shuttles).  As part of a promotional fare program, the regular fares may be discounted up to fifty percent (50%); and a commission of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the discounted fare price may be paid to the promotional or sponsoring agency.  In lieu of commission based on fares, a flat fee commission may be paid; provided, however, that any such fee in excess of $5,000 in any given calendar year shall be accomplished in accordance with the city=s purchasing policies and procedures. 
 
2. (h)Advertising Cards.  The city manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to establish an advertising card program for the placement of third-party advertisements on the inside of Hot Springs Intracity vehicles equipped with advertising card racks.  The rate of such advertisements shall be set by the city manager based on the prevailing rate for the Hot Springs market area for similar type advertisements (e.g., public rest benches, etc.) as may be adjusted given the level of project public exposure on the IT vehicles as compared to other such mediums.

ARTICLE I. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION,  
FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 
 
 
15-8-1.  Statutory authorization. 
 
 Pursuant to A.C.A. 14-268-101, et seq, the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas has delegated the responsibility to cities, towns and counties to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. This ordinance, which shall be cited as the “City of Hot Springs Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance,” is enacted pursuant to said statutory authority. 
 
15-8-2. Findings of fact. 
 
 (a) The flood hazard areas of the city of Hot Springs are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
 
 (b) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains, which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

15-8-3. Statement of purpose. 
 
 It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public  and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
 
(a) Protect human life and health; 
 
(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
 
(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
 
(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
 
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains; 
 
(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
 
(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
 
15-8-4. Methods of reducing flood losses. 
 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
 
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
 
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
 
(c) Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
 
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other developments which may increase flood damage; and 
 
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazard to other lands.

ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS 
 
15-8-5. Definitions. 
 
 Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article have their common usage meaning to give the most reasonable application to this code. Additional definitions for floodplain management terms can be found at Part §59.1 of 44 CFR. 
 
 44 CFR (Emergency Management and Assistance - National Flood Insurance Program Regulations)  Parts 59-75 contain Federal regulations upon which local floodplain managements are based. 
 
 44 CFR § 65.12  contains the section of the Federal regulations which involves revision of flood insurance rate maps to reflect base flood elevations caused by proposed encroachments. 
 
 “100-year flood” is any flood with a 1% chance of occurring in any given year. The term is misleading, because of its statistical derivation. A “100-year flood” may occur many times in any given 100-year period, or it may not occur at all in 100 years. 
 
 “500-year flood” is any flood with a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. As with the 100-year flood, this term is also misleading, because of its statistical derivation. A “500-year flood” may occur many times in any given 500-year period, or it may not occur at all in 500 years. 
 
 “Accessory Structures” are structures which are on the same parcel of property as the principle structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure (such as garages and storage sheds). 
 
 “Adverse impact” means any negative or harmful effect. 
 
 “AE or A1-30 Risk Zones” are special flood hazard areas where detailed studies have determined base flood elevations. AE has replaced Al-30 in newer flood maps. 
 
 “AH Risk Zones” are special flood hazard areas characterized by shallow flooding with ponding effects (where floodwaters accumulate in depressions and linger until absorbed or evaporated). 
 
 “AO Risk Zones” are special flood hazard areas characterized by shallow flooding with sheet flow (where floodwaters flow in a broad, shallow sheet rather than through a narrow channel). 
 
 “A Risk Zones” are special flood hazard areas without detailed studies, where base flood elevations have not been determined.

The Code of Federal Regulations is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. The Federal regulations pertaining to the National Flood Insurance Program are found in Title 44, Emergency Management and Assistance. 
 
 “Clearing” is the act of cutting timber or shrubs from an area. 
 
 “Commercial business park” is typically an area of offices or light industrial usage, although retail, service, or industrial usage is sometimes included in supporting roles. For example, a commercial business park of office complexes may also include restaurants which service these offices. 
 
 “Concrete deadman anchors” are heavy steel rods embedded in buried sections of concrete, used to secure items in place under tension. 
 
 “Covenant” is a clause in a contract that requires one party to do, or refrain from doing, certain things. A covenant frequently appears as a restriction that a lender imposes on a borrower. 
 
 “Crawlspace” is a type of structural foundation where the space beneath the lowest floor is typically not deep enough to allow a person to stand and not all four walls are below grade.

In determining whether substantial damage has occurred, estimators must use standard contractor and materials costs. There are no exceptions for homeowners who make their own repairs or for discounted or free raw materials.

 "Substantial improvement" is any reconstruction, remodeling, addition or improvement to a structure with a cost equaling or exceeding 50% of the market value of the structure before any improvement. Improvements to correct identified violations of local health, sanitary or safety Codes are not substantial improvements, regardless of the cost, as long as they are the minimum improvement necessary to bring the structure up to Code. Alterations to historical structures are also exempted, as long as the improvement does not affect the structure's official status of "historical structure." 
 
 "Uses vulnerable to floods" are simply any land or structural uses that may be negatively affected by a flood. 
 
 "Variance" is a formal, written permission from the Appeals Board to construct or develop in a way that is inconsistent with the requirements of this Code. The variance only deals with this Code - the Appeals Board has no authority to waive any other governmental requirement, and has no say in the cost of flood insurance. 
 
 "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this Code is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
 
 "Watercourse alteration" refers to any change that occurs within the banks of a watercourse. 
 
 "Water Surface Elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
 
 "X Risk Zones" are a special group of insurance risk zones. One type, shown as non-shaded areas on FEMA issued flood maps, indicates a zone where flooding is not expected to occur. The second type, shown as shaded areas of FEMA flood maps, indicates a flood hazard area that is expected to be affected by the 500-year flood, but not by the 100-year base flood.

  (2) When a two (2) year performance assurance is required, it shall be     provided in favor of the City for one hundred percent (100%) of the cost    of the project street repairs. The cost of the repairs and the amount of the    assurance shall be submitted by the permittee to the City with quantities    and unit costs. The City reserves the right to adjust the required amount    of the assurance to the amount they determine to be adequate for the    repairs. If the permittee conducts repeated street cuts and repairs within a    calendar year, the permittee may choose to post a running bond for the    two (2) year period. However, the bond amount shall be adequate to    cover the cost of all the street cuts anticipated within the two (2) year    warranty period. 
 
  (3) Performance assurance shall not be required for work performed by City    staff. However, contractors performing work for the city shall include the    required two-year performance assurance in their contracts. 
  
 (4) Plumbers, electricians, or other contractors who do not regularly work in   the right of way may choose to subcontract pavement repair to a company   who maintains a street repair bond with the City. However, a    performance assurance bond is not required for service repairs or new   service installations if they are installed according to the standards of this   ordinance and are inspected by the City. 
 
 (5) When required, the performance assurance shall be provided in one of the   following forms: 
 
   (i) A bond issued by a bonding company licensed to do business in     the state of Arkansas. The bond shall be in the form approved by     the city attorney. A certificate of the power of attorney for the     individual executing such bonds shall also be submitted.

  (2) The policy shall provide that the insurance shall not be canceled or     materially altered without thirty (30) days prior written notice first being    given to the City. If the insurance is canceled or materially altered, the    right of way user or service provider shall obtain a replacement certificate    of insurance. The right of way user or service provider shall maintain    continuous uninterrupted coverage, in the terms and amounts required.    The right of way user or service provider may self-insure, or keep in    force a self-insured retention plus insurance, for any or all of the above    coverage. 
 
  (3) The right of way user or service provider shall maintain on file with the    City a certificate of insurance, or proof of self-insurance acceptable to the    City, certifying the coverage required above. 
 
15-10-29.8 Compliance.  
 
 Every right of way user or service provider shall comply with all federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of any administrative agency thereof, as well as all applicable ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the City, heretofore or hereafter adopted or established during the term of any franchise. 
 
15-10-29.9 Confidential/Proprietary Information.

15-10-29.10 Penalties.   
  
(a) Any person or entity found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this  ordinance shall be subject to 1-1-15 of the Hot Springs Code of Ordinances.  A  separate and distinct offense shall be deemed committed each day on which a  violation occurs or continues. 




 
(b) In addition to the provisions contained within subsection A of this section, the  City Engineer may impose a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per day  for first time offenders and $500 per day for repeat offenders for any person or  entity who fails to obtain a permit as required in this ordinance, or who otherwise  fails to follow the requirements of this ordinance. The number of days for the  fine shall be the number of days that work has been performed without a permit. 
 
15-10-30.  Repairs. 
 
15-10-30.1  Standard Specifications and Details. 
 
 (a) General. Standard specifications and standard details are adopted by the City of Hot Springs to establish a standard of quality for the installation of utilities in city rights of way. These standards describe acceptable construction practices related to damages within the rights of way, including but not limited to, street pavements, curbs, and sidewalks. 
 
 (b) Trench Compaction and Depth. 
   
  (1) When the trench has been properly backfilled, the permittee shall conduct    a compaction test of the trench backfill.  Compaction tests shall be     performed at the top of the compacted backfill for street cuts. Trench    backfill shall meet ninety-five percent (95%) maximum dry density per    AASHTO T-180. For pavement replacement repairs longer than two    hundred (200) linear feet or if several repairs total more than two hundred    (200) linear feet in any one block, at least one test shall be completed per    every two hundred (200) linear feet or fraction thereof. For spot repairs,    compaction tests shall be required for repairs where a T Cap is not     required. If test results do not meet the standards, or if compaction effort    does not follow standard construction practice, the City Engineer may    require more frequent tests. If test results consistently meet the standards,    and the same compaction effort and method is consistently being used,    and if a T Cap repair is being used, then the city engineer may reduce the    frequency of testing to one per every six hundred (600) linear feet. 
   
  (2) When a passing compaction test has been obtained, the permittee shall    contact the City for an inspection. The permittee shall contact the City    twenty-four (24) hours before the expected need for an inspection and    then re-schedule as necessary. A copy of passing compaction tests shall    be provided to the City. No concrete or asphalt shall be placed until    completion of the passing compaction test and inspection. 
 
  (3) Pipes, cables, and conduits shall be placed a minimum of 18” below the    bottom of drainage ditches, pipes, culverts and drainage structures.

STREET SPECIFICATIONS 
 
 (c) Standard of Acceptance. Failure of a street repair shall be defined as any one of the following conditions: 
 
  (1) Failure of the backfill to meet ninety-five percent (95%) Modified     Proctor Density according to AASHTO T-180. 
 
  (2) Depth of asphalt more than one quarter inch (1/4”) less than the specified    depth of two inches (2”) minimum (or match existing). However,     consistent “shaving” of the pavement minimum will be cause for     rejection. 
  
  (3) Depth of T Cap concrete less than one half inch (1/2”) less than the    required minimum depth of eight inches (8”). However, consistent     “shaving” of the eight inch (8”) minimum will be cause for rejection. 
 
  (4) The completed wearing surface shall not vary more than one quarter inch    (1/4”) from the lower edge of a ten (10) foot straight edge placed across    the repair. 
 
 (d) Restoration of Unpaved Rights of Way. Restoration of cuts within the rights of way and not under any paved section, or section to be paved, shall be backfilled in accordance with the city utility trench backfill section included in this specification, unless the permitted utility operator’s requirements are more stringent. The backfill shall be maintained by the permittee until final settlement has occurred.  After final settlement has occurred, the area above excavations outside of paved sections shall be repaired with the same type and quality of materials as existed prior to the beginning of excavation. Lawns or other sod or turf areas disturbed by the work shall be replaced with sod or turf of the same plant variety and quality as that removed. Damage to drainage structures or culverts shall be reported to the City and repairs shall be made by the Contractor at the Contractor’s expense.   
 
 (e) Restoration of Sidewalks and Curbs. Damage to sidewalks and curbs shall be repaired and repairs shall comply with ADA regulations. Sidewalk repairs shall be saw cut, rectangular, full width repairs. For sidewalks more than six feet wide, the minimum length of sidewalk replacement shall be four feet. The minimum remaining section of existing concrete shall be two feet to the next joint. If less than two feet, remove and replace to the joint. If work damages a ramp then ADA ramps shall be installed at street intersections. Driveway repairs shall be constructed to provide an ADA accessible pedestrian path. 
 
 (f) Restoration of Paved Areas- General Instructions. 
 
  (1) Materials. Repairs for paved areas shall be accomplished in accordance    with the City details that are included in this specification by backfilling    the entire depth and width of the excavation with crushed stone which    meets or exceeds the requirements for class seven (7) Aggregate Base    Course of the latest edition of the Arkansas Department of      Transportation, “Standard Specifications for the Highway Construction.”    Other materials may be proposed for consideration, but are not accepted    without approval of the City Engineer. Submittals of other materials by    the permittee shall include soils testing data adequate for testing proper    compaction, a sieve analysis, and a written recommendation from a    geotechnical engineer.

STREET SPECIFICATIONS 
  
  (2) Timing. The aggregate backfill shall be maintained by the permittee until    the repair concrete cap and pavement is placed.  The replacement     pavement shall be installed in the earliest reasonable time. A phased    restoration plan shall be submitted for city approval for projects with    more than one quarter (¼) mile of street cuts. The work may not advance    unless proper traffic control measures are in place; and cuts are covered    with plates or temporarily filled with cold mix. Plates shall be anchored    in place with cold mix. If multiple plates are required, they shall be tack    welded together, unless waived by the City Engineer. 
 
  (3) Concrete Cap. The backfill under asphalt surface streets shall be capped    with eight (8) inches of concrete by the permittee allowing minimum of    two (2) inches for the final asphalt surface (or match existing asphalt    depth). Concrete shall have a light broom finish and shall cure a     minimum of twenty four (24) hours before the asphalt surface is installed.    Longer cure times may be required by the city if the twenty-four (24)    hour cure is not adequate for the structural integrity of the repair. 
 
  (4) Alternate Detail. If the width of the trench wall is five feet or more,    requiring the concrete T cap to be seven feet wide or more, then, with the    prior approval of the City Engineer, an alternate detail of compacted    Class 7 base may be used rather than the concrete T Cap. A compaction    test at each street crossing or compaction tests every 100 feet are required    for the alternate repair detail. 
 
  (5) Concrete Streets. Resurfacing of concrete streets shall be accomplished    by the permittee with materials and methods meeting the specifications of    the city street code for concrete streets. The final surface shall be of the    same materials and depth as the existing concrete pavement. 
 
  (6) Separations. Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, the     following minimum separations shall be maintained for new installations.    A minimum of 5 feet horizontal and 2 feet vertical shall be maintained    between water or sewer mains and electrical services. A minimum of 2    feet horizontal and 18 inches vertical shall be maintained between water    or sewer mains and gas mains or cable or telephone services. A utility    that must cross another utility should do so as close to perpendicular as    possible but not less than 45 degrees. A minimum of 10 feet horizontal    shall be maintained between water or sewer mains and buildings,     retaining walls, masonry fences, gates, masonry mailboxes, air     conditioning units, generators or other such obstructions. A minimum of    10 feet horizontal, and 1.5 feet vertical shall be maintained between water    mains and sewer mains with the water mains passing above. If conditions    limit these separation requirements, then that utility shall be encased in    concrete or an approved carrier pipe for a distance of 5 feet each side of    the water or sewer main. 
 
 (g) Width of Pavement Repairs 
 
  (1) The minimum width of a repair is shown in the standard details. Trenches    shall be located away from curbs, other utility trenches, foundations,    walls, sidewalks, etc., with enough separation to allow space for the

   installation of the concrete T Cap, including a solid undisturbed soil wall    between two parallel trenches.  Pavement replacement wider than those    shown in the standard details shall be required under the conditions    described in the following sections. 
 
  (2) TRANSVERSE CUTS FOR SERVICES AND PIPES 2” IN DIAMETER    OR LESS IN RECENTLY PAVED STREETS.  If a street has been    paved within the previous five (5) years of the proposed cut, then     transverse cuts across a street for service lines and 2” diameter or smaller    pipes shall not be permitted. Boring shall be used to install service lines    and these smaller lines. Service lines are defined as any cable, wire, pipe,    tubing, or conduit less than two inches (2”) in diameter. If attempts have    been made to install services and they have failed, then the open cut    described for mains may be used if approved by the City Engineer. If the    boring operation causes an uplift in the pavement, then the area shall be    cut out and repaired in accordance with the standard trench cut repair    detail. If the main line is under the street, and a boring pit is required in    the street, then an open cut may be utilized if approved in advance by the    City Engineer. 
 
  (3) CUTS FOR LARGER PIPES IN RECENTLY PAVED STREETS.  If a    street has been paved within the previous five (5) years of the proposed    cut, no longitudinal cuts will be permitted and the proposed project shall    be postponed and rescheduled. If an emergency exists or the City     Engineer determines, in his or her sole discretion, that a cut is necessary,    then the City Engineer may approve boring or an open cut exception.    However, if longitudinal cuts are approved, the entire full lane width of    the street shall be completely milled and repaved for the entire length of    the cut plus 10 feet on each end. 
 
  (4) TRANSVERSE CUTS FOR ALL OTHER STREETS.  If the pavement    has been in place more than five (5) years, then open cuts may be used    for transverse cuts for services, mains, cables, or conduits. The pavement    replacement shall be straight and of uniform width. If spalling or     breaking of the cut edges occur, the replacement pavement width shall    continue to be increased until a uniform straight edge can be provided. If    two transverse cuts are located closer than ten (10) feet apart, then the    pavement replacement shall be combined and made continuous for the    entire space between the two. 
 
  (5) LONGITUDINAL CUTS.  Longitudinal cuts in city streets are     discouraged and the utility is encouraged to locate their installation    outside the paved area. Prior approval of the city is required for     longitudinal cuts. If longitudinal cuts in the paved area are necessary, and    if the pavement has been in place for more than five (5) years, then    longitudinal cuts shall be compacted and have a concrete cap installed    according to the standard details. However, the milling and asphalt     replacement shall have a minimum width of one half of the travel lane or    parking lane. If the longitudinal trench meanders along the street and    crosses the half lane strip, then the repair shall be a full lane width for a    minimum distance of twenty-five (25) feet either side of the crossover    point. If the trench is located closer than four (4) feet from the edge of the

ARTICLE I.  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
15-13-1.  Stormwater management ordinance - Adoption.   
 
 The following regulations, designed to lessen or deter hazards to persons, property and the environment caused by increased runoff, obstructions to drainage and introduction of excessive silts, debris and pollutants into the drainage system, lakes, ponds, streams, rivers and other water bodies in the City of Hot Springs, and to otherwise promote the public health, safety and welfare of the public are hereby adopted and this ordinance may be referred to as the “Hot Springs Stormwater Management Ordinance.” 
 
15-13-1.1.  Introduction and findings. 
 
 The Board of Directors finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare because: 
 
(a) Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff, which reduces percolation of water through soil and increases erosion and flooding; 
 
(b) Improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding, which can endanger property and human life; 
 
(c) Increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems, which decreases the system’s capacity; and 
 
(d) Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices.

15-13-1.2.  Purpose and definitions. 
 
 (a) The purpose of this ordinance is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management associated with both future land development and existing developed land within the city. These requirements will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the City of Hot Springs by establishing performance standards that: 
 
(1) Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding;  
 
(2) Protect public and private property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion;  
 
(3) Ensure the annual runoff rates and volumes from post development site conditions mimic the annual runoff rates and volumes from pre-development site conditions;  
 
(4) Ensure the site design minimizes the generation of stormwater and maximizes pervious areas for stormwater treatment; 
 
(5) Promote regional stormwater management by watershed; 
 
(6) Provide a single, consistent set of performance standards that apply to all developments; 
 
(7) Protect water quality from nutrients, pathogens, toxic matters, debris and other contaminants; 
 
(8) Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge;  
 
(9) Provide a vegetated corridor (buffer) to protect water resources from development;  
 
(10) Protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands; 
 
(11) Provide plant and animal habitat and support riparian ecosystems; 
 
(12) Achieve an 80% reduction in sediment load rates to the City of Hot Springs waters compared to no controls for all new development, a 40% reduction in sediment load rates compared to no controls for all redevelopment and street reconstruction, and a 20% reduction in sediment load rates compared to no controls for existing developments; 
 
(13) Minimize sedimentation to the water resources of the City of Hot Springs;  
 
(14) Protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands;

(15) Protect public and private property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion;  
  
(16) Control soil erosion and sedimentation to minimize soil deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies and storm drainage systems; 
 
(17) Require implementation of Best Management Practices to minimize the discharge of chemicals and other illicit discharges and pollutants, either directly or indirectly into the streams, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water; and into the city’s drainage infrastructure; and 
 
(18) Assuring the City of Hot Springs is and will remain in compliance with federal and state law. 
 
 (b) The application of this ordinance and the provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute.  In addition, if site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or residents, it is the designer’s responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary. 
 
 (c) Enforcement and administration of this ordinance shall be the responsibility of such office(s) or officer(s) as designated by the City Manager, hereinafter termed Administrative Authority.  The Administrative Authority may appoint such inspectors and assistants as necessary to assist in the performance of these duties.  The Administrative Authority shall also be responsible to address other stormwater issues as they relate to the city’s compliance with its Small MS4 Storm Water Permit as issued by ADEQ to the City of Hot Springs.   
 
 (d) Definitions.  As used in the Stormwater Management Ordinance, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: 
 
Best Management Practices (BMPs) - Erosion and sediment control and water quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water, including avoidance of impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed, prohibitions, engineered systems, programs and other management practices published by state or designated area-wide planning agencies.   
 
Bio-retention – (1) An engineered process to manage stormwater runoff, using the chemical, biological and physical properties afforded by a natural, terrestrial-based community of plants, microbes and soil.  Bioretention provides two important functions:  water quantity (flood) controls; and improves water quality through removal of pollutants and nutrients associated with runoff.  (2)  A method used for flow detention by utilizing infiltration. This method is normally used in small areas.

or other factors beyond the control of the permittee prevent immediate remedial action, commence the recommended remedial action and shall complete the remedial work within 72 hours or within a reasonable time as determined in advance by the Administrative Authority.  Upon satisfactory completion of remedial work, the Administrative Authority shall issue a notice of compliance and the development may proceed. 
 
 (k) Enforcement fee.  Where code enforcement action is needed to bring a site into compliance with the Clean Water Act, fees will be charged to the permit holder and or the property owner.  The enforcement fee shall be established by resolution of the Board of Directors. 
 
15-13-1.17.  Penalty. 
 
 The penalty for violation of this ordinance shall, upon conviction in the Hot Springs District Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, be such fines and penalties as established by the general penalty clause for the Hot Springs Code of Ordinances as may now or hereafter be enacted by the Hot Springs Board of Directors. 
 
15-13-1.18.  Conflict resolution and interpretation. 
 
 (a) Interpretation.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
 
 (b) Conflict with other laws.  Whenever the provision of this ordinance impose more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other ordinance, the regulations herein contained shall prevail.  Whenever the provisions of any other ordinance require more restrictive standards than are required herein, the requirements of such shall prevail. 
 
15-13-1.19. Disclaimer of liability. 
 
 (a) The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein and in the Stormwater Management Manual establish minimum requirements which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship.  Use of the requirements contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city or its officers and employees of the adequacy or safety of any stormwater management structure or use of the land.  Nor shall the approval of the stormwater management plan imply that the land uses that are permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff.  The degree of protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study.  Larger storms may occur or stormwater runoff heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  These regulations, therefore, shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.   
 
 (b) Neither approval of a plan under the provisions of this ordinance nor the compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law.

 More specifically, these regulations divide that portion of the planning area boundary existing within the corporate limits into zones. Within these zones or districts, it regulates the location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings; open space; lot coverage; density and distribution of population; and the uses of land, buildings, and structures. It does so in order to achieve the following objectives: 
 
 (a) Efficiency and economy in the process of development; 
 
 (b) The appropriate and best use of land; 
 
 (c) Convenience of traffic and circulation of people and goods;

f. Such Other relevant information as may be requested by the Planning Director as the Director reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether the findings required by Sec. 16-2-11(d)(6), Required Findings for Reasonable Accommodation(s), can be made so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individual(s) affected. 


 
(4) Approval Authority and Approval Procedure: 


 
a. The Planning Director shall have the authority to consider and take action on requests for Reasonable Accommodation(s).

i. Grant or deny the accommodation request; or 

ii. Grant the accommodation request subject to specified nondiscriminatory condition(s); or

c. All written determinations of actions of the Planning Director Shall give notice of the right to appeal and the right to request Reasonable Accommodation(s) on the appeals process(e.g., requesting that City staff attempt to schedule an appeal hearing as soon as legally and practically possible), if necessary.  The notice of action shall be sent to the applicant by mail. 


 
d.

b. Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation; 


 
c. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants; 


 
d. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting. 


 
e. The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City’s Zoning Code (HSC Title 16); 


 
Supplement No. 37  Title 16 . Page 7.3 
16-2-10 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-10 
 ZONING CODE 
 
f.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood; 
 
g. Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking; 


 
h. Whether granting the requesting accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the City’s Land Use or Comprehensive Plan or an applicable specific plan. 


 
i. In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation.  


 
(6) Required Findings for Reasonable Accommodation(s).  In making a determination regarding the reasonableness of a requested Reasonable Accommodation(s), the Approving Authority shall make the following findings: 


 
a. The housing which is the subject of the request for Reasonable Accommodation(s) will be used for an individual protected under the Fair Housing Act. 


 
b. The request for Reasonable Accommodation(s) is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual protected under the Fair Housing Act. 


 
c. The requested Reasonable Accommodation(s) does not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City and does not fundamentally alter City zoning, development standards, policies or procedures. 


 
d. The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the natures of the City’s zoning process, as “fundamental alteration’ is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.

16-2-29. Creation of new zones. 
 
No new zones may be created within the land area of an existing zoning classification unless such rezoning is appropriate to the area and is in the general public interest, and not merely in the interest of an individual or small group. Such rezoning must also convincingly demonstrate that the character of the neighborhood will not be materially or adversely affected by the uses permitted in the proposed change.  
 
16-2-30. Size of new zones. 
 
In order to circumvent spot zoning in the city, new zones shall consist of a minimum of two acres, with the exception of the PD  and CTR zoning districts. These districts are permitted to be less than two acres to provide innovation and flexibility. (Ord. No. 5905, §2, 11-20-2012)

(b)  Territory annexed by the election method will be temporarily zoned Rural Residential (R-1) for a period of 60 days following certification of the election. During this time the planning commission may conduct a public hearing to discuss the zoning of newly annexed areas and any modifications to the comprehensive plan that might be appropriate. Notice of the public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation no less than 15 days prior to the hearing. Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall forward a report to the board of directors proposing changes, as necessary, to the comprehensive plan and recommended zoning classification(s) to the newly annexed property. The board of directors shall then act upon the recommendations in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-2-11.

 (d) Islands annexed by ordinance shall be assigned a temporary zoning classification of Rural Residential (R-1) at the time the board of directors annexes the territory by ordinance. The board of directors may request, at that time, that the planning commission hold a public hearing and recommend a permanent zoning classification to the board of directors. Notice of the public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation no less than 15 days prior to the hearing. If the board of directors does not request that the planning commission prepare a recommendation when the annexation ordinance is passed, the territory annexed by ordinance shall be classified as Rural Residential (R-1). 
 
 (e) An accurate plat of any newly annexed area shall be submitted by the owner(s)/developer(s) to the planning commission for the purpose of zoning. No building permits shall be issued prior to the completion of annexation.

In the case of conflict between these regulations and others in force in the planning 
area, the most restrictive standard shall apply.  
 
16-2-34. Validity.

b. The police chief is satisfied that the proposed front setbacks will not hinder law enforcement activities in any way; 
 
c. The public works director is satisfied that no additional street right-of-way or utility easements will be needed and that the proposed front yard setback will not adversely affect traffic or utility service; 
 
d. The proposed front yard setback is not incompatible with adjacent properties and will not adversely affect the civic design and arrangement of existing development; 
 
e. The proposed front yard setback poses no threat to the public health, safety and welfare;  
 
f. The unit meets the minimum off-street parking requirements and also has two temporary off-street parking spaces for the storage of vehicles; and 
 
g. The petition has been duly presented and filed with city staff ten (10) days prior to the planning commission hearing.

The corresponding land use in the comprehensive plan is Residential Low. R-2 developments shall provide internal traffic systems that reflect an interconnected grid system to the extent allowed by existing topography. Because of its lower densities, R-2 will be appropriate on steeper topography. Access to developments should be by collector or arterial level streets. Developments should exist away from both industrial development and intensely developed commercial areas.

16-2-47. PD Planned Development District. 
 
 (a) General description. The purposes of this zone are to promote flexibility and innovation in design and to encourage innovation in the design of large-scale developments and the development of vacant, in-fill parcels in the built up portion of the city. The zone also promotes the inclusion of open space into project design. The Planned Development (PD) is a superimposed description that provides wider latitude of design to achieve the goals stated above. 
  
In concept, the PD is a combination of zoning designation and site plan. A detailed site plan is required for permitting. Development must follow the site plan exactly.  Failure in this respect will result in reversion of the property to the original zoning. Although design innovation is encouraged, and flexibility is allowed, the PD may not be used simply as a method of avoiding zoning regulations. Once approved, the site plan becomes a zoning district by city ordinance in the same manner as any other zoning parcel. 
 
 
Supplement No. 32  Title 16 . Page 41 
16-2-47 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-47 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
The planning commission shall consider a PD proposal only if it meets one of the following threshold criteria: 
 
 (1) The PD will allow the development of an infill parcel in the developed portion of the city that could not be made productive under normal zoning regulations. 
 
 (2) The PD would further the city’s goal of providing housing for all economic segments of the city and its Planning Area Boundary. 
 
 (3) The PD involves a parcel in which flexibility would allow high quality or innovative urban design. 
 
 (4) The PD would aid in the elimination of slums and blight within the city and its Planning Area Boundary. 
 
 (5) The PD design results in a minimum of 30 percent of the total development being reserved as permanent open space 
 
 (b) Application process. The applicant for a Planned Development permit shall be the owner(s) of the property or the party designated to act as agent for the owners(s). The responsibilities of the applicant are as follows: 
 
 (1) Pre-application conference. Each prospective applicant shall confer with city staff in connection with the preparation of the application prior to the submission. At this conference, the following information and data shall be considered. 
 
  a. The boundaries of the property 
 
  b. Existing easements and covenants affecting the property 
 
  c. Physical characteristics such as drainage, topography, vegetation and existing structures. 
 
  d. Development characteristics such as surrounding land uses, existing streets and availability of utilities. 
 
  e. Elements of the proposed layout such as land uses, open spaces, community facilities, densities, traffic flow and estimated impact on traffic and adjacent land uses. 
 
 (2) Pre-submission to the planning commission. The applicant may elect to present a sketch plat of the proposed PD to the Hot Springs Planning Commission. Pre-submission of the sketch plat to the planning commission is strictly to receive comments and/or suggestions from the commission. Approval of the sketch plat by the commission shall not be binding.

 (d) Regulations.  
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 31  Title 16 . Page 43 
16-2-47 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-47 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 (1) Lot size:  No minimum district sizes are established, per se, however, Planned Developments of less than two acres will only be considered for residential purposes. Planned Developments greater than two acres in size may contain mixed uses. Housing can be clustered or otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned locations on the site to take advantage of its natural features. The proposed lots and the type of development (i.e., housing, mixed use) for each shall be clearly depicted. 
 
(2) Open space reservation:  Land not used by buildings, accessory structures, and yards, but required by the zoning district in which the site is located shall be maintained as open space for the purpose of providing parks, recreational facilities, ways for pedestrian movement and circulation, and conserving visually pleasing elements of the environment.  Prior to the sale of any lot, site, home or other structure, a performance guarantee of sufficient surety determined by the city engineer shall be posted with the city for completion of said open space improvements.  The site plan shall clearly depict the amount of land to be maintained as permanent open space. 
 
(3) Development density:  The site plan shall clearly depict the proposed density by land use category. 
 
 (4) Property owners’ association:  The developer shall submit a set of covenants running with the land, providing for an automatic membership in the property owners’ association, to be an incorporated nonprofit organization, operating under recorded land agreements designed and intended to exist in perpetuity, through which each property owner in the Planned Development is automatically subject to a charge for an appropriate proportionate share of the expenses for maintaining the common property, open space and/or other activities of the association.  Once established, the covenants shall continue and remain in force during the entire existence of the Planned Development. 
 
 (5) Responsibility for open space:  Nothing in this section of the Code shall be construed as assigning or assuming any responsibility or liability on the part of the city of Hot Springs, for maintenance of any private open areas, parks, or recreational facilities.  A hold harmless clause shall be incorporated in the covenants running with the land to this effect.  It shall be provided further, however, that when an owner of a Planned Development desires to dedicate certain land areas to the city for public parks and recreational facilities, and the city approves the nature and location of such lands, and accepts the dedicated areas, the city shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of these lands and properties. 
 
(6) Common open spaces: The size, shape, dimension and location of the common open spaces shall be determined by the planning commission in conjunction with the developer or subdivider, with consideration being given to the size and extent of the proposed development and the physical characteristics of the land being developed.  Consideration should also be given in providing parks, recreational facilities, both active and passive, and pedestrian walkways. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Title 16 . Page 44  Supplement No. 31 
16-2-47 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-47 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
Common open space shall be guaranteed by a restrictive covenant, describing the open space and its maintenance and improvement, running with the land for the benefit of the residents of the Planned Development.  The developer shall file, at the time the approved final plat is filed, legal documents that will produce the aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, will provide for restricting the use of common open spaces for the designated purpose. 
 
 (7) Preservation plan:  In order to minimize the disturbance of the natural environment, a general preservation plan shall be required at the time of preliminary plat submission; this shall show the specific type, size and nature of the preservation area.  The planning commission shall review the preservation plan in conjunction with the review of the preliminary plat. 
 
The preservation of the natural amenities within the Planned Development, including topography, trees, ground cover, natural bodies of water, and other significant natural features, shall be given due consideration. Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible.  The location of trees shall be considered when planning the common open space, location of buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas, and finished grade levels. Excessive site clearing of topsoil, trees and natural features before the commencement of building operations shall be discouraged by the planning commission. The applicant shall provide evidence as how these objectives are to be met. 
 
 (8) Transportation:  The vehicular circulation system shall be designed so as to permit smooth traffic flow with minimum hazards to pedestrian traffic.  Minor streets within Planned Development shall not be connected to streets outside the development in such a way as to encourage their use by through traffic. 
 
The pedestrian circulation system and its related walkways shall be insulated as reasonably as possible from the vehicular movement.  This shall include, when deemed to be necessary by the planning commission, pedestrian underpass or overpass in the vicinity of schools, playgrounds, local shopping areas, and other neighborhood uses that generate a considerable amount of pedestrian traffic. 
 
 (9) Land subdivision:  In the construction and installation of all subdivision improvements in the Planned Development, said improvements shall conform to all requirements and standards as set forth in the city’s subdivision regulations, unless exception to the requirements is recommended and approved by the planning commission. 
 
If the owners in the future should request that the private streets be changed to public streets, the owners do fully agree that, before the acceptance of such streets by the city, the owners will bear full expense of reconstruction or any other action necessary to make the streets fully conform to the requirements applicable to public streets, prior to dedication and acceptance.  The owners also shall agree that these streets shall be dedicated to public use without compensation to the owners. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 31  Title 16 . Page 45 
16-2-47 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-47 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
 (e) Review process. The planning commission shall review the proposed PD after proper submittal of all documents and review by the appropriate city staff. In reviewing any proposal, the planning commission shall determine that the PD will:  
 
 (1) Provide public benefits that would not be achievable through the normal zoning regulations 
 
 (2) Not create undue or unmitigated negative traffic impacts. 
 
 (3) Be compatible with surrounding developments. 
 
 (4) Be compatible with the city’s future land use plan. 
 
 (5) Not endanger the public health, welfare or safety, nor shall it substantially diminish or impair property values in the neighborhood in which it is located. 
 
 (6) Be of a character and contain such uses that are needed in the area of the proposed project. 
 
 (f)  Board of directors approval.  Planned Developments represent zoning districts and must be approved by the board of directors.  Upon approval by the planning commission, all recommendations shall be submitted to the Hot Springs Board of Directors for approval.  The board of directors will not consider any revisions to the site plan or development proposal that have not been reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission must approve any contemplated deviation from the approved site plan. Any dedications of streets or easements to the city must be included in the ordinance approving the PD. 
 
 (g) Amendments. Following board approval the staff may approve minor revisions to the site plan if: 
 
 (1) No changes are made to either the access or the egress to the PD. 
 
 (2) Any changes to internal traffic arteries do not alter overall traffic patterns, size of streets, or functional classification of streets. 
 
 (3) No new streets are proposed for dedication. 
 
 (4) No new private streets are proposed. 
 
 (5) Overall residential density is not increased. 
 
 (6) Overall drainage patterns are not altered. 
 
 (7) No additional loads are placed on municipal utilities. 
 
 (8) Retail and office space is not increased by more than five percent. 
 
 
 
 
 
Title 16 . Page 46  Supplement No. 31 
16-2-47 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-48 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
 (9) No open space is dedicated for public maintenance. 
 
If there is disagreement about the administration of the above, or if the staff is unsure of its authority, proposed revisions shall be submitted to the planning commission. 
 
16-2-48. Village District. 
 
 (a)  Description and concept. The Village District allows the planning and development of self-sustaining, mixed use communities with distinct identities. Normally, a separate zoning district will exist in each village development; however, multiple villages could exist within a single district if their scale and design were appropriate. The Village District differs from a Planned Development  insofar as the site plan requirements are concerned. Master plan approval is required for a Village District Zoning. The purpose of the master plan, however, serves to determine housing densities, land use allocations, the overall traffic system, and open space instead of a precise design of the development. This allows the developer more flexibility in phasing and adapting to market conditions. It also reduces the need for extensive plan amendments requirements for adjustments to the plan. By their nature, village districts will be large scale developments with enough land to permit buffers with adjoining neighborhoods. The key issues in locating Village Districts are access, connections to traffic arteries, and compatibility with the future land use plan. 
 
 (b)  Minimum size of development.  The minimum size of any development within a Village Zoning District shall be 40 (forty) acres. 
 
 (c) Master plan required.  Each development within a Village Zoning District shall require a master plan approved by the planning commission. Exact building footprints are not required; however, the master plan shall be of sufficient detail to demonstrate clearly the following. 
 
 (1) Street layout showing exact location of collector and higher level streets.  
 
 (2) Approximate location of residential streets. 
 
 (3) Proposed open space. 
 
 (4) Land uses proposed. Residential uses shall indicate proposed densities for each neighborhood group. Commercial, institutional, and manufacturing uses shall indicate gross square footage in each building group. 
 
 (5) Location and proposed layout of village center(s) 
 
 (6) Adjacent land uses. 
 
 (7) Location of parks, trails, and other public uses. 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 31  Title 16 . Page 47 
16-2-48 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-48 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
 (d)  Residential densities.  The aggregate density for all residential areas combined shall not exceed six units per gross acre of land designated for residential development. 
 
 (e)  Land use allocations. The total of all non-residential land uses, excluding open space, in the village development shall not exceed 20 (twenty) percent of the total area of the development. 
 
 (f)  Design standards.  There are no set standards for street widths, setbacks, or lot coverage. These will be approved on a case-by-case basis by the planning commission based on recommendations from each municipal department. No designs will be approved which, in the estimate of a particular department head, will adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Hot Springs. 
 
 (g)  Buffer required.  Each development proposed in a Village Zoning District shall include, on all sides, an open-space buffer of not less than 75 (seventy-five) feet. This buffer shall be maintained in perpetuity and may be used as utility or drainage easements. 
 
 (h)  Conditions of approval.  The planning commission shall review each master plan and either approve or disapprove the plan based on the following criteria. 
 
 (1) Is the capacity of the existing utility system capable of serving the proposed development? 
 
 (2) Will the development create or add to existing storm water drainage on adjacent or downstream properties? 
 
 (3) Will the development meet the requirements of the city’s storm water quality management plan? 
 
 (4) Is the existing transportation network capable of providing access to the proposed development? 
 
 (5) Will the proposed development create instability in adjacent neighborhoods? 
 
 (6) Does the proposed neighborhood represent good civic design? 
 
 (7) Can the proposed development be adequately served by existing community facilities? If not, are additional facilities planned as part of the proposed development? 
 
 (8) Does the proposed development represent an efficient use of the land? 
 
 (9) What mitigating public benefits, if any, will accrue through the completion of this development? 
 
 (10) What contingency plans exist in the event that the development should fail to meet its  projected marketing goals?

16-2-49. C-TR Commercial Transitional. 
 
 (a)  Concept and description. This district promotes infill development in existing neighborhoods of the city. It also encourages innovative adaptive reuse projects. In order to protect neighborhood stability, the planning commission carefully monitors development carried out in this district. The district exists to achieve the plan objectives of promoting positive development and redevelopment of mature areas of the city. Developments carried out in the district should promote the neighborhood or village image of the area. To this end, it is important that developments carried out in this district are in keeping with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. To this end, the planning commission shall carefully evaluate proposals according to the following standards: 
 
 (1)  Will the physical components of the proposed development, i.e. size, height, bulk, type of materials, and architectural style match or complement the surrounding development? 
 
 (2)  Will the development represent a logical addition to, or extension of, surrounding development? 
 
(3)  Will the intensity of the development, i.e. traffic, parking, hours of use, level of business activity, noise levels, and signage be consistent with the current status of the neighborhood? 
 
 (4)  Would the proposed development enhance the viability of the neighborhood and not simply be proposed to circumvent the goals and objectives of the future land use plan? 
  
 (b)  Area requirements. There shall be no minimum limit to the size of this zone. 
 
 (c)  Permitted uses. Typical permitted uses in this district are single-family residences, duplexes, apartments, and customary accessory uses and structures. See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses for a complete list of permitted uses in this district. 
 
 (d)  Conditional approval. All non-residential uses shall be subject to review and approval by the commission and the commission may approve proposed uses subject to such limitations and conditions as to development and operation as it deems desirable to carry out the objectives of this district. See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses for a complete list of conditional uses in this district. 
 
Special attention shall be given to the nature and amount of non-residential activity and the appearance of the buildings and accessory facilities including parking areas, fences and signs, and to the landscape treatment of the site. There shall be no outside display of merchandise visible from the street or adjoining residential areas. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 31  Title 16 . Page 49 
16-2-49 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-49 
 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 (e)  Development plan. For all non-residential uses, site plans showing the location of buildings, accessory structures, parking areas, walks, drives, walls or fences, signs, the proposed landscape treatment and provisions for drainage, shall be submitted for planning commission approval. In addition, architectural drawings, clearly delineating the design and appearance of new buildings or of proposed remodeling of existing buildings as well as accessory structures including fences and signs also shall be submitted for commission approval. 
 
 (f)  Building limitations. Floor area ratio shall be a maximum of 40% for new construction or expansion of an existing building. This provision is not subject to variance by the city planning commission or the board of zoning adjustment. (Ord. No. 5905, §5, 11-20-2012) 
 
 (g) Building location.  
 
 (1)  Front yard - Front yard setbacks are flexible according to the design proposed by the applicant.  This will facilitate developments with parking proposed for the rear yard or side yards. The following process controls the establishing of front yard setbacks in the CTR zone: 
 
a. For front yard setbacks of 25 feet or greater, no further approval is required. 
 
  b. For proposed front yard setbacks of less than 25 feet, the applicant shall adhere to the process outlined below: 
 
   i. A site plan shall be submitted for planning commission review at least 10 days prior to the next planning commission meeting. 
 
   ii. The site plan shall be drawn to scale and shall clearly indicate the proposed location of all buildings, parking, drives, easements, rights-of-way, alignment of adjacent buildings, dumpster locations, landscaping, signage, and lighting. 
 
   iii. A written justification shall be submitted by the developer outlining why the proposed front yard setback is in harmony with other development in the area. 
 
  c. The planning commission shall consider the following in approval of front yard setbacks: 
 
   i.  That there are no existing state or municipal plans that will require additional street or utility rights-of-way. 
 
   ii.  That the proposed setback will not be out of alignment with adjoining properties. 
 
 
 
 
 
Title 16 . Page 50  Supplement No. 37 
16-2-49 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-51 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
   iii.  That the proposed setback will not pose a threat to public health, safety, and welfare. 
 
   iv.  That the proposed setback will otherwise promote good civic design in keeping with the heath, safety and public welfare of the citizens of Hot Springs. 
 
 (2) The minimum offset from side and rear lot lines shall be not less than that of the adjacent residential zone unless specifically modified by the commission as part of site plan approval.  
 
  Note: See also §16-2-107, Setbacks for Residential Infill Development. 
 
 (h)  Off-street parking. See Article X, § 16-2-103, Off-Street Parking and Loading. 
 
 (i)  Vehicles limitation. No commercial vehicles, other than panel trucks or vans of not over 3/4 ton capacity, shall be used in connection with the permitted uses. No commercial vehicles may be parked in front of the required building setback line. Commercial vehicles remaining on the site overnight shall be kept within buildings or behind solid walls or fences at least 6 feet in height. 
 
 (j)  Exterior illumination. All exterior illumination shall be so installed as to retain the light within the property. 
 
(k)  Outdoor display or storage. The outdoor display or storage of goods or materials is prohibited unless specifically approved. 
 
(l)  Certificate of compliance. No non-residential use shall be permitted until a certificate of compliance has been issued by the commission or its authorized representative indicating that architectural and site requirements have been met. 
 
16-2-50. Reserved. 
 
16-2-51. C-1 Central Business District. 
 
 (a)  Concept and description.  The Central Business District consists of that portion of the city commonly referred to as “downtown.” Because of its unique historical and cultural characteristics, the district enjoys benefits not applied to other zoning districts. These include no setbacks requirements. Also, off-street parking and landscaping are not required although the planning commission does encourage them where possible in order to improve the functioning and appearance of the area. In return, special conditions control the reconstruction of any buildings lost or demolished in the area. The planning commission may recommend expansion of the C-1 District from time to time; however, its boundaries remain fairly static and there is only one C-1 District in the city. Development in the district will focus heavily on historic development, thus multiple approvals and a long approval period are to be expected. The C-1 District is the most intensively developed district in the city and a wide variety of commercial and entertainment is allowed. Also, residential uses are encouraged in the district in order to utilize upper floors and create a resident population to support the downtown area.

16-2-52. C-2 General Business District. 
 
 (a)  Concept and description:  The General Business District represents a zone for a wide variety of retail business and services that serve a trade area but do not require such a central location as the central business district. This district serves the residents of the planning area boundary and the motoring public. This district also serves the tourist industry that is so vital to the Hot Springs area. Thus, these businesses are found on the fringe of the central business district, along major streets and arteries, at crossroads and near wholesale or industrial

areas. C-2 Businesses are most often located on less expensive real estate, allowing parking spaces, loading areas, landscaping, increased traffic, and lower concentrations of buildings. Access, circulation, intensity of uses, and the limitation of the trade area to the planning area boundary are key issues in determining the appropriateness of the C-2 Districts. 
 
 (b)  Permitted uses. Typical permitted uses in this district are retail appliance repair and sales, banks and financial offices, barber and beauty shops, bath houses and spas, business machine sales and services, commercial entertainment and recreation, day care centers, duplication shop, laundry and dry cleaning services, medical and dental offices and clinics, museums, galleries, theaters, offices, restaurants, the retail sale of food, clothing, home furnishings, and sporting goods, variety, drug, liquor and department stores, newsstands, adult uses, taverns, nightclubs, and customary accessory uses and structures. See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses, for a complete list of permitted uses in this district. 
 
 (c)  Conditional uses. Typical conditional uses in this district are bus terminals, car washes, churches, charitable institutions, clubs, lodges, community centers, convention halls, hospitals, commercial laundry plants, mortuaries, funeral homes, commercial parking lots/structures, printing and publishing, business, vocational, or art schools or colleges, and similar uses and accessory uses deemed to be in character with the zone. See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses for a complete list of conditional uses in this district. 
 
 (d) Lot dimensions. No limitations. 
 
 (e) Building location. 
 
 (1)  Front yard setbacks are flexible according to the design proposed by the applicant.  This will facilitate developments with parking proposed for the rear yard or side yards. The following process controls the establishing of front yard setbacks in the C-2 zone: 
 
  a. For front yard setbacks of 25 feet or greater, only a building permit is required. 
 
  b. For proposed front yard setbacks of less than 25 feet, the applicant shall adhere to the process outlined below: 
 
   i. A site plan shall be submitted for planning commission review at least 10 days prior to the next planning commission meeting. 
 
ii. The site plan shall be drawn to scale and shall clearly indicate the proposed location of all buildings, parking, drives, easements, rights-of-way, alignment of adjacent buildings, dumpster locations, landscaping, signage, and lighting. 
 
   iii. A written justification shall be submitted by the developer outlining why the proposed front yard setback is in harmony with other development in the area.

i. That there are no existing state or municipal plans that will require additional street or utility rights-of-way. 
 
   ii.  That the proposed setback will not be out of alignment with adjoining properties. 
 
   iii.  That the proposed setback will not pose a threat to public health, safety, and welfare. 
 
   iv.  That the proposed setback will otherwise promote good civic design in keeping with the heath, safety and public welfare of the citizens of Hot Springs. 
 
 (2)  Side yard - Corner lots – 12 feet. 
  
 (3)  Rear yards - In cases where the rear lot lines abut a residential district, the minimum offset shall be 25 feet. In individual cases, this restriction may be reduced at the judgment of the commission where it is indicated as desirable.  
 
 (f) Maximum height of buildings. No limitation. 
 
 (g) Maximum floor area ratio. Maximum F.A.R. = 0.60

16-2-54. C-3 Office/Neighborhood Commercial. 
 
 (a)  Concept and description: The C-3 District exists to allow limited commercial along with office development in proximity to residential areas. Further, the district exists to promote mixed-use developments that increase the use of non-vehicular traffic. C-3 districts also serve as proper buffers between low density residential and higher intensity commercial uses. Building masses should be modest and in scale with residential developments. Although primarily serving surrounding neighborhoods, C-3 businesses must rely upon the migration of customers from outside the neighborhood boundaries. Access and traffic circulation are key issues in their location.

16-2-55. C-4 Regional Commercial/Open Display District. 
 
 (a)  Concept and description: The C-4 represents the largest scope of commercial development in the city. The market population extends beyond the planning area boundary to a regional trade area defined by such economic standards as Reilly’s Law of Retail Gravitation, which is used to calculate the point at which customers will be drawn to one or another of two competing centers. C-4 districts should be located at major arterial interchanges so that traffic will not normally proceed into the densely populated area of the city. This district allows for regional shopping centers and so-called “big box” developments. It is also appropriate for business requiring large areas of open-display that require a large amount of land for product storage and traffic maneuvering. Potential conflicts with residential areas, control of large volumes of traffic, access to freeways and highways, and intensity of development are key issues in the location of C-4 districts. 
 
 (b)  Permitted uses. Typical permitted uses in this district are the permitted uses in all the commercial districts, and open-display uses such as vehicle sales and uses that are regionally significant such as shopping malls and large retail discount stores. Customary accessory uses and structures are also permitted uses. See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses, for a complete list of permitted uses in this district. 
 
 (c)  Conditional uses. Typical conditional uses in this district are amusement parks, bus terminals, recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds, car washes, churches, charitable institutions, clubs, lodges, community centers, hospitals, commercial laundry plants, self-storage facilities, manufactured home sales, mortuaries, funeral homes, commercial parking lots/structures, printing and publishing, race tracks, resorts, business, vocational, or art schools or colleges, animal clinics and kennels, and similar uses and accessory uses deemed to be in character with the zone.  See Article XI, § 16-2-152. Table of Permitted Uses for a complete list of conditional uses in this district. 
 
 (d) Area Requirements.  
 
 (1)  Front yard setbacks are flexible according to the design proposed by the applicant.  This will facilitate developments with parking proposed for the rear yard or side yards. The following process controls the establishing of front yard setbacks in the C-4 zone:

 ARTICLE VIII. CONDITIONAL USES 
 
16-2-70. General purposes. 
 
 The purposes of this section are to define more clearly the concept of conditional uses; to establish standards by which the planning commission shall evaluate conditional uses; and to set forth procedures for processing conditional uses. 
 
16-2-71. What is a conditional use? 
 
 A conditional use is a use that conforms to the intent of the comprehensive plan for a specific area and is generally allowable. The use may represent potential problems, however, with respect to its impact on neighboring property or to the city as a whole. For this reason, it requires a careful review of its location, design, configuration, and spatial impact to determine the desirability of allowing it on a particular site. 
 
The conditional use process must not allow an applicant to secure a use variance or as a means to circumvent the intent of the comprehensive plan or zoning code. Building configurations, footprints, and outlines should be compatible with other uses permitted for a district. Whether a proposed use is appropriate in a particular location depends upon a careful evaluation of the impacts to the neighborhood and the city by the planning commission and a weighing of conditions and methods proposed by the commission or by the applicant to ameliorate those impacts.

16-2-72. Standards for conditional uses. 
 
 The planning commission may approve, deny, defer, or modify a conditional use request based on findings of fact with regard to the standards set forth below. The appropriateness of these standards shall be determined at the discretion of the planning commission for each specific conditional use location. The planning commission shall not permit any use in a zone as a conditional use that is not permitted under the zoning code. 
 
In carrying out the purpose of this section, the commission's consideration shall include, but not be limited to, the following development standards and design specifics. The appropriateness of these standards shall be determined at the discretion of the planning commission for each specific conditional use location. 
 
 (a)  The proposed use is so designed, located and proposed to be operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected. 
 
 (b)  The proposed land use is compatible with and will not adversely affect other property in the area where it is proposed to be located. 
 
(c)  The proposed use is within the provision of "conditional uses" as set out in this Ordinance. 
 
 (d)  The proposed use conforms to all applicable provisions of this code for the zoning district in which it is to be located, and the use facilitates public convenience at that location. 
 
 (e) The size and shape of the site, and the size, shape and arrangement of the proposed structures, are in keeping with the intent of the comprehensive plan and this code. 
 
 (f)  The internal street system, ingress or egress, off-street parking, loading and pedestrian ways will be efficient and safe. 
 
 (g)  Safeguards, including, but not limited to, hours and methods of operation, landscaping and screening, controlling noxious or offensive emissions, including lighting, noise, glare, dust and odor, are satisfactory. 
 
 (h)  Landscaping, fencing and open space will be properly maintained by the owner/developer. 
 
 (i)  Proposed signs will be appropriate for the location and in accordance with the requirements of the existing city Code.

16-2-73. Conditions. 
 
 The planning commission may impose conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a conditional use permit as may be necessary to reduce or minimize the injurious effects of the conditional use, insure compatibility with the surrounding property, and carry out the general intent of this ordinance. The planning commission shall not permit any use in a zone as a conditional use that is not permitted under the zoning code. 
 
Conditions imposed as part of the conditional use may be of two types. Threshold conditions are those that must be met by all proposed developments before an application for a conditional use permit will be forwarded to the planning commission. Implicit conditions are those that the planning commission may apply during the review of an individual case. 
 
In no case shall the planning commission authorize relief from the minimum requirements of the ordinance relating to height, area, parking or screening. However, applicants may be directed to the board of zoning adjustment for variances. 
 
16-2-74. Uses exclusively conditional. 
 
 Due to their public/quasi-public nature and their potentially deleterious impact on adjacent properties, certain uses are not applicable "by right" in any zoning classification except M-1and M-2 zones. Such uses may only be placed within the city of Hot Springs as conditional uses. They are: 
 
 (a)  Airports and landing fields 
  
(1)  Helipad/Heliport/Helistop  as Conditional uses in C-2 (General Business), C-4 (Regional Commercial/Open Display), M-1 (Light Industrial), M-2(Heavy Manufacturing) and certain five-(5) acres or larger R-1 and A zones where residential use / zoning or where educational, assembly or institutional occupancy  is no nearer than 1000 feet from the perimeter of the proposed lot or parcel; and in Planned Development zone district (PD) when helipad/heliport/helistop use specifically is approved within the Planned Development Ordinance text and also upon the PD site plan applicable to the proposed site subject to full compliance with FAA requirements of construction, operation, and licensing (per Advisory Circular, AC No: 150/5390-2C and any updates). Hospital/Emergency response facilities located at or near a hospital shall be exempt. 
 
(2)  Personal use Heliport/Helipads/Helistops that are located or proposed in Districts zoned Rural Residential (R-1)or Agricultural (A)may be permitted by Conditional Use Application and Approval by Planning Commission if and only if the property is five (5) or more acres in size. Landing location shall be located at a minimum distance of 1,000 ft. of any existing residential structure.

16-2-103.3. Development standards.   
 
 The following development standards shall apply to all parking areas improved pursuant to this section.  
 
(a) Certification of minimum parking requirements.  Each application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall include information as to the location and dimensions of off-street parking space or loading space, if required, and the means of ingress and egress between such space and a street or alley.  This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Administrative Officer to determine whether or not the requirements of this Section are met.  The certificate of occupancy for the use of any building, structure or land where off-street parking space is required shall be withheld by the appropriate Administrative Officer until the provisions of this Section are fully met.  If at any time such compliance ceases, any certificate of occupancy which shall have been issued for the use of the property shall become void and of no effect.  
 
(b) Free flow of traffic and pedestrian protection.  Ingress and egress for parking facilities shall be so arranged for the free flow of vehicles at all times, so as to prevent the blocking or endangering of vehicular or pedestrian traffic through the stopping or standing of vehicles on sidewalks or streets.  No ingress or egress driveway, except for single and two family dwellings, shall be so arranged that vehicles can enter or leave the area only by backing to or from any street.  Adequate sight distances shall be maintained for vehicles and pedestrians.  
 
(c) Parking lots to be improved and maintained.  Parking lots intended to provide for the off-street parking space required by this section shall be improved and maintained with any of the following paving standards/methods: concrete; hot mix asphalt; porous concrete; and porous asphalt. 
 
Any proposed alternative paving standard/method, other than those listed above, shall be submitted to and specifically approved by the City Engineer prior to paving in accordance with Section 103.11.  However, chip and seal, and city pit (gravel/stone) shall not be permitted. 
 
(d) Maneuvering space.  No part of any parking or maneuvering space shall be located closer to any property line facing a public thoroughfare or applicable property lines than the minimum distances identified in the “Thoroughfare Buffer” and “Land Use Buffer” sections of the latest adopted version of the City of Hot Springs Landscape Ordinance.  Driveway paving for residential uses shall not be located closer than five (5) feet from side or rear property lines.

Off-street parking space for all uses of land and structures shall be provided in accordance with the “Minimum Off-Street Parking Index” as hereinafter set forth.  Parking spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be included in the principal use requirement.  The following index is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.  In any cases where a parking standard for a use is not specifically referred to in the index, its status under this section shall be determined by the Administrative Officer by reference to the most clearly analogous use or uses that are specifically referred to in the index.  When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this section results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half (1/2) or more, shall be counted as one (1) parking space.  Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time. As used in this subsection, the term “gross leasable area (GLA) shall mean t he total floor area designed for tenant occupancy.

16-2-103.7. Parking index deviations.   
 
 Due to the peculiarities of any given development, the inflexible application of the minimum off-street parking index may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of the minimum off-street parking index and may require more or allow less parking as may be deemed 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supplement No. 31  Title 16 . Page 101 
16-2-103.7 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-103.10 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
appropriate during the process of site plan review. In determining whether or  not it is appropriate to allow such deviations, the applicant shall have the burden of supplying evidence that such a change is warranted.  This evidence shall include the applicant’s experience with the same use in other jurisdictions, alternate standards (and an assessment of their adequacy) for the same use in other communities, or a suggested standard by a nationally recognized authority in parking (e.g. The Institute of Transportation Engineers, the American Planning Association, etc.). 
 
16-2-103.8. Future parking reserve.   
 
 In situations where the total parking area should not be needed in the immediate future, but may be in the longer-term, the Planning Commission may require that all of the area be provided and reserved for parking, but may suspend or waive the requirement that it actually be paved, until such time as the Administrative Officer determines that it is necessary. 
 
16-2-103.9.  Central business district.   
 
 Due to the unique character of the C-1 (Central Business District) Zoning District the standards outlined in the minimum off-street parking index shall not apply to uses or projects within the C-1 Zoning District with the exception of residences located in the district.  Section 104 hereof shall govern the off-street parking requirements for residences in commercial zones.  However, if parking lots or areas are provided in the C-1 zoning classification, those areas shall be subject to the development standards outlined in Section 16-2-103.3. Development Standards. 
 
16-2-103.10. Off-street loading requirements.   
 
 The following standards shall apply to off-street loading spaces. 
 
(a) Load space required. In any zone in connection with every building or part thereof having a gross floor area of four thousand (4,000) square feet or more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods display or sales, mortuary, or other uses similarly requiring the receipt and distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the same lot with such building or use at least one (1) off-street loading space plus one (1) additional such loading space for each ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area or major fraction thereof. 
 
(b) Space dimensions. Each loading space shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width and forty-five (45) feet in length, and shall have a minimum overhead clearance of fourteen (14) feet. 
 
(c) Space location. Such space may occupy all or any part of any required yard or court, except a front yard. 
 
 
 
Title 16 . Page 102  Supplement No. 31 
16-2-103.10 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-2-105 
 ZONING CODE 
 
 
(d) Residential restriction. No such space shall be located closer than fifty (50) feet to any lot located in any residential district, unless wholly within a completely enclosed building or unless enclosed on three sides by a wall of uniformly painted board fence or natural plantings. The height of all screening shall be determined by the administrative officer, but in no event shall the screening be less than six (6) feet in height. 
 
(e) Maneuver area. Loading spaces shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and complete the loading or unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle. 
 
 
(f) Dual use prohibited. No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities. 
 
16-2-103.11. Alternative material and methods.   
 
 Developers may propose alternative materials, methods, and designs in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council, Leadership Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) voluntary rating system.  Such proposals must include documented evidence from professional engineers, architects, or environmental planners demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed alternative materials, methods, and designs in meeting the intent and purpose of these regulations.  For purposes of this section a LEED consists of a long-term, integrated, systems approach to developing and achieving a healthy community by jointly addressing economic, environmental, and social issues.  Any such proposals must be specifically approved by the City Engineer.  
 
Editor’s note - Where a building permit has been issued prior to January 3, 2008 and provided that construction is begun within 12 months of January 3, 2008, and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in the amounts required at the time of the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this ordinance.  
 
(Ord. No. 5614, §1,2,12-4-07) 
 
16-2-104. Residences in commercial zones. 
 
 All residences located in commercial zones must meet all building, fire, and plumbing codes for residential buildings.  Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 16-2-103, with the exception of residences located in the C-1 zoning district.  No off street parking is required for residences located in the C-1 zoning district. (Ord. No. 5881, §1, 6-5-2012)

 (g) Vehicle Storage. The outside storage of vehicles, whether operable or inoperable, at service stations or repair garages shall be limited to a maximum of 45 days. (Ord. No. 5892, §2, 8-7-2012) 
 
16-2-107.  Setbacks for residential infill development. 
 
 This section shall be applied where the setback requirements of this Code would create incompatible infill development. In cases where vacant lots exist in established residential neighborhoods or subdivisions, development of said vacant lots shall be compatible with those abutting lots. The proposed infill units shall conform to any standards required by valid recorded plats, or approved, valid site plans, to the extent provided by law. Where such documentation is not available, the setbacks of the proposed infill units shall be based upon the minimum setbacks of abutting units. [Example: if a proposed infill lot abuts two single-family homes with front setbacks of 15 feet and 25 feet, the proposed unit shall be constructed with a 20 feet front setback].

 The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of urban development.  The arrangement of land parcels in the community for residential, commercial and industrial uses and for streets, alleys, schools, parks and other public purposes will determine to a large degree the conditions of health, safety, economy and amenity that prevail in the urban area.  The quality of these conditions is of public interest.  These regulations incorporate standards designed to ensure proper development of land for urban use.  The specific purposes of these regulations are: 
 
 (a) To protect and provide for the health, safety and general welfare of the public.

16-4-10.  Types of subdivisions.  
  
 The application of this code should conform to the following guidelines for subdivisions:  
 
 (a) Recognizing that subdivision regulations must be applied to various land development types, and because of the special conditions pertaining to each, these regulations hereby provide for the establishment of six (6) subdivision types: commercial/office, industrial, manufactured home park, manufactured home subdivision, residential and minor subdivisions and incidental submissions.  Design standards applicable to each of these six (6) types are outlined in later sections of these regulations. 
 
 (b) Prior to the approval of any subdivision improvement plans, the planning commission shall classify and evaluate each subdivision according to its planned future use, it being the responsibility of the applicant to identify the type on the proposed plat.  Where a proposed plat incorporates more than one (1) use of the type specified in these regulations, either the different land use types shall be clearly delineated on the submitted preliminary plat, or separate plats shall be filed for each land use type together with a scale drawing illustrating the proposed layout as a totality. 
 
 (c) The purpose and intent of each subdivision type shall be generally as follows: 
 
  (1) Commercial or office subdivisions are intended to accommodate one (1) or more commercial building sites on either single or multiple lots in a carefully planned configuration designed to protect and enhance the viability of each separate structure and ownership. 
 
  (2) Industrial subdivisions are intended to fulfill a two-fold objective: 
 
   a. To provide both opportunity and flexibility for industrial activities to take place at appropriate locations in a compatible manner with adjacent non-manufacturing areas. 
 
   b. To apply sound design principles and orderly development to industrial parcels through the creation of one (1) or more building sites or lots.

  (3) Manufactured home subdivisions are intended to ensure proper layout and development of lots for manufactured home occupancy by establishing appropriate standards for density, spacing and placement and by requiring off-street parking, storage facilities and open space.  These regulations are intended to facilitate location of manufactured homes within the jurisdiction of these regulations by making available appropriate sites for such occupancy. 
 
  (4) Manufactured home parks are intended to ensure proper layout and development of manufactured homes spaces for lease or rent by establishing appropriate standards for density, spacing and placement and requiring off-street parking, storage facilities and open space.  These regulations are intended to facilitate location of manufactured home parks within the planning area by making available appropriate sites for such occupancy. 
 
  (5) Residential subdivisions are intended to ensure efficient, aesthetic and convenient designs for single-family, zero-lot line, duplex and multifamily residential development, and to provide harmonious relationships with surrounding areas. 
 
  (6) Minor subdivisions and incidental submissions are intended to provide review standards for small subdivisions, lot splits, recombinations and lot-line adjustments of a minor nature.

16-4-11.  Plat recording and improvements required.  
 The following regulations shall govern the recording of plats and issuance of construction permits for large scale developments and subdivisions:  
 
 (a)   No subdivision plat or any part thereof shall be recorded prior to obtaining final plat approval from the planning department, nor shall anyone convey title to any lot or lots before obtaining final plat approval and recording the final plat with the Garland County Circuit Clerk. The filing of record of metes and bounds legal descriptions for any property or parcel contained within an active preliminary plat shall void said preliminary plat approval. 
 
  (b)   No building permit, plumbing or other permits shall be issued for construction of any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold, nor for any large scale development, in violation of the provisions of these regulations or local, state or federal laws within the corporate limits of the City of Hot Springs or the planning area as applicable. Provided, further, that no permits shall be issued until the final plat has been approved and the infrastructure improvements have been constructed or bond provided in accordance with the applicable development ordinance. 
 
(c)  No building permit, plumbing or other applicable permits shall be issued for construction of any building or structure on any tract of land within the corporate limits of the City of Hot Springs until the plans for such building or structure is approved in writing by the planning director or his authorized representative. 
 
(d)  The city will not permit any development on a lot in a subdivision for which a plat has been filed and recorded but neither infrastructure improvements have been constructed nor bond provided in accordance with the applicable development ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 5835, §2, 9-6-2011)  
 
16-4-12.  Re-subdivision of land.  
 When applying to re-subdivide land, the following guidelines shall be followed: 
 
 (a) Previously platted lots served by an existing street system may be recombined without re-platting, provided that there is no increase in the number of lots and no increase in the number or extent of non-conformities of size, shape or open space.

 (b) Previously platted lots or series of lots returned to acreage by court order or which were formerly provided access from rights-of-way which have been abandoned shall be re-subdivided in conformance with these regulations prior to issuance of any permits for construction.  The reduction to acreage or abandonment of street right-of-way shall constitute abandonment of the former lots of record. 
 
16-4-13.  Vacation of plats.  
 
 Any plat or any part of any plat lying within the corporate limits of the city may be vacated by the owner pursuant to the procedure set forth in A.C.A. §14-41-301 et. seq. (Reduction to Acreage).  Any plat lying outside the city limits and within the planning area may be vacated by action of the appropriate county authority in accordance with applicable state law (A.C.A. §14-18-109). 
 
16-4-14.  Conformance to zoning. 
 
 All subdivisions and large scale development projects shall conform to all provisions of the applicable zoning district regulations in which the proposed development or subdivision is located.  No provision of the proposed subdivision plat or development site plan shall override such zoning requirements.  No waiver shall be requested or approved which would conflict in any way with the applicable zoning requirements.  Any subdivision or large scale development project located in a portion of the planning area not subject to zoning regulations, shall conform to the applicable standards as set forth in Article IV (Standards) hereof.  
 
16-4-15.  Waivers.  
 
 The application of this code should conform to the following guidelines for waivers.  
 
 (a) The rules and regulations set forth in these regulations are the standard requirements of the city.  Where the applicant alleges that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, or the purpose of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, the planning department shall review such requests for waivers and the planning department shall forward its recommendation to the planning commission for final action so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured.  Such waivers, however, shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.  The following criteria shall be used to determine whether a waiver shall be granted: 
 
  (1) The conditions upon which the request for waiver is based are unique to the property because of its particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions. 
 
  (2) The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare of, or injurious to other property. 
 
  
 
 
 
 Supplement No. 33  Title 16 . Page 123

 SUBDIVISIONS 
 
 
  (3) The waiver will not in any manner vary the provisions of the applicable zoning regulations.  Provided, however, that the planning commission may consider and approve requests for building set-back waivers at the preliminary plat stage.  If approved, such set-back waivers shall be so noted on the final plat. 
 
  (4) Pecuniary hardship, standing alone, shall not constitute grounds for the granting of a waiver or variance. 
 
 (b) No waiver shall be granted except upon written petition by the developer when the preliminary plat or site plan is filed for consideration by the planning commission.  The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts upon which the petition is made.  In approving waivers, the planning commission may, at its option, require special conditions to ensure development in accordance with objectives, standards and requirements of this code. 
 
 (c) In those instances where a recorded final subdivision plat has established building setback lines in accordance with zoning regulations, waivers of those lines shall only be granted by the board of zoning adjustment upon application for a re-plat and review and recommendation by the planning department. Waiver requests of the set back standards established by this code for such subdivisions located in any portions of the planning area not subject to zoning regulations shall be considered by the planning commission.  The planning commission or board of zoning adjustment shall review each building line waiver request for hardship circumstances as required by the applicable zoning regulations. Any such waivers  approved by the board of zoning adjustment or the planning commission shall be reflected on a final re-plat of the subject lots which shall be signed by the planning director and recorded in the office of the circuit clerk of the county.  A bill of assurance amendment shall not be required by the review process nor shall the planning director sign a bill of assurance.  The owner or applicant shall be instructed to review the filing procedure with the circuit clerk should a revised bill of assurance be required by that office.  Platting costs shall be borne by the applicant or owner. 
 
16-4-16.  Amendments and modifications.  
 
 The holder of an approved large-scale development site plan or any subdivision plat may request modification thereof or the conditions of approval by submitting an amended plan or plat which shall be filed and processed in the same manner as the original application.  However, the planning director may approve such minor changes in the site plans and subdivision plats so as to not cause any of the following circumstances to occur: 
 
 (a) Any change in the allowable use of the development. 
 
 (b) Any increase of greater than five (5) percent in the number of dwelling units but not to exceed the total allowable dwelling units in the respective zoning classification for projects subject to zoning regulations.

 (a) The aggrieved party shall request an appeal by filing a "notice of appeal" with the planning department not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the planning commission’s final action.  The notice of appeal shall be filed on such form(s) as may be prescribed by the planning department.  The city clerk shall prepare a proposed resolution for consideration at the next regular meeting of the board of directors in accordance with the board’s agenda preparation rules and procedures. 
 
 (b) Appeals shall be heard by the board of directors de novo whereby the board shall hear and decide to grant or deny an application based on all the evidence presented to the board, including the planning commission record, as well as any other proof either party may wish to place before the board.  The legislation shall be worded in the affirmative and the board may vote to either grant or deny the application.

 (a) The purpose of this section is to accomplish the goals of the City of Hot Springs Comprehensive Plan and affect observance of the Arkansas Fire Prevention Code.  
 
 (b) Multiple building sites and large scale development sites pose a higher degree of potential impact, both positive and negative, to the orderly growth and development of the City of Hot Springs and are therefore subject to a close scrutiny of these potential impacts. This review is a streamlined method for more complex projects to receive multiple city department review by a single application, thereby reducing multiple submittals and saving time.

 (3) Reserved. 
 
16-4-22. Site plan review, form and content. 
 
 (a) Site plan review is a development process that provides for case by case consideration of project particulars where many of the individual components of a project are verified as compliant with the appropriate codes and ordinances in a single step. This does not forego the requirements of subdividing. All subdivisions, as defined in this code, shall be administered in accordance with the requirements of those sections. Subdivision platting shall precede site planning for multiple building lease or sales sites.  
 
 (b) A site plan shall be submitted for review as a large scale development or multiple building site and shall show all pertinent information including:

 ARTICLE III.   SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL AND REVIEW 
 
16-4-41.  General procedure. 
 
 The planning commission shall exercise the power and authority to review, approve or deny plats for subdivisions and improvements in accordance with these regulations.  In this regard, the application procedures and approval process for subdivision development shall be accomplished in four (4) steps, as follows: 
 
 (a) Pre-application conference.  The first step consists of a pre-application conference.  This step involves an informal discussion with the planning department and the submission of a sketch plan containing the information required hereinafter.  The pre-application procedure affords the developer the opportunity to obtain the advice and assistance of the planning department early and informally in order to: 
 
  (1) Assist the developer in analyzing the development plan. 
 
  (2) Give informal guidance to the development at a stage when potential points of difference can be more easily resolved, thus simplifying official actions and saving unnecessary expense and delay to the developer.

Advice of the planning department shall be provided in either verbal or written form at the option of the developer within thirty (30) days of the sketch plan submission.  It shall be binding on neither the city nor the developer.   
 
 (b) Development plan and preliminary plat.  The second step involves preparation, by the applicant or applicant’s agent, of development plans and a preliminary plat for consideration by the planning commission and various city departments and agencies.  These documents are designed to show the proposed subdivision in sufficient detail to indicate its workability in all respects with all the details fully computed.  A developer proposing to subdivide within the city or planning area of the planning commission shall not proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, excluding clearing subject to applicable storm water permitting requirements but including grading, before obtaining preliminary plat and development plan approval.  The development plan shall include detailed construction specifications and plans as required by the street, drainage, stormwater, fire prevention and municipal utility codes. 
 
 
 (c) Final plat.  The third step involves submission of a final plat conforming to the approved preliminary plat.  This step shall be initiated not later than two (2) years after approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission unless an extension has been granted. The final plat is a completed document incorporating survey documentation in a form required for legal record and sale of lots. 
 
 (d) Public infrastructure acceptance.  The fourth step involves acceptance of all public dedications, improvements and utilities as prescribed in these regulations by the city and/or county. 
 
16-4-42.  Development plan and preliminary plat application and consideration 
                procedure. 
 
 The following procedure shall apply to the submission, consideration and approval of development plans and preliminary plats. 
 
 (a) Whenever a subdivision is proposed and before any sale of lots located in said subdivision as a whole or any part thereof is made or structures constructed, the owner shall file an application for consideration of the proposed subdivision with the planning department.  The applicant shall remit all the necessary fees and submit all necessary documents, plans and plats as required by these subdivision regulations and in accordance with such application filing deadlines as established by the planning commission or planning department. 
 
 (b) Upon receipt of a complete application, the planning department shall cause to be distributed copies of the development plan and preliminary plat to other city departments, utility companies, and county and state agencies as appropriate, who shall review the proposed subdivision for conformance with these subdivision regulations and applicable elements of the comprehensive plan.  In their review, the various departments and agencies shall take into consideration the requirements of the community and the use of the land being subdivided and

may offer suggestions concerning changes to enable the project to meet the purpose and intent of these regulations.  Particular attention shall be given to width, arrangement and location of streets; utility easements; drainage; lot sizes and arrangements; and other facilities such as parks, playgrounds, trails or school sites, public buildings, parking areas and arterial streets; and the relationship of the proposed subdivision to adjoining, existing, proposed and possible subdivision of lands. 
 
 (c) Recommendations and comments from the various departments and agencies shall be provided to the planning department in such manner as prescribed by the planning department.  The planning department shall forward such recommendations and comments, if any, to the planning commission along with the planning department’s own comments and recommendation. 
 
 (d) The planning commission shall review the development plans and preliminary plat along with the comments from the various reviewing departments and agencies and the planning department’s recommendation for approval, disapproval or modification. 
 
 (e) The planning commission shall review the preliminary plat at its regularly scheduled or special called meeting.  The planning commission shall then approve, conditionally approve, deny or defer the plat.  Notification of the planning commission’s decision and reason for such decision shall be provided in writing to the developer within ten (10) business days of the planning commission’s action. 
 
 (f) Development plans and preliminary plat approved by the planning commission shall be effective and binding upon the commission for two (2) years from the date of planning commission approval at the end of which time the final plat application for the subdivision must have been approved by the planning department unless an extension has been duly granted.  Any plat not receiving final approval within the period of time set forth herein or otherwise conforming to the requirements shall be null and void, and the developer shall be required to submit new development plans and preliminary plat of the property for preliminary approval subject to all zoning restrictions, if any, and these regulations. 
 
 (g) Upon receipt of a written request fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of the preliminary plat, the planning director may extend the original preliminary plat approval, for up to one (1) year, when it can be demonstrated that there are no changes in the plat design or neighborhood that warrant a complete review. 
 
 (h) Approval of the development plans and preliminary plat shall be evidenced by the planning director’s execution of the Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval. 
 
 (i) Receipt by the developer of the executed certificate of development plans and preliminary plat approval is his authorization to proceed with the installation of required public improvements.  The developer shall construct all improvements to the specifications of the approved development plans.  Construction work shall be subject to on-site inspections by the city to verify conformance with the approved construction plans.

 (j) If the application is conditionally approved by the planning commission,  such conditions shall be agreed to by the applicant and necessary changes made to the development plans and preliminary plat before the Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval can be executed by the planning director. 
 
 (k) Within thirty (30) days of the commission's action, a denied application may be resubmitted to the planning department for review of the required modifications and re-submission to the planning commission.  Any such re-submission must be accompanied by payment of fifty percent (50%) of the otherwise applicable fees.  The failure to resubmit an application within the prescribed period of time shall invoke procedures required for the filing of a new application. 
 
 (l) The planning commission may defer action on a preliminary plat no more than twice before taking action on the request. 
 
16-4-43.  Bill of assurance. 
 
 (a) A draft bill of assurance, if any, shall be submitted to the planning department for review and approval with the preliminary plat and a final copy containing any revisions with the final plat.  Such document shall incorporate but not necessarily be limited to the following:  Offering dedications of streets and alleys, parks and other public lands; establishing easements, setting forth privileges and conditions pertaining thereto, and setting forth the restrictions and covenants of the subdivision; setting forth procedures by which amendments to the bill of assurance can be made.  The final bill of assurance shall contain reference to the approval of the final plat. 
 
 (b) Where minimum floor elevations are required to be placed on the final plat, the source of the information by which the elevation was obtained shall be shown on both the plat and contained in the bill of assurance.  The bill of assurance shall contain language advising the property owner to verify the most current information available on the status of flooding on the property.   
 
 (c) Where private streets are included within the subdivision, the final bill of assurance shall include a statement that such streets are private and not under the care and custody of the city or county and will, therefore, not be maintained by the city or county.  
 
16-4-44.  Final plat review and consideration procedure. 
 
 (a) A developer seeking approval of a final plat shall submit the necessary application form and final plat documents to the planning department.

 SUBDIVISIONS 
 
 (d) Responsibility for final plat approval shall reside with the planning director, who shall approve or disapprove the final plat within thirty (30) days of the submission thereof, unless the developer agrees in writing to deferral. No final plat shall be approved until its conformance with the development plans, preliminary plat and the survey requirements within these regulations have been verified.  Approval of the final plat shall be accomplished when the planning director signs the certificate of final plat approval as shown on the plat. 
 
(e) The applicant shall be responsible for filing the approved plat for record in Garland County Circuit Clerk’s office within thirty (30) days of its approval and the execution of the certificate of final plat by the Planning Director.  Failure to so record shall render such plat null and void. (Ord. No. 6079, '1, 7-7-2015) 


 
 (f) Any plat submitted for final plat approval not in conformance with the approved preliminary plat as determined by the planning director shall be denied.  If the final plat is denied, such decision shall be communicated to the developer in written form expressing the reasons therefore within five (5) days after such determination is made.  Any plat applications denied by the planning director may be appealed to the planning commission for action. 
 
 (g) The developer may, in conformance with the provisions of these regulations, seek final plat approval for only a portion of the property for which the preliminary plat was approved in accordance with the preliminary plat phasing plan.  For residential plats, however, such phasing shall contain no less than ten (10) percent (in no case fewer than five (5) lots) of the total number of lots contained within the approved preliminary plat.  Plats containing fewer than six (6) lots shall not be phased unless specifically authorized by the planning commission. The developer shall not omit segments of streets from a phase that would be required to serve adjacent developing areas. 
 
 (h) The final plat may be approved prior to completion of infrastructure construction provided all the assurances and bonding as required in Article IV (Standards) have been provided. 
 
16-4-45.  Consideration of minor subdivisions and incidental submissions.  
 
 The provisions of this section shall govern the consideration and approval of minor subdivisions and lot splits, recombination, re-plats or lot-line adjustments (hereafter termed incidental submissions). 
 
 (a)  This section shall apply to the following circumstances: 
 
  (1) Lot splits in which a single unsubdivided, tract or parcel is being split into two lots meeting minimum lot requirements of these regulations and any applicable zoning regulations.  For purposes of these regulations, undivided parcels (lots of record) are eligible for a lot split only once. Any further divisions of the original or the newly created parcel shall be considered a subdivision in accordance with these regulations.  The lot split plat shall describe and depict the original lot of record as the parent parcel and such plat shall include a note stating: This plat represents an approved lot split. Any further division hereof must meet the requirements for a subdivision in accordance with Hot Springs Subdivision Code.  
 
  (2) Minor subdivisions containing no more than four (4) lots, in which all lots front an existing public street.  Minor subdivisions shall not include any subdivision which is part of a larger tract to be developed in phases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Supplement 2016  Title 16 . Page 133 
16-4-45 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-4-45 
 SUBDIVISIONS 
 
 
  (3) Recombination of ten (10) or fewer lots in which all lots front a public street. 
 
  (4) Replats of existing lots or lot line adjustments in existing subdivisions in which there are ten (10) or fewer lots considered for replat. 
 
  (5) Lot-line adjustments to change property lines of existing parcels. This process can be used to combine two (2) or more adjacent parcels into one (1) parcel, alter the boundary between two (2) parcels, make survey corrections in lot lines, or reconfigure the shapes of parcels.  In every instance, however, the lot line adjustment process must result in the same number, or fewer, of parcels as there was prior to the adjustment. The lot line adjustment process shall not be used to create additional parcels. 
 
 (b) The planning commission hereby delegates to the planning director authority to approve plats for minor subdivisions and incidental submissions meeting the requirements of this section; provided, however, that the planning director may request planning commission review at his discretion.  The planning director does not, however, have authority to disapprove minor subdivisions or incidental submissions.  Should, in the opinion of the planning director, a minor subdivision or incidental submission not meet the requirements of this section, the planning director, at the request of the applicant, shall forward the request to the planning commission for consideration in accordance with the planning commission’s meeting procedures. 
 
 (c) Approval of minor subdivisions or incidental subdivisions may be granted by the planning director only if the following threshold guidelines are met: 
 
  (1) No new street or alley is required. 
 
  (2) No vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required or proposed. 
 
  (3) Such action will not result in any significant increases in public service requirements, nor will interfere with maintaining existing public service levels. 
  (4) There is adequate street right-of-way as required by these regulations and the master street plan. 
 
  (5) All easement requirements have been satisfied. 
 
  (6) All lots created by such split or readjusted shall have direct access to a public street. 
 
  (7) No substandard sized lots or parcels shall be created. 
 
(8) No waivers or variances from these regulations are requested.

  (9) No public improvements, including utility mains or other appurtenances are required. 
 
  (10) The submission does not represent the piecemeal development of a larger development that seeks to avoid the spirit and intent of the comprehensive plan or this code.  
 
 (d) Submission and approval of minor subdivisions shall be considered as a combined preliminary and final plat.  In this regard, the applicant shall meet the submission requirements for a development plan, preliminary plat and final plat including payment of all prescribed fees. 
 
 (e) All minor subdivision and incidental submissions shall be submitted to the various city departments for review and comments prior to approval. 
 
 (f) Request for incidental submissions, other than minor subdivisions, shall be made by the owner of the land to the planning department on such application forms and in such manner as may be prescribed by the planning director or planning commission.  The application fee for incidental submissions shall be the amount prescribed for a preliminary plat.  The application shall be accompanied by a professionally prepared plat drawn to scale of the lot(s) or parcel(s) involved.  The plat shall include the items specified for incidental submissions and such other information as may be required by the planning director in order to determine if the application meets the requirements for approval as an incidental submission. 
 
 (g) The planning director shall, in writing, either approve or forward the proposed  minor subdivision or incidental submission to the planning commission within thirty (30) days of application.  Approved plats shall be signed by the planning director and filed with the county circuit clerk.

16-4-63.  Sidewalks.  
 
Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards in addition to the requirements of this code. 
 
16-4-64.  Storm drainage.  
 
 In order to insure adequate drainage, the following guidelines shall be observed:  
 
 (a) Every subdivision shall make adequate provisions to accommodate or dispose of stormwater by means of drains, sewers, catch basins, culverts and other facilities deemed necessary by the city. 
 
 (b) Drainage facilities within the City of Hot Springs shall meet the minimum requirements of the Hot Springs Drainage Specifications Ordinance and the Hot Springs Stormwater Ordinance in addition to the requirements of this code.

(a) Any developer of land who proposes to make or has made a subdivision of land shall conform to any duly adopted city or county master plans by indicating on any plats or drawings submitted to the commission for its consideration any and all proposed public facilities which are located within the property, and shall plat the public lands to the dimensions and in the location determined by the commission.  Such public land shall be reserved for acquisition by the city or county.  Such acquisition must be made within twelve (12) months from the date the developer’s preliminary plat is approved by the planning commission.  Acquisition shall be deemed as having been made when either an option to purchase is executed or litigation to condemn is filed by the city or county.  No developer shall be denied the privilege of having a preliminary plat approved solely by reason of the issue of reserved public land unless the city or county determines and advises the developer, within sixty (60) days from the date, his preliminary plat is approved by the planning commission, that public funds for the acquisition of such public lands will be available within twelve (12) months from the date the preliminary plat is approved.

 SUBDIVISIONS 
 
 (b) Whenever the planning commission is presented with a request for consideration of a preliminary plat involving the expansion of any mapped existing public facility, or a proposed public facility, the commission shall require, in conjunction with the approval of the preliminary plat, reservation of the public land. 
 
 (c) No building, plumbing or other construction permit shall be issued for any structure on any lot or parcel on which any proposed public lands are indicated unless it has first been determined that the proposed structure would not lie within the proposed bounds of the public lands.  Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed to deny a permit for the use of such lot or parcel for purposes not involving the construction or relocation of buildings. 
 
 (d) All applicable master plans shall be duly considered prior to action on any matter related thereto which comes before the planning commission, the board of directors, or any of the departments, agencies, boards or commissions of the city. 
 
 (e) This section shall not apply to the provision by the developer of utility easements or right-of-way dedications for public roads, streets and alleys as otherwise required by these regulations. 
 
16-4-66.  Streets - Generally.  
 
 In order to insure the safe travel of the public, the following guidelines shall apply to creation of streets: 
 
 (a) Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. Street grades and alignment shall conform reasonably to the original topography. In steep areas, through streets should generally follow contour lines rather than cross them.  Combinations of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.  Sudden and frequent changes of grade along any street shall be avoided.  Sharp horizontal curvature should be avoided, if possible, at or near the high point of a crest, vertical curve or near the low point of a pronounced sag or vertical curve. 
 
 (b) The proposed street layout shall be properly integrated with the street system in the area adjoining the subdivision.  The layout shall also conform to the existing and proposed land uses and the most advantageous development pattern for the surrounding area. 
 
 (c) Major traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, shopping centers, and residential developments with a density in excess of eighteen (18) units per gross acre shall obtain primary access from streets classified as collectors and above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Title 16 . Page 148         Supplement No. 33 
16-4-66 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-4-67 
 SUBDIVISIONS 
 
 
 (d) Local residential streets shall be laid out to permit efficient drainage and utility systems and to require the minimum length of pavement necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.   
 
 (e) Proposed through streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless the planning commission has specifically determined that such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
 
 (f) Every subdivision shall be served by an adequate system of publicly dedicated streets or their private counterparts as specified in these regulations.  All public streets within the subdivision shall be located, platted and dedicated to the city or county in accordance with any duly adopted master street plans and the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance. 
 
 (g) New boundary streets shall be avoided except where a requirement of the master street plan provides a defined alignment.  In that event, the developer shall provide one-half of the master street plan’s specified improvements and right-of-way.  Whenever a proposed subdivision abuts a partially dedicated or constructed public street, the developer shall provide the minimum of one-half of the required improvements and right-of-way.  The planning commission may authorize a new boundary street when the developer proposes to dedicate the entire right-of-way and construct all the required improvements.  In no case shall a developer retain a parcel of land lying between a newly created boundary street and a former property line, the purpose of which would be to deny access by abutting owners. 
 
 (h) For purposes of determining the extent of the required improvements on boundary streets, the right-of-way centerline shall be deemed to be the plat boundary.  Where a clearly defined right-of-way does not exist, the city engineer shall establish the centerline location. 
 
 (i) Streets within a subdivision or large scale development shall be designed and constructed in strict accordance with the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance in addition to the requirements of this code. 
 
 (j) The subdivision or large scale development street system shall connect to a public street(s) accepted by the city or county of sufficient capacity to accommodate the subdivision or development. 
 
16-4-67.  Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs.  
 
 Creation of dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall adhere to the following guidelines:  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Supplement No. 33  Title 16 . Page 149 
16-4-67 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-4-68 
 SUBDIVISIONS 
   
 (a) Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length of 800 feet and as governed by the Fire Prevention Code.  Where a street does not extend to the boundary of a subdivision, and its continuation is not necessary for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall not be closer than fifty (50) feet to such boundary. 
 
 (b) Cul-de-sac turnarounds shall be provided at the end of all permanent dead-end streets.  Cul-de-sac turnarounds shall have a minimum right-of-way diameter and a pavement diameter as governed by the Fire Prevention Code. 
 
 (c) In the case of temporary dead-end streets, which are stub streets designed to provide future connections with unsubdivided adjacent areas or future phases, the planning commission may require a temporary easement for a turnaround. 
 
 (d) In the case of temporary dead-end streets which are stub streets designed to provide future connection with unsubdivided adjacent areas or future phases, the developer shall provide information in the bill of assurance confirming such anticipated future extensions.  It is the purpose of this requirement to convey to street users information as to continuation of the street and its intended classification. 
 
16-4-68.  Intersections and alignment.  
 
 The application of this code for intersections and street alignment should conform to the following guidelines. 
 
 (a) Street intersections shall be laid out as nearly at right angles as possible and may be curved to bring this about.  The centerline of no more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.  No intersection shall be at an angle of less than eighty-five (85) degrees. 
 
 (b) Intersections shall be designed with grades as level as possible consistent with proper provision for drainage. 
 
 (c) Additional street paving and right-of-way in the form of turning lanes shall normally be required along arterial streets at intersections with other arterial or collectors streets. 
 
 (d) Property line corners at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of at least twenty-five (25) feet. 
 
 (e) Where visibility at any proposed street intersection would be impeded by earthen berms or existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and vegetation in conjunction with the grading of the street right-of-way sufficient to provide adequate site distance as specified in the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance or other city or county regulations governing intersection visibility. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Title 16 . Page 150  Supplement No. 33

 (f) Street intersections shall be located to avoid creating hazardous driving conditions. 
 
16-4-69.  New private streets.  
 
 Creation of new private streets shall comply with the requirements of this section. 
 
 (a) Private streets shall be discouraged.  However, private streets may be approved by the planning commission to serve isolated developments.  The design standards for approved private streets shall conform to the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance for public streets.  
 
 (b) Private streets are permissible only in the form of cul-de-sacs and loop streets and only when it has been determined that these streets can be adequately accessed by all public service vehicles.  Such streets will not be permitted where there is a possibility of through traffic or eventual connection to another public street.  It shall be incumbent upon the developer to demonstrate that the private streets will not unreasonably limit access to adjacent parcels, hinder logical traffic pattern or otherwise be contrary to the public interest.   
 
 (c) The developer shall provide for permanent maintenance of all private streets in the bill of assurance.  The bill of assurance shall clearly state that such private streets are not under the care and control of the city or county and will, therefore, not be maintained by the city or county.  
 
 (d) A private driveway or street section servicing three (3) or more lots or parcels shall be considered a street and subject to the construction requirements for a public street.  Private drives may only serve no more than two lots or parcels.   
 
 (e) The developer shall provide for permanent maintenance of water and sewer mains and related facilities within the development in the bill of assurance.  Provided, however, that the developer may enter into contracts with the City of Hot Springs (Hot Springs Municipal Utilities)  for the maintenance of all water and sewer mains and hydrants lying within the private street right-of-way if approved by the city. 
 
 (f) Streets within a gated development or to which public access is restricted shall be private streets and may not be accepted for maintenance by the city or county. 
 
 (g) Private streets shall be so noted on the final plat and the bill of assurances shall include a notation in substantially the following form: “The streets in this development are private streets and will therefore not be accepted for perpetual maintenance by the city or county”.

16-4-70.  Existing public or private streets.  
 
 The planning commission shall review and determine acceptance of the dedication of existing private streets when part of new street plans as provided in this section. 
 
 (a) Principal access right-of-way only is allowed. Alley dedications shall be discouraged. 
 
 (c) Streets and alleys which had been previously dedicated to the county will become city streets upon annexation and acceptable by the city and will thereafter be maintained by the city as a city street and/or alley. 
 
 (d) Existing streets and alleys which had been previously fully or periodically maintained by the county for which there is no recorded dedication (prescriptive streets and alleys) shall be considered for acceptance and maintenance by the city upon annexation in accordance with the city’s street acceptance policy.  The planning commission may require that such streets or alleys be constructed or re-constructed in accordance with the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance as part of the subdivision development plan whether or not annexation is an issue.   
 
 (e) Streets or alleys which were private in every respect shall remain private after annexation.  Owners of properties abutting such streets or alleys may request dedication by following the procedures outlined for submission of preliminary plats.  Dedication of right-of-way for alleys shall provide a tie to the public street system at both ends or meet the requirements for a cul-de-sac or dead-end street. 
 
 (f) A review committee consisting of the planning director and the city engineer shall evaluate each incidence whereby dedication is an issue. A recommendation in written form shall be made on each qualifying request and presented to the commission at a public hearing.  The committee shall act in the capacity of technical advisor only to the planning commission. Appeals from decisions or actions of the planning commission may be filed with the board of directors. 
 
 (g) The planning commission shall determine that a need exists for a public street. 
 
 (h) Citizens desiring to dedicate private streets shall assume all costs to include platting, engineering, and construction in accordance with city or county street acceptance procedures. 
 
 (i) No street shall be offered or reviewed for dedication where no structure abuts the right-of-way or where such action would circumvent the subdivision code review for new streets or subdivisions. 
 
 (j) In those instances where a private road was created by land sales constituting a violation of these regulations or any previous subdivision ordinance, the property from which the road was derived shall be included in preliminary plat submissions.

  (1) The street proposed will be located within a dedicated right-of-way of not less than that required by the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance. 
 
  (2) The pavement surface and thickness must meet the requirements of the Hot Springs Street Specifications Ordinance. 
 
  (3) The city engineer may require proof of pavement base course and subgrade conditions during the technical review of the street, only after submission of a plat. 
 
  (4) Horizontal and vertical curves and other geometric conditions of the street must be judged safe for existing and future traffic conditions. 
 
  (5) Dead-end streets shall provide an adequate turnaround for sanitation and emergency vehicles both in dimension and improvements. 
 
  (6) The street shall have sufficient crown to permit normal drainage from the pavement surface without flooding the centerline. 
 
  (7) Street side drainage ditches shall be permitted except in those cases where the planning commission determines that curb and gutter and underground drainage is the only feasible method to handle the drainage. 
 
  (8) All drainage structures within the right-of-way shall be of sufficient size and type construction to meet the requirements of the Hot Springs Drainage Specifications Ordinance or be judged adequate by the city engineer. 
 
  (9) Street grades and intersection approach grades shall meet the street specifications or be judged satisfactory for existing and future traffic conditions. 
 
  (10) Utility alignment and depth shall meet all city policies or be judged satisfactory by the city or utility engineer.  The applicant shall show all existing or proposed utilities on the dedication application. 
 
  (11) The planning commission may designate drainage, utility or public use easements as required to maintain the street.

 The historic district commission shall adopt and publish such guidelines as are necessary to implement the provisions of this article and inform property owners within the historic district and the general public of the criteria for reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
 
 In making its determination, the commission shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria: 
 
(a) Proposed alterations, restorations, new construction, moving or demolition in the historic district shall respect and relate to the special character of the district. Changes shall be evaluated on basis of: 
 
(1) The purpose of this article; 
 
(2) The architectural or historic value or significance of a building and its relationship to the surrounding area; 
 
(3) The general compatibility of proposed changes; and, 
 
(4) Any other factor, including visual and aesthetic, considered pertinent. 
 
(b) Repairs considered as part of a building's ordinary maintenance are those that do not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, as defined in section 16-7-1 of this article. These repairs shall not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
 
(c) The commission shall encourage proposed changes which reflect the original design of the structure, based on photographs, written description or other historical documentation, and be guided by the following preferences: 
 
(1) It is preferable to preserve by maintenance rather than to repair original features of the building. 
 
(2) It is preferable to repair rather than to reconstruct if possible. 
 
(3) It is preferable to restore by reconstruction original features rather than to remove or remodel. 
 
4) Contemporary design shall not be excluded from consideration. 
 
(d) When evaluating the general compatibility of alterations to the exterior of any building in the historic district, the commission shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors within the building's area of influence: 
 
  (1) Siting; 
  (2) Height; 
  (3) Proportion; 
  (4) Rhythm; 
  (5) Roof area; 
  (6) Entrance area; 
 
 
 Title 16 . Page 193  Supplement No. 33 
 
16-7-11 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-7-12 
 HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
 
 
  (7) Wall areas; 
  (8) Detailing; 
  (9) Facade; 
  (10) Scale; 
  (11) Setback; and, 
  (12) Massing. 
 
These terms are defined in section 16-7-1, above. 
 
(e) Additions to existing buildings, including installation of awnings or new signs, shall be judged in the same manner as new construction and shall complement the design of the original building, including exterior window sizes, door heights and ceiling heights, and should not interfere with any outstanding architectural feature. Decoration of the exterior should blend with, if not specifically match, existing exterior features such as window casements, window hoods, cornices, roof line, facade materials, foundation materials and types of windows. The authority of the central business improvement district (CBID) to review applications for signs and awnings is hereby abolished and vested exclusively in the commission. 
 
(f) Generally, new construction shall be judged on its ability to blend with the existing downtown area and area of influence. The commission shall consider, but not be limited to, the factors listed for alterations in subsection (d) of this section. 
 
(g) If a certificate of appropriateness is requested to demolish a building or other structure within the district, the applicant shall state the post-demolition plans for the site, and furnish detailed plans of the proposed reconstruction. (Ord. No. 3944, § 4, 3-21-88) 
 
16-7-12.  Evaluation of application; notice to property owners within area of 
    influence; applications for demolition. 
 
 (a) Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic district commission shall make a preliminary determination as to the properties, if any, which will be materially affected by any of the changes proposed in said application, which shall include all properties located within the area of influence of the property which is the subject of the application, as defined in the review guidelines adopted by the historic district commission. The commission shall forthwith send by mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant and to the owners of all such affected properties, a notice of hearing to be held by the commission on said application. Notices of the public hearing shall be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the hearing, and a notice of such hearing shall be published at least one time in a newspaper having circulation throughout the city at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. The cost of such notices shall be paid by the applicant. The commission shall conduct a hearing on an application within thirty (30) days of the date of application, assuming all notice requirements have been complied with. In the event the applicant obtains a written waiver of notice from owners of properties within the area of influence, no publication or mailing of notice of hearing shall be required.

 (b) At the public hearing, the commission shall hear all persons desiring to present information regarding the application. After such public hearing, the historic district commission shall make its determination as to the appropriateness of the proposed change. The commission may immediately announce its decision or defer the matter to its next regularly scheduled commission meeting or reschedule the application for further consideration at such other public hearings as are deemed necessary or desirable in order to fully develop the facts and circumstances surrounding any one particular application. No application for a certificate of appropriateness for a purpose other than demolition shall be deferred at the instance of the historic district commission longer than thirty (30) days from the date of the first public hearing without consent of the applicant. Further, if the commission has rendered no decision on the application for a purpose other than demolition within thirty (30) days from the time of the first public hearing, unless the applicant has agreed to a further deferral or extension of time, the commission shall consider the application as having been approved and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
 
 (c) If the application for a certificate of appropriateness involves the demolition of a building which the commission initially determines to be an inappropriate demolition, then notwithstanding said determination, the commission may defer the matter until such time as the commission has had an opportunity to consider the following alternatives to the demolition of subject property: 
 
(1) Sources of funding for preservation and restoration activities, if lack of such funds is the reason for the request to demolish. 
 
(2) Adaptive use changes, if there are conditions under which the required preservation of a historic landmark should cause undue hardship to the owner or owners, so long as such changes are in keeping with the spirit and intent of this article. 
 
(3) An attempt to find a purchaser for the property who would maintain the landmark in a suitable and acceptable manner within the limits of the historic district commission ordinance (this article). 
 
(4) Any such other solution as may be deemed advisable and in keeping with the spirit and intent of this article. 
 
 During the time the commission is considering any one of the alternatives hereinabove set out, progress reports shall be made by the commission and/or its staff at each regularly scheduled commission meeting. If, at the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of the first public hearing of an application for demolition, the commission has not found a viable alternative to the demolition of the property, the commission shall reschedule the matter for public hearing requiring notices as aforesaid, and upon said public hearing, make its final determination as to the application. In such cases, the public hearing for final determination shall be held within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the sixty (60) days from the date of the first public hearing, and at the second public hearing, the commission may hear such matters as are considered necessary or desirable to fully advise the commission of all facts and 
 
 
 
Title 16 . Page 195  Supplement No. 33 
16-7-12 HOT SPRINGS CODE 16-7-13 
 HISTORIC DISTRICTS 
 
 
circumstances as then exist as they pertain to the proposed demolition.  At the second public hearing the commission shall immediately announce its decision. If the commission has rendered no decision on the application for demolition within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the sixty (60) days following the first public hearing, the commission shall consider the application as having been approved and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. 
 
 (d) In addition to considering the matters brought to the commission's attention and the criteria hereinabove set out in section 16-7-11, the commission may determine that failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness will involve a substantial hardship to the applicant, and notwithstanding that it may be inappropriate, owing to conditions especially affecting the structure but not affecting the historic district generally, such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the intent and purpose of this division, and the commission may approve such application and grant a certificate of appropriateness for the activity proposed. 
 
 (e) The commission may seek technical advice from outside its members on any application. The secretary of the commission shall, upon request, furnish a copy of any written consultant's opinion to the applicant. 
 
 (f) If the commission determines that a certificate of appropriateness should not be issued, it shall place upon its record the reasons for such determination and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition. 
 
 (g) No person shall be granted a building permit, demolition permit or other construction permit by the city for new construction, or alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of the exterior facade of any structure located within the historic district until all requirements of this article have been complied with. 
 
 (h) The commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use of a building and shall take no action with regard to interior arrangement or use. (Ord. No. 3944, § 5, 3-21-88; Ord. No. 4242, § 1,7-20-92) 
 
 (i) No application for a certificate of appropriateness which has been denied wholly or partly by the historic district commission shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of said denial, except upon a showing of a substantial change in conditions found to be valid by the historic district commission and demonstrated by a majority vote of the full historic district commission.  If the commission decides to rehear a case it shall require legal notification as required for a new application. For purposes hereof, a change of ownership of the subject property shall not be deemed to be a change of conditions. (Ord. No. 5678, §1, 9-16-08) 
 
16-7-13. Exceptions. 
 Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, unless the architectural element or sign to be repaired or replaced does not comply with existing guidelines promulgated by the commission;

nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the Hot Springs board of directors or other agent of the city shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition; nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any such feature under a permit issued by the city engineer or similar agent of the city prior to the effective date of the establishment of said historic district. Any permit issued prior to the effective date of the establishment of said historic district for demolition of a structure within the boundaries of the district may be renewed without review by the commission for a period up to three (3) years after the effective date. (Ord. No. 3944, § 6, 3-21-88) 
 
16-7-14. Appeal. 
 
 Any applicant aggrieved by the determination of the commission may, within thirty (30) days after the making of such decision, appeal the determination of the commission to the chancery court of Garland County. The court shall hear all pertinent evidence and shall annul the determination of the commission if it finds the reasons given for such determinations to be unsupported by the evidence or to be insufficient in law, and may make such other decree as justice and equity may require. The remedy provided by this section shall be exclusive, but the applicant shall have all rights of appeal as in other equity cases. (Ord. No. 3944, § 7, 3-21-88)

16-9-7  Tree and shrub preservation. 
 
 A major objective of the Code is to encourage the preservation of existing vegetation wherever possible while allowing quality development to take place.  Preserved trees and shrubs, therefore, are given higher values toward landscape requirements than introduced trees and shrubs.  To qualify for landscape, buffer and screening requirements, the following measures shall be required for preserved trees and shrubs: 
 
(a) Protective fencing or other construction barrier shall be placed at and completely encompass the root protection zone of all preserved plants prior to site preparation and construction.  Protective measures shall remain in place and maintained until completion of development.   


 
(b) Any tree whose root protection zone will be affected by soil removal shall have roots cleanly and properly pruned at a point at least 1’ outside the construction barrier installed as required above.
