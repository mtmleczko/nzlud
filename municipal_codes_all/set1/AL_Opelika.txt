PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Opelika, Alabama, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the City's 1964 Code, as supplemented through December 2, 1980 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 15 and 16 it will be designated as Chapter 15.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Editor's note- It should be noted that pursuant to Act.

Sec. 2-71. - Disciplinary action and appeal procedure. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish a due process procedure for disciplinary actions. In addition to the City of Opelika's Personal Grievance Procedures, police officers shall be entitled to a hearing before an internal disciplinary review board. This section addresses the due process requirements relating to all disciplinary proceedings. In the event an officer is charged with a rule violation, the following policies will be observed by all supervisors. If disciplinary actions cannot be resolved informally, an aggrieved officer should follow the appeal process set out below. 
(A)  Disciplinary Action: When a supervisor recommends disciplinary action against an officer of the police department, the incident will be recorded on an appropriate work incident form. The officer will be asked to sign a work incident report indicating that he is aware of the report and the charges contained therein. By signing the report, the officer neither agrees nor disagrees with the substance of the report. Should any officer refuse to sign, a witness (other than the supervisor) should sign to the effect that the refusing officer did see the report. An officer is not required to acknowledge in writing the receipt of an oral reprimand by a supervisor. 
    A corporal, sergeant, lieutenant or captain of police may discipline subordinate personnel for any one violation of an order or departmental policy, rule and regulation, or procedure by oral reprimand (must be documented), written formal warning, or by temporary suspension from duty in accordance with Section 2-69(E). 
    Whenever a supervisor recommends disciplinary action, a work incident report will be forwarded immediately through the chain of command to the division commander for his information and recommendations or concurrence on the proposed disciplinary action. The division commander will forward the work incident report to the assistant chief who will review the report and recommendations and take the appropriate disciplinary action. Upon receipt of a work incident report, the assistant chief will immediately notify the chief of police of the incident and the recommendations of the supervisors. 
    The assistant chief will be responsible for conducting a due process hearing for the officer and taking the appropriate disciplinary action. The due process hearing will be conducted in the same manner and in conformity with the same procedures as provided in Section 2-45(VI) for a determination hearing. The assistant chief will ensure that all disciplinary forms are completed, signed and forwarded to the chief of police. If the officer disagrees with the disciplinary action, he/she shall have the right to appeal to a disciplinary review board as provided herein. The assistant chief shall ensure that the officer is notified of his right of appeal. 
(B)  Composition of Disciplinary Review Board: The disciplinary review board will be composed of three (3) members: one (1) member to be appointed by the chief of police; one (1) member appointed by the aggrieved officer; and the third member, who will be the board chairman, to be selected by the two (2) appointed members. The board members shall be sworn police officers of any rank selected from any assignment within the department. 
(C)  Request for Hearing: The board shall be convened by direction of the chief of police after receipt of a written request by the officer for a hearing by the disciplinary review board. The aggrieved officer shall make his/her request for a hearing in writing through his/her division commander to the chief of police no later than five (5) days following the notification by the assistant chief of his decision to impose disciplinary action. In the event the officer fails to request a hearing within five (5) days, the decision to impose disciplinary action will be considered final and the officer will be deemed to have accepted such action. Upon a timely request for a hearing, the chief of police shall, within five (5) days of the receipt of said request, direct a disciplinary review board to be formed in the manner as prescribed in this section. 
(D)  Procedures for Hearings: The disciplinary review board shall hold a hearing within four (4) days of notification by the chief of police of the formation of the board. The assistant chief will give a copy of the original work incident form to the board. 
    Once formed, the disciplinary review board will meet and hear the officer's appeal. In the event the aggrieved officer fails to appear at said hearing, the appeal will be dismissed and the officer shall be deemed to have waived any objections to the imposition of the original disciplinary action. At the request of the officer and for good cause shown, the chief of police may continue and reset any scheduled hearing of the disciplinary review board. 
    The officer shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard in person or by his representative or attorney at the hearing. After the hearing, the disciplinary review board shall issue a written nonbinding recommendation to the chief of police. The board, in its discretion, may recommend to the chief of police that disciplinary action be affirmed or set aside, or that the type or severity of the disciplinary action be modified. Upon receipt and review of the recommendation of the board, the chief of police shall issue his decision in writing regarding the type of disciplinary action, if any, to be taken against the officer. The officer shall have the right to appeal from an adverse decision to a grievance committee as provided in Section 2-46(III)(D). 
    All documents, reports and papers relating to the facts, circumstances, hearings, recommendations and decisions relating to the aggrieved officer shall be placed in his/her departmental personnel file. Copies of all documents shall be furnished to the officer upon request. 
(E)  Termination or Suspension of Employees: An employee who is discharged or suspended without pay for more than five (5) days shall be entitled to a hearing before a grievance committee as provided in Section 2-46(III)(D).

If a bidder or contractor who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-responsible, a written determination of non-responsibility setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The failure of a bidder or contractor to supply prompt information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds of a determination of non-responsibility with respect to such bidder or contractor. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the non-responsible bidder or contractor. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made a public record. 
(l)  Promulgation of rules and regulations. The purchasing agent, subject to the direction of the mayor, is authorized to promulgate rules, regulations and policies in furtherance of the provisions of this article.

(5)  Further action is taken by the city council as provided by subsection (f). 
(f)  If for any reason an ordered repair, move, or demolition cannot be accomplished within one hundred eighty (180) days of the passage of the resolution ordering the same, the building official shall make a report of the same and the length of any desired extension to the city council. The city clerk shall distribute a copy of the report to the members of the city council.

Following the public hearing, the city council may adopt a resolution extending the time for the repair, move, or demolition to be accomplished for such period of time as it deems necessary. The city council need not order an extension before the time to complete the repair, move, or demolition expires in order for the extension to be effective, but if the city council desires to extend the time to complete the repair, move, or demolition, then the city council must order the extension no more than sixty (60) days after the expiration of the then existing deadline to complete the repair, move, or demolition.

The city reserves the right to deny an application for a wireless facility permit if the city determines that the proposed site or group of sites, based on the particular facts and circumstances, is substantially adverse to the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants, or will have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. In the event a location proposed by applicant is unacceptable, the city will work in good faith with the applicant to identify one or more suitable alternate locations. 
(4)  Setback. Wireless facilities shall be installed with a minimum twenty (20) foot setback from buildings, the minimum separation required by NESC or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. An applicant may request a waiver of this requirement in the event a building is located immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way, and no reasonable alternative siting locations are available. 
(5)  New additional poles. 
a.  No new additional poles will be permitted unless an applicant submits written documentation demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city that applicant has undertaken reasonable efforts to collocate the proposed wireless facility upon an existing support structure, and that (i) no suitable support structure exists, or (ii) such efforts have been unsuccessful. 
b.  New additional poles approved under this article shall be installed with a minimum twenty (20) foot setback from buildings, the minimum separation required by NESC, or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. 
(6)  Aesthetic standards. Wireless facilities shall comply with the aesthetic standards set forth in this subsection. In the event an applicant seeks to place a wireless facility that does not comply with these standards, it must request and be granted a waiver as set forth in this article. 
a.  General aesthetic requirements. 
1.  The placement and design of wireless facilities shall be consistent with existing structures and aesthetics, in harmony with the surroundings, and as unobtrusive as reasonably possible. 
2.  To minimize the visual impact, all pole-mounted equipment shall be installed as close to the pole as technically feasible, and shall be painted flat and non-reflective colors that match the underlying pole (unless such requirement is specifically waived by the city). 
3.  Screening and equipment enclosures shall blend with the surrounding environmental and structural context in terms of scale, form, texture, materials and color. Equipment shall be concealed as much as reasonably possible by blending into the natural and/or physical environment. 
4.  Collocations between limited numbers of multiple separate wireless service providers on the same support structure are encouraged wherever feasible. If an applicant seeking to place a new wireless facility proposes to not collocate when reasonable options appear available, demonstrative proof must be provided as to why collocation is not feasible. 
5.  In the historic downtown area, small wireless facilities collocated upon existing decorative light poles shall be consistent with the existing decorative light poles. Applicant shall propose a design that uses concealment effects, that is comparable in scale, and that incorporates the design characteristics of those poles. Wireless facilities in the historic downtown area shall use coloring to match surrounding light poles and fixtures. 
6.  If a new standalone pole or cabinet for a wireless facility is to be installed within one hundred (100) feet of any decorative pole, the color of the new pole and cabinet should match the color of the decorative pole. Otherwise, such new poles and cabinets should be black in color, using Gloss Black #17038 per Federal Color Standard 595. 
7.  In residential areas in which utilities are placed underground and decorative light poles are used, any new pole proposed by applicant shall substantially match existing decorative poles in terms of material, color and design. 
8.  New standalone poles shall be constructed of aluminum or steel. 
9.  All cabling for a wireless facility upon a new pole must traverse the interior of the pole. Otherwise, cable traversing the pole shall be covered using a U-guard of steel or aluminum construction no less than two (2) inches in diameter. No cables shall be visible on the exterior of a city light pole. 
10.  Wireless facilities shall be installed with a minimum spacing of three hundred (300) feet between wireless facilities of a single applicant in commercial areas, or six hundred (600) feet in residential areas. 
11.  Wireless facilities should use tapered shapes that smoothly integrate into structures (avoiding, for example, new rectangular boxes). 
12.  No wireless facilities shall be installed within a public park or in a public right-of-way within two hundred fifty (250) feet of a park. 
b.  Antennas. 
1.  The total volume of antennas must not exceed three (3) cubic feet on a single pole. 
2.  Antennas must be no taller than four (4) feet. 
3.  Antennas must have a smooth cylindrical shape, such as a single canister, or multiple separate antennas placed inside sheeting that is flush with the pole, or a form factor in which multiple antennas merge into a single smooth shape. No separately mounted antennas will be allowed on a single installation (for example, multiple-sector panel antennas). 
4.  Antennas must be flush-mounted or placed in line with the pole. 
c.  Cabinets. 
1.  Pole-mounted cabinets. 
(i)  Pole-mounted cabinets should not be used on a light pole if a technical and commercially reasonable alternative is available. Equipment should be placed inside the pole, such as in the base of the pole, in a way that integrates with the design of the pole. 
(ii)  Cabinets may be permitted on the sidewalk side of light poles except in the historic downtown area. 
(iii)  Cabinets may be permitted on the sidewalk side of wooden utility poles. 
(iv)  Outside the historic downtown area, cabinets may either be mounted on a pole or on a concrete slab within fifty (50) feet of the pole where the antenna is mounted. 
(v)  Pole-mounted cabinets must have at least an eight (8) foot clearance from the ground, or the minimum clearance required by the NESC, whichever is greater. 
(vi)  Pole-mounted cabinets must be flush-mounted to poles. 
(vii)  Rectangular cabinets on poles shall be limited to forty-eight (48) inches (height) by twenty-four (24) inches (width) by eighteen (18) inches (depth); cabinets that are non-rectangular in shape must be comparable or less in volume and visual impact. 
(viii)  Pole-mounted equipment should be placed within enclosures with tapered shapes, which are less obtrusive than rectangular cabinets. 
(ix)  The power meter and power disconnect switch must be located below the cabinet or (in the case of a light pole) inside the pole. 
(x)  Cabinets on light poles must be same color as the pole. Cabinets on wooden utility poles must be a neutral, unobtrusive color (e.g., black, brown, dark green). 
2.  Surface-mounted cabinets. 
(i)  Surface-mounted cabinets must be on a concrete slab, and where possible must be in close proximity to existing pedestals and cabinets (for example, near traffic signal controllers, transformers or other utility pedestals). 
(ii)  Surface-mounted cabinets must be the same color as other nearby pedestals or cabinets. Where there are no other nearby pedestals or cabinets, the cabinets should be the same color as the pole housing the antenna. 
(iii)  Surface-mounted cabinets must be no larger than ten (10) cubic feet in volume, and with height, width, and depth each not exceeding three and one-half (31/2) feet. 
d.  Attachments to buildings. To preserve and protect the nature and character of the area, any attachment of an antenna to a building shall be upon the face of the structure without increasing the height of the building, unless the applicant demonstrates that such restriction will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service. Any cabling shall match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building. If antennas are required to be mounted above the roof-line of any building, the applicant must comply with a plan to camouflage the antennas. 
e.  Lighting and noise. 
1.  No lighting is allowed on small wireless facilities. If there are lights on the supplied equipment, they must be covered, removed, or deactivated. 
2.  Wireless attachments may not create noise greater than fifty (50) dB measured at twenty (20) feet from the device in residential neighborhoods. 
(7)  Replacement of poles. 
a.  Use of a city-owned pole to collocate a wireless facility may require replacement with a new pole designed to accommodate the wireless facility, as described in section 5.5-411. In the event the applicant believes the existing pole can support the structure and fulfill all other aesthetic and technical standards, the applicant shall provide an industry-standard pole load analysis certified by an Alabama professional engineer indicating that the specific pole will safely support the load. 
b.  A city-owned pole that is replaced with a new pole must be replaced with a new pole at the same location that is designed primarily to serve the purpose of the original pole (such as illumination) while also serving as a support structure for the wireless attachment. Any such replacement pole shall be substantially identical to the specific type pole that it replaces, notwithstanding modifications that may be necessary to build equipment into the interior or base, or other departures from the original design that may be required by the city. 
c.  Replacement poles shall be constructed of the same material as the pole replaced, unless otherwise permitted or required by the city. 
d.  The applicant shall minimize any design differences between a replacement structure and the original pole or structure. 
(8)  Use of wooden utility poles. 
a.  Wireless facilities may not be installed on wooden utility poles with existing transformers, switches, or risers. 
b.  The order of preference in use of wooden utility poles is as follows: 
1.  Stub poles. 
2.  Poles without primary power. 
3.  Poles with primary power, extended with a pole top prior to installing any wireless attachments. 
c.  Cables must be bonded, grounded, and placed inside a riser on the pole. Risers must be the same color as the pole and mounted on the back side of the pole. 
(9)  Undergrounding provisions. Applicant shall comply with city ordinance requirements concerning undergrounding of service lines and related equipment which can be feasibly installed underground for utility and telecommunications facilities, which shall be applied on a non-discriminatory basis, provided that such requirements shall not prohibit the replacement of allowed existing structures with similar structures. Nor shall such requirements prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of wireless services in the areas subject to undergrounding requirements.

When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing it to immediately cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements of this article or any other ordinance; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including the immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when is has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this article. The person responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city within five (5) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
14.5.2  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
14.5.3  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. 
An offense is also committed if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the city. 
14.6  Civil penalties. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten (10) days, or such greater period as the city shall deem appropriate, after the city has taken one or more of the actions described above, the city may impose a penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) (depending upon the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
14.7  Criminal prosecutions. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this article shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per violation per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 117-11, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-15. - Appeal of notice of violation. 
    Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the city. The notice of appeal must be received in writing within ten (10) days from the date of the notice of violation. A hearing on the appeal before the appropriate municipal authority or his/her designee shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority or their designee shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 117-11, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-16. - Enforcement measures after appeal. 
    If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten (10) days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the city, then representatives of the city shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of the premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(Ord. No. 117-11, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-17. - Cost of abatement of the violation. 
    Within ten (10) days after the abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten (10) days of being notified of the abatement cost. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
    Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than five (5) equal monthly payments. Interest at the rate of five (5) percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the tenth day following the discovery of the violation. 
(Ord. No. 117-11, § 1, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 7-18. - Violations deemed a public nuisance. 
    In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 7-21. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Opelika, Alabama, does ordain these flood damage prevention and protection regulations. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-22. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Opelika, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-23. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands, and; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-24. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17)

Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. 
(10)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance shall be maintained in the office of the building official and shall be open for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 7-37. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
i  Provide a minimum of two (2)openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and, 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and, 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if the non- conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-38. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 7-37(4), "Elevated buildings." 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in division 3, section 7-36(6). 
    The design professional for structures located in these zones shall submit a flood emergency operation plan, an inspection and maintenance plan, with the requirement that these plans are to include yearly training drills to be coordinated with the office of the building official. 
    Change of ownership notification requirements. 
    The owner of every flood-proofed building is responsible for providing written disclosure to the prospective buyer that the building requires periodic inspection and maintenance activities as described in the inspection and maintenance plan and the new property owner will be responsible for regulatory compliance. In addition, the property owner will require that the subsequent property owner make and require the same disclosure to and for all potential future successors, and the covenant described below will be recorded on the record of title for the site. 
    A deed restriction for the site of the flood-proofed building will be recorded in the form of a covenant and agreement (covenant) made by and between the City of Opelika and the property owner. The covenant shall set forth the inspection and maintenance activities for the flood-proofed building as described in the inspection and maintenance plan. Any lease agreement between the property owner and a tenant shall also contain clear language stating the leaseholder's responsibilities for the flood-proofed building. 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
ii.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer: division 4, section 7-37) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
i.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
ii.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of division 4 section 7-38 (3)(a)(c), above. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-39. - Floodways. 
(1)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 7-26, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; 
b.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
c.  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
d.  Only if division 4 section 7-39(1)(b), or (c), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-40. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (Approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 7-26, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (Approximate A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with division 2 section 7-26 then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2 and 4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in Zone A must meet the requirements of division 4, section 7-37, section 7-38(1) through (3), and section 7-42. 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of division 4, section 7-38, paragraph (3)(b)(ii) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (5 feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 7-37 (4) "Elevated buildings". 
    The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 131-17, § 1, 12-5-17) 
Sec. 7-41. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 7-26, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet (1'-3') above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:

(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the construction board of adjustments and appeals may appeal such decision to the Lee County Circuit Court, as provided in Code of Alabama. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the construction board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the construction board of adjustments and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §44, Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Secs. 7-45-7-79. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL[4] 
Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 108-17, § 1, adopted April 4, 2017, repealed the former Art. III, §§ 7-80-7-91, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 116-02, § 1, 6-18-02. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 7-80. - Introduction and purpose. 
    During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
    As required by the city's phase II municipal separate storm sewer (MS4) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), the city must develop, implement, and enforce a stormwater management program designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from its MS4 to the "maximum extent practicable," to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA). This article is therefore enacted to preserve, protect, and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city, through the reduction, control, and prevention of the discharge of pollutants from newly developed and redeveloped sites to the MS4. It is the expressed intent of the city in enacting this article to provide for and promote compliance by the city with federal and state laws governing the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 and to provide for and promote compliance with the city's NPDES permit, issued by ADEM pursuant to its authority under the CWA. Additionally, this policy reinforces the need for those sites less than one (1) acre in size to be classified as "permit by rule" construction sites required to implement and maintain best management practices until land disturbing activities have ceased and permanent stabilization has been achieved.

    Non-point source: Is considered discharge resulting from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage or hydrologic modification. Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, comes from many diffuse sources. NPS pollution is caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters and ground waters.

    Permittee: A person, party, government entity and all others who receive a permit to discharge under the NPDES. 
    Point sources: of water pollution are described by the CWA as "any discernible, confined, and conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged." These include pipes or man-made ditches from stationary locations such as sewage treatment plants, factories, industrial wastewater treatment facilities, septic systems, ships, and other sources that are clearly discharging pollutants into water sources. 
    Pollutant: Includes but is not limited to, the pollutants specified in Section 22-22-1(b) (3) of the AWPCA and any other effluent characteristics specified in a permit. 
    Pollutant loading: The amount of a pollutant entering the MS4 stormwater system. See TMDLs. 
    Post-construction strategies: BMPs and other measures for activities that take place after construction occurs, including structural and non-structural controls to obtain permanent stormwater management over the life of the property's use. Requires annual inspections. 
    PSC: Alabama Public Service Commission. The state's regulatory agency created under Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 37-1-1, et seq., responsible for the regulation of utilities including but not limited to those providing electricity, gas, water, and steam.

(b)  All discharges not explicitly authorized by this article are prohibited. Any discharge to the MS4 made in violation of this article or of any condition of a permit issued pursuant to this article shall be subject to correction and/or abatement in accordance with applicable law. 
(c)  The state's phase II MS4 NPDES permit allows the authority to rely upon ADEM for the enforcement of certain violations of this article. The authority hereby expresses its intent to rely upon ADEM for enforcement of violations of this article, as allowed [in] the state's phase II MS4 NPDES if and only if the enforcement by the authority becomes futile and a not effective method of resolving a violation of the current ordinances, and thus agrees to promptly notify ADEM upon observing evidence of any known or suspected violations. Furthermore, no enforcement action will be taken by the authority for a violation of the terms of this article if any of the following has occurred: 
(1)  ADEM has issued a notice of violation with respect to the same alleged violation and is proceeding with an enforcement action with respect to such alleged violation; 
(2)  ADEM has issued an administrative order with respect to the same alleged violation and is proceeding with an enforcement action with respect to such violation; or 
(3)  ADEM has commenced, and is proceeding with, an enforcement action, or has completed any other type of administrative or civil action, with respect to such alleged violation. 
Any determination or resolution made by ADEM with respect to an alleged violation shall be final, and the alleged violation will not be made the subject of any additional enforcement action by the authority for any alleged violations of this article and/or provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this article. However, for violations that have not been appropriately corrected and/or abated pursuant to ADEM's enforcement action, an enforcement action may be pursued by the authority. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this article to the contrary, in the event of an immediate threat to the public health or welfare, the authority may take all appropriate measures to remove or alleviate such threat. 
(e)  In the event of any accidental discharge of a hazardous substance or a significant spill of a hazardous substance to the MS4 which could constitute a threat to human health or the environment, the permittee of the site shall give notice to the authority and the local emergency management authority in the same manner and within the same time as is required by state regulations for notice to ADEM. 
Absent a compelling public interest to the contrary, it shall not be a defense for the permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the business or activity of the site, or any project or facility thereon, to maintain water quality and minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 109-17, § 1, adopted April 4, 2017, repealed the former Art. IV, §§ 7-101-7-115, and enacted a new Art. IV as set out herein. The former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 107-14, § 1, 3-18-14. 

Sec. 7-101. - Purpose. 
    Post-construction stormwater management refers to the activities that take place after construction occurs, and includes structural and non-structural controls including low-impact development and green infrastructure practices to obtain permanent stormwater management over the life of the property's use. 
    As required by the city's phase II municipal separate storm sewer (MS4) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), the city must develop, implement, and enforce a post-construction stormwater management program designed to reduce the discharge of pollutants from its MS4 to the "maximum extent practicable," to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA). This article is therefore enacted to preserve, protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, through the reduction, control and prevention and operation and maintenance of structures for the management and the discharge of water with potential pollutants from newly developed and redeveloped sites to the MS4. It is the expressed intent of the city in enacting this article to provide for and promote compliance by the city with federal and state laws governing the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 and to provide for and promote compliance with the city's NPDES permit, issued by ADEM pursuant to its authority under the CWA.

(c)  The state's phase II MS4 NPDES permit allows the authority to rely upon ADEM for the enforcement of certain violations of this article. The authority hereby expresses its intent to rely upon ADEM for enforcement of violations of this article, as allowed [in] the state's phase II MS4 NPDES if and only if the enforcement by the authority becomes futile and a not effective method of resolving a violation of the current ordinances, and thus agrees to promptly notify ADEM upon observing evidence of any known or suspected violations. Furthermore, no enforcement action will be taken by the authority for a violation of the terms of this article if any of the following has occurred: 
(1)  ADEM has issued a notice of violation with respect to the same alleged violation and is proceeding with an enforcement action with respect to such alleged violation; 
(2)  ADEM has issued an administrative order with respect to the same alleged violation and is proceeding with an enforcement action with respect to such violation; or 
(3)  ADEM has commenced, and is proceeding with, an enforcement action, or has completed any other type of administrative or civil action, with respect to such alleged violation. 
Any determination or resolution made by ADEM with respect to an alleged violation shall be final, and the alleged violation will not be made the subject of any additional enforcement action by the authority for any alleged violations of this article and/or provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this article. However, for violations that have not been appropriately corrected and/or abated pursuant to ADEM's enforcement action, an enforcement action may be pursued by the authority. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this article to the contrary, in the event of an immediate threat to the public health or welfare, the authority may take all appropriate measures to remove or alleviate such threat. 
(e)  In the event of any accidental discharge of a hazardous substance or a significant spill of a hazardous substance to the MS4 which could constitute a threat to human health or the environment, the permittee of the site shall give notice to the authority and the local emergency management authority in the same manner and within the same time as is required by state regulations for notice to ADEM. 
Absent a compelling public interest to the contrary, it shall not be a defense for the permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the business or activity of the site, or any project or facility thereon, to maintain water quality and minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause. 
(f)  Whenever the authority finds that any person is in violation of any provision of this article and fails to take corrective action within the specified time, the authority may proceed with the following enforcement action: 
(1)  Stop-work order; revocation of local approvals. No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair, or maintain any grading, excavation, or fill, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any terms of this policy. In the event that any person holding a permit or approval pursuant to this policy violates the terms of the permit or implements site development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health, welfare, environment, or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the authority may suspend or revoke the said approval. 
(2)  Compliance order. When the authority finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, this article, it may issue a compliance order to the violator, directing that, within a specified time period, adequate structures and devices be installed, or procedures implemented, and properly operated, or other action be taken, to remedy such violation. Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as may be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address such violation, including the construction of appropriate structures, installation of devices and self-monitoring and management practices. 
(3)  Cease and desist orders. When the authority finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, this article or any order issued under this article in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health, welfare, environment, or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or development site so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood; the authority may issue an order to such person to cease and desist all land disturbance activities immediately, and direct such person in violation of this article to: 
a.  Comply with this article forthwith; or 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be required to address properly a continuing or threatened violation of this article. 
(g)  It shall be unlawful for any person to: 
(1)  Violate any provision of this article; 
(2)  Violate the provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this article; or 
(3)  Fail or refuse to comply with any lawful notice to abate or take corrective action issued by the authority. 
Such person shall be guilty of a criminal offense; and each day of such violation, failure or refusal to comply with this article shall be deemed a separate offense and punishable accordingly. Any person found to be in violation of any of the provisions of this article may be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or up to one hundred eighty (180) days in jail. 
(h)  The authority may initiate proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction against any person who has, or who, the authority has reason to believe, is about to: 
(1)  Violate any provision of this article; 
(2)  Violate any provision of a permit; or 
(3)  Fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order issued by the authority. 
The authority may also initiate civil proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction seeking monetary damages for any damages caused to public stormwater facilities by any person, and may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce compliance with the provisions of this article or to force compliance with any lawful orders of the authority.

The applicant shall prepare a written request for a variance stating the specific variance sought and the reasons, with supporting data, for granting such variance. This request shall include descriptions, drawings, calculations, and any other information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance. The authority will review the submitted material and make a written determination to approve or disapprove the variance within ten (10) working days after receipt of such a request. There shall be no appeal process for the variance request. The authority is the final arbiter of the variance request. 
(Ord. No. 109-17, § 1, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 7-109. - Liability. 
    Neither the issuance of a permit pursuant to this article, nor compliance with the provisions of this article, shall relieve any person of the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law. 
    Nothing herein shall be construed to require the city or its officials, employees, agents or attorneys to restore or cause the restoration of property damaged by erosion or sedimentation in violation of this article or to otherwise seek or assist others in seeking compensation to private property owners for any such damage caused by a violation of this article. The city and its officials, employees, agents and attorneys shall not be liable for any condition or damages that result from any failure to observe or recognize a hazardous condition, any failure of an approved plan to prevent erosion or sedimentation, or any failure of the city to cause owners and builders to adhere to the terms of this article. Nothing herein shall be construed to expand the liability of the city or its officials, employees, agents or attorneys nor shall it create any additional, further, different or expanded claim or cause of action. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the authority to enforce rules and regulations regarding: 
(1)  Charges, limits and restrictions on the discharge of waste into the sanitary sewerage system of the city; 
(2)  Health or sanitation ordinances of the city enforced by the county health department; or 
(3)  Ordinances governing the sanitation of premises where animals are kept.

It shall be unlawful for any person to provide false information to the authority when such person knows or has reason to know that the information provided is false, whether such information is required by this article or any approval granted under this article.

(Ord. No. 105-17, § 1, 2-21-17) 
Sec. 9.5-2. - Purpose. 
    The general purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of Opelika by requiring that new and existing mobile food vehicles and pushcart vendors provide residents and customers with a level of cleanliness, quality and safety.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 103-06, § 1, adopted Feb. 21, 2006, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 11-100-11-117. To preserve the style of this Code and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 11-31-11-48. 

Sec. 11-31. - Title 
    This article shall be known as the City of Opelika Smokefree Air Ordinance of 2006. 
(Ord. No. 103-06, § 1(11-100), 2-21-06) 
Sec. 11-32. - Findings and intent. 
    The city does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (Nd), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NC), August 1999.) 
(2)  The public health service's national toxicology program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
(3)  A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smokefree workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) 
(4)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
(5)  The Americans with Disabilities Act, which 'requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
(6)  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not: eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
(7)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is non-linear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one or two (2) cigarettes a day, and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal 328:980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
(8)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as 'well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(9)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(10)  Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree. Creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A. & Smith, L. The effect of ordinances requiring smokefree restaurants on restaurant sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 37:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, CM., "The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
(11)  Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to businesses. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(12)  The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a positive danger to health, and a material public nuisance. 
(13)  Electronic smoking devices, commonly known as "electronic cigarettes", "e-cigarettes", "e-cigars", "e-cigarillos", "e-pipes", "e-hookahs", "electronic nicotine delivery systems", etc., are electric or battery operated devices designed to deliver nicotine, flavor and/or other substances through a vapor inhaled by the user. 
(14)  The use of electronic smoking devices has increased significantly in recent years. 
(15)  More than one study has concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or second-hand vaping. 
(16)  Some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be re-filled with liquid nicotine solution, creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine. 
(17)  Electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape, size and color with the user exhaling smoke-like vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products. 
(18)  The use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made. 
    Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this section are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

However, if the department fails to substantially comply with the provisions of this section, the revenue officer shall, upon application by the taxpayer or other good cause shown, abate any penalties otherwise arising from the examination or assessment. 
(d)  Abatement of penalty. The department shall abate any penalty attributable to erroneous written advice furnished to a taxpayer by an employee of the department; provided, however, that this section shall apply only if the department employee provided the written advice in good faith while acting in his official capacity, the written advice was reasonably relied on by the taxpayer and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer, and the penalty did not result from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information.

(b)  Procedures governing entry of preliminary and final assessments; appeals therefrom . 
(1)  Entry of preliminary assessment; final assessment of uncontested 
tax; execution of preliminary and final assessments. 
a.  If the department determines that the amount of any tax or license fee as reported on a return is incorrect, or if no return is filed, or if the department is required to determine value, the department is authorized to calculate the correct tax or value based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable by the department. The department may thereafter enter a preliminary assessment for the correct tax or value, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
b.  Where the amount of tax or value reported on a return is undisputed by the department or the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency, determination of value, or preliminary assessment in writing as provided by regulation, the department may immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of such tax or value, plus applicable penalty and interest; provided, however, that the department may at any time enter a final jeopardy assessment in the manner provided in subsection (b)(6) of this section. 
c.  All preliminary and final assessments issued by the department shall be executed as provided by regulations promulgated by the department. 
(2)  Time limitation for entering preliminary assessment. Any preliminary assessment must be entered within three (3) years from the due date of the return, or three (3) years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later, or if no return is required to be filed, within three (3) years of the due date of the tax except as follows: 
a.  A preliminary assessment may be entered at any time if no return is filed as required, or if a false or fraudulent return is filed with the intent to evade tax. 
b.  A preliminary assessment may be entered within six (6) years from the due date of the return or six (6) years from the date the return is filed with the department, whichever is later, if such return omits more than twenty-five (25) percent of the correct amount of tax required to be shown on such return. 
c.  A preliminary assessment entered pursuant to Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-2A-72 or Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-29-73 may be entered within five (5) years from the due date of the return on which the underlying tax is required to be reported or within five (5) years of the date such return is filed, whichever is later. 
d.  The running of the period of limitations provided in this section for entering a preliminary assessment shall be suspended for the period that: 
1.  The taxpayer or the assets of the taxpayer are involved in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code (bankruptcy), and for a period of six (6) months thereafter; or 
2.  The assets of the taxpayer are in the control or custody of a court in any proceeding, and for a period of six (6) months thereafter. 
e.  The department and the taxpayer may, prior to the expiration of the period for entering a preliminary assessment or the filing of a petition for refund, agree in writing to extend the time provided for such in this article. Such tax may be assessed, or such petition for refund may be filed, at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
f.  Additional tax may be assessed by the department within any applicable period allowed in this section, notwithstanding that a preliminary or final assessment has been previously entered by the department against the same taxpayer for the same or a portion of the same tax period; provided, however, that no taxpayer shall be subject to unnecessary examination or investigation, and only one inspection of a taxpayer's books and records relating to each type of tax administered by the department shall be made for each taxable year, unless the taxpayer requests otherwise or unless the revenue officer after investigation, notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary. 
(3)  Service of preliminary assessment upon taxpayer. The preliminary assessment entered by the department, or a copy thereof, shall be promptly mailed by the department to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class United States mail or certified mail with return receipt requested; provided, however, that at the option of the department, the preliminary assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(4)  Procedure for review of disputed preliminary assessments; entry and notice of final assessment. 
a.  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the department, the taxpayer may file a written petition for review with the department within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. If a petition for review is timely filed, or if the department otherwise deems it necessary, the department shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer and the department to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors, and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to their respective positions. 
b.  If a written petition for review is not timely filed, or is properly filed, and upon further review the department determines the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the department may make the assessment final in the amount of tax due as computed by the department, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. 
c.  The final assessment entered by the department, or a copy thereof, shall be mailed by the department to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class United States mail or certified mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of tax of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less, or by certified mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of tax of more than five hundred dollars ($500.00); provided, however, that, in either case and at the option of the department, the final assessment (or a copy thereof) may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(5)  Procedure for appeal from final assessment . 
a.  A taxpayer may appeal from any final assessment entered by the department by filing a notice of appeal with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the final assessment, and such appeal, if timely filed shall proceed as provided in this section for appeals to the board. 
b.  The filing of the notice of appeal with the board is jurisdictional. If such prerequisite is not satisfied within the time provided for appeal, the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal to the board, the final assessment shall be prima facie correct, and the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to prove such assessment is incorrect. 
c.  The board or the circuit court or the appellate court on appeal may increase or decrease the assessment to reflect the correct amount due. If a final assessment is reduced on appeal, any overpayment of tax paid by the taxpayer shall immediately be refunded to the taxpayer by the city or other entity to which the overpayment was distributed. No court shall have the power to enjoin the collection of any taxes due on such assessment so appealed or to suspend the payment thereof. 
(6)  Jeopardy assessment . 
a.  If the revenue officer or his delegate finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from the city or to remove his property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect any tax imposed by the city, the revenue officer or his delegate may issue notice of such finding to the taxpayer by personal service or mailing to his last known address, together with a demand for immediate payment of the tax declared to be in jeopardy, including penalties and additions thereto and such tax, penalty, interest and additions thereto shall be immediately due and payable. A final assessment of such tax may be entered immediately and if the assessment is not paid upon such demand of the revenue officer, the revenue officer may forthwith issue a warrant for levy and distraint of any personal property of the taxpayer which shall be collected in the same manner and with the effect as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 40-29-20-40-29-34. 
b.  In the case of a tax for a current period, the revenue officer, or his delegate may declare the taxable period of the taxpayer immediately terminated and may at his discretion estimate the tax liability based upon the best information obtainable. Notice of such finding and declaration shall be issued to the taxpayer in the same manner as in subsection (b)(6)a. of this section. 
c.  When a jeopardy assessment has been made as provided in subsection (b)(6)a. of this section, the collection of all or any part of such assessment may be stayed by filing with the revenue officer or his delegate an approved bond, conditioned upon the payment of the assessment, together with applicable interest and costs of collection. The revenue officer shall have sole discretion to approve or disapprove the bond, but such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
d.  In any proceeding in court to contest the jeopardy assessment or to enforce payment of the taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this section, the finding of the revenue officer or his delegate, made as provided in this section, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy. 
e.  A final jeopardy assessment entered hereunder may be appealed to the board in the same manner as provided for appeals from final assessments. 
(c)  Procedure governing petitions for refund; appeals therefrom. 
(1)  Petition for refund allowed; generally. Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the department for any overpayment of tax or other amount erroneously paid to the department or concerning any refund which the department is required to administer. However, if a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the department, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment plus applicable interest has been paid in full prior to or with the filing of such petition for refund. In the case of a petition for refund of sales or use taxes, gasoline taxes or lodging tax, such petition must be filed jointly by the taxpayer who collected and paid over the tax to the department and the consumer/purchaser who paid the tax to the taxpayer. However, a direct petition may be filed by the taxpayer if the taxpayer never collected the tax from the consumer/purchaser, or if the tax has been credited or repaid to the consumer/purchaser by the taxpayer. 
(2)  Time limitation for filing petition for refund; automatic refund. 
a.  Generally. A petition for refund must be filed with the department or an automatic refund pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b. of this section made, or a credit allowed within three (3) years from the date the return was filed, or two (2) years from the date of payment of the tax, whichever is later. 
b.  Automatic refund. Where the department determines that a refund is due on any erroneously paid taxes, the amount of overpayment of any excess tax, plus accrued interest at the rate of one percent per month may first be credited by the department against any outstanding final tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the department, and the balance of such overpayment, if any, shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided, however, that the statute of limitation provisions of the applicable tax law shall apply. 
(3)  Department required to grant or deny refunds; time limitations. The department must either grant or deny a petition for refund within six (6) months from the date the petition is filed, unless such period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the department. The taxpayer shall be notified of the department's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class United States mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the department fails to grant a refund within the time provided in this section, then such petition for refund shall be deemed to be denied. 
(4)  Procedures if refunds granted; credit of refund; payment of other taxes; payment of interest. If a petition is granted, or the department otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the city or other entity to which the overpayment was distributed. However, if the department determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus accrued interest may first be credited by the department against any outstanding final tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the department, and the balance of such overpayment, if any, shall, be refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the department, the department shall provide a written detailed statement to the taxpayer showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and amount refunded. 
(5)  Procedures if refund denied; appeal . 
a.  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the board within two (2) years from the date the petition is denied, and such appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as provided in this subsection for appeals to the board. 
b.  If such appeal is not filed with the board within two (2) years of the date the petition is denied, then such appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 127-07, § 1, 12-4-07) 
Sec. 14-6. - Procedures governing the denial or revocation of licenses administered by the department; procedures for contesting any other act or failure to act by the department appeals therefrom. 
(a)  When the revenue officer finds that revocation or suspension of a license appears necessary, the director will so advise the mayor of his findings, and will request that action be initiated towards the submission of an appropriate resolution to the council for its consideration. A copy of both the request to the mayor and the proposed resolution will be forwarded to the licensee. If the council determines the license in question shall be revoked or suspended, the council shall adopt either the resolution as submitted or one of its own revoking or suspending the license. The licensee will be notified of council action by the city clerk. Such notice to licensee shall advise that such revocation or suspension shall become final at the second regular meeting of the council following passage of the resolution, unless the licensee shall appear before council at such time and place stated in such notice and then and there show good cause why such revocation or suspension action should not be finalized. The notice to the licensee shall set a time and place for the hearing. If the licensee or his counsel fails to appear at such hearing, then revocation or suspension action shall be finalized. Notice of such final action shall be given to the licensee by the city clerk. Posting of such in the United States mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the address on file in the department shall constitute completed action on the part of the city in regards to delivery of the final action to the licensee. 
(b)  This section shall not apply to the procedures governing assessments and refunds which are otherwise provided for by this article or to interdepartmental personnel actions or any matter which is the subject of any action then pending in state or federal court, or to the collection of any liability due the department. 
(c)  This section shall not apply to the procedures governing the denial, revocation or suspension of business licenses. All procedures for the administration of, denial, revocation or suspension of business licenses are set out in article XII of this chapter. 
(d)  A taxpayer may appeal any matter governed by this section to the circuit court. Any appeal to the circuit court must be from a final order issued by the council. 
(Ord. No. 127-07, § 1, 12-4-07) 
Sec. 14-7. - Procedures governing appeals to the board; authority of board of revenue appeals. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish uniform procedures concerning appeals to the board and to establish the authority and responsibilities of the board concerning such appeals. The provisions of this section should be liberally construed to provide for the fair, efficient and complete resolution of all matters in dispute. 
(b)  Authority of board of revenue appeals. The board shall have the authority to schedule and conduct hearings and decide all appeals properly filed with the board. The board shall have the discretion to dismiss any appeal for failure or refusal to comply with any department regulation or statute concerning appeals to the board or for the failure or refusal to comply with any preliminary order issued by the board. If an appeal is dismissed by the board for any reason, then for good cause shown, the board may reinstate the appeal. However, no appeal may be reinstated unless a motion to reinstate such appeal is filed with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of the order dismissing the appeal, or the appeal is reinstated by the board within such period. An order dismissing an appeal may be appealed to circuit court in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as appeals from final orders of the board. The order shall be upheld by the circuit court unless the court finds an abuse of discretion by the board or that the order is otherwise unreasonable. 
(c)  Prehearing procedures. The notice of appeal filed with the board shall, by specific reference, identify the assessment, refund or other act or refusal to act which is the subject of the appeal, the position of appealing party (taxpayer), the basis on which relief should be granted, and the relief sought on the appeal. The board shall notify the city attorney that an appeal has been filed, and the city attorney shall be required to file a written answer with the board within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice. The answer shall state the facts and issues in dispute and the department's position relating thereto; however, the board shall have discretion to require additional information from either the taxpayer or the department or to allow the city attorney additional time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, within which to file an answer. 
(d)  Hearings. An appeal may be held in abeyance by agreement of the parties or at the discretion of the board, or an appeal may be submitted for decision on a joint stipulation of facts without a hearing. Otherwise, a hearing shall be conducted by the board. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the taxpayer's last known address. The board shall conduct the hearing substantially as follows: 
(1)  Open the record and receive appearances; 
(2)  Receive testimony and exhibits presented by the parties. All testimony shall be made under oath and any person testifying under oath shall be subject to the perjury provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, § 13A-10-102; 
(3)  Further interrogate witnesses if deemed necessary; 
(4)  Require oral arguments and submission of briefs and other authorities if deemed necessary; and 
(5)  Continue or reopen the hearing for the taking of additional evidence as deemed necessary for a fair, efficient, and complete resolution of the matter or matters in dispute. 
(e)  Final order. A final order shall be entered by the board which shall contain findings fact and conclusions of law. The final order shall provide such relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances. Any final order, unless altered or amended on appeal, shall have the same force and effect as a final order issued by a circuit judge sitting in the state. 
(f)  Application for rehearing. Either the taxpayer or the department may file an application for rehearing within fifteen (15) days from the date of entry of a final order by the board. The application for rehearing shall set forth the specific reasons and supporting arguments why the final order is incorrect and should be reheard. The timely filing of an application for rehearing shall suspend the time period for filing an appeal to circuit court and the time for filing a notice of appeal shall be computed from the date of entry of the order of the board either granting or denying the application for rehearing. 
(g)  Appeals to circuit court. 
(1)  Either the taxpayer or the department may appeal to circuit court from a final order issued by the board by filing a notice of appeal with the board and with the circuit court within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the final order. Any appeal by the department shall be filed with the circuit court. If the appeal to circuit court is by a taxpayer from a final order involving a final assessment, the taxpayer, at the time of filing the appeal, shall be required to pay that part of the final assessment upheld by the final order of the board, plus interest, or the taxpayer may execute a supersedeas bond, which shall be executed by a surety company licensed to do business in the state, in double the amount of that part of the final assessment upheld by the final order of the board payable to the city and conditioned to pay the final assessment, plus applicable interest due the city and any court cost relating to the appeal. If a taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the clerk of the circuit court that he has a net worth (based on fair market value) of twenty thousand ($20,000.00) or less, including his homestead, then such taxpayer may take such appeal without either paying the tax in full or posting a supersedeas bond in double the amount of the assessment. The circuit court shall dismiss any appeal that is not timely filed as herein provided, or, concerning appeals from final assessments, if the amount of the assessment upheld by the final order of the board is not timely paid in full or a supercedes bond is not timely filed as required in this section. 
(2)  The appeal to circuit court from an order issued by the board shall be a trial de novo, provided the order of the board shall be presumed prima facie correct and burden shall be upon the appealing party to show otherwise. The circuit court shall hear the case in accordance with its own rules and shall decide all questions of fact and law; provided, however, that the administrative record and transcript shall be transmitted to the reviewing court as provided in this section, and shall be admitted into evidence in the trial de novo, subject to the rights of either party to assign errors, objections or motions to exclude calling attention to any testimony or any evidence in the administrative record or transcript which is deemed objectionable or inadmissible. Notwithstanding the above, with the consent of all parties, judicial review may be on the administrative record and transcript. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs. 
(h)  Prehearing conferences, preliminary orders. The board shall have authority to hold prehearing conferences and issue preliminary orders. 
(i)  Record of hearing; record on appeal . All hearings shall be recorded by a qualified court reporter or mechanically recorded and the proceedings shall be transcribed at the request of either the department, the taxpayer or the board with the expense of transcription charged to the requesting party. The record of the proceedings or transcript thereof shall be maintained by the board for at least five (5) years: provided, however, that upon appeal to the circuit court by either party, the board shall cause the hearing to be transcribed and shall forward the original transcript or a certified copy of the transcript along with the administrative record to circuit court for use in the appeal. 
(j)  Rules of evidence at administrative hearing. The rules of evidence applicable in civil nonjury cases in the circuit courts of the state shall be followed. However, when necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible to proof under those rules of evidence, evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted, in the discretion of the board if relevant or of the type commonly relied upon by prudent persons. The board may announce prior to or during a hearing that it shall not be necessary for either party to make objections during the hearing to any testimony or evidence offered by either party, and such objections shall be preserved and may be made on appeal; provided, however, that the final order issued by the board shall be based only on such evidence as is relevant, competent and material. Documentary evidence may be received in copy form if an opportunity to review the original is available and there is no objection thereto. Official notice may be taken of any technical facts within the specialized knowledge of the board, and the experience, technical competency and specialized knowledge of the board shall be utilized in evaluating the evidence and issuing decisions based thereon, and shall be given appropriate weight in considering the order of the board. 
(k)  Authorized representatives; appearance at hearing. A taxpayer may be represented before the board by an authorized representative. If a taxpayer or his authorized representative fails to appear at a hearing after proper service of notice, the board may, in its discretion, dismiss the appeal with prejudice, adjourn the proceeding and reset the matter for a subsequent hearing, or proceed with the hearing. 
(l)  Intervention. Any person may, upon application, be permitted to intervene in any proceeding before the board if the person's individual rights are or may be affected by the outcome of the proceeding and the person's interest is otherwise not adequately represented in the case. 
(m)  Public records. All testimony, exhibits, documents and other materials introduced into evidence at a hearing before the board and all final and other orders issued by the board shall be deemed public information except: 
(1)  In those cases where information received from the Internal Revenue Service or state department of revenue or other government agency is restricted by law or agreement from disclosure; and 
(2)  As otherwise ordered by the board. 
(Ord. No. 127-07, § 1, 12-4-07) 
Sec. 14-8. - Confidentiality, disclosure of tax return information and provisions for the exchange of tax information. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to print, publish or divulge the return of any taxpayer or any part thereof or any information secured in arriving at the amount of tax or value reported for any purpose other than the proper administration of any matter administered by the department, or upon order of any court, or as otherwise allowed in this section, However, statistical information pertaining to taxes may be disclosed at the discretion of the revenue officer or delegate or to the legislative or executive branch of the city or the state. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall, for each act of disclosure, have committed an offense. 
(b)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to returns filed and information secured under laws of this state levying or imposing excise taxes upon the sale of, use and other disposition of gasoline and other petroleum products, or governing the licensing of motor vehicle dealers, reconditioners, rebuilders, wholesalers, and automotive dismantlers and parts recyclers. 
(c)  The orders of the board and all evidence submitted in any hearing before the board shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(d)  The revenue officer shall promulgate reasonable regulations permitting and governing the exchange of tax returns, information, records and other documents secured by the department, with tax officers of other agencies of the state, municipal, and county government agencies in the state, federal government agencies, any association of state government tax agencies, any state government tax agencies of other states and any foreign government tax agencies; provided, however, that: 
(1)  Any such tax returns, information, records, or other documents remain subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and 
(2)  Such exchange must be for one or more of the following purposes: 
a.  Collecting taxes due; 
b.  Ascertaining the amount of taxes due from any person; and 
c.  Determining whether a person is liable for, or whether there is probable cause for believing such person might be liable for, the payment of any tax to such federal, state, county, municipal or foreign government agency. 
(e)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use of tax returns or tax information by the department or county assessing officials in the enforcement, collection and assessment of any tax levied or imposed by the city, or any other matters administered by the department. Furthermore, nothing in this section shall preclude the inspection of returns by agents of the state department of revenue or by federal or foreign state agents as provided under Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-18-53. 
(Ord. No. 127-07, § 1, 12-4-07) 
Sec. 14-9. - Civil penalties and interest. 
(a)  Failure to timely file return. If a taxpayer fails to file any return required to be filed with the department with the exception of general business licenses and applications, on or before the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), there shall be assessed as a penalty the greater of ten (10) percent of any additional tax required to be paid with such return or $50.00. 
(b)  Failure to timely pay tax. If a taxpayer fails to pay to the department the correct amount of tax due on or before the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), with the exception of general business licenses and applications, there shall be added as a penalty one percent of the amount of such tax due if the failure to pay is for not more than one month, with an additional one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure to pay continues, not exceeding twenty-five (25) percent in the aggregate. However, in lieu of the penalty provided in the immediately preceding sentence, for any tax for which a monthly or quarterly return is required, or for which no return is required, the department shall add a failure to timely pay penalty of ten (10) percent of the delinquent tax. 
(c)  Underpayment due to negligence. If any part of any underpayment of tax with the exception of general business license fees or taxes is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five (5) percent of that part of the tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations. For purposes of this subsection, the term "negligence" includes any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax articles of the city, or with the provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, title 40 (Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-1-1 et seq.), as may be applicable and the term "disregard" includes any careless, reckless or intentional disregard. 
(d)  Underpayment due to fraud. If any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of that portion of such underpayment which is attributable to fraud. For purposes of this section, the term "fraud" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to the term under 26 USC 6663, as in effect from time to time. 
(e)  Frivolous return penalty. If any taxpayer files a "frivolous return," as that term is used in 26 USC 6702, such taxpayer may be liable for a penalty of up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(f)  Frivolous appeal penalty. If any appeal to the board or circuit court is determined to be frivolous or primarily for the purpose of delay or to impede collection of any tax, a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or twenty-five (25) percent of the tax in question, whichever is greater, shall be assessed in addition to any tax due. 
(g)  Penalties not exclusive. The penalties provided in this section for failure to timely file a return, failure to timely pay tax, filing a frivolous return, filing a frivolous appeal, or negligence may be asserted against the same taxpayer for the same tax period. If the fraud penalty is asserted, no other penalties shall be asserted. 
(h)  Waiver of penalties. The department is authorized to reduce or waiver any penalties upon a determination of reasonable cause. Reasonable cause shall include, but not be limited to, those instances where the taxpayer has acted in good faith in filing a return or reporting or paying any tax. However, the burden of proving reasonable cause shall be on the tax payer. 
(i)  Interest. All delinquent accounts (both taxes and penalties) shall also be charged interest at the rate of one percent per month.

(b)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the municipality within two (2) years from the date of payment of the business license tax, which is the subject of the petition. 
(c)  The municipality shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six (6) months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the municipality. The taxpayer shall be notified of the municipality's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class U.S. mail or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the municipality fails to grant a full refund within the time provided herein, the refund petition shall be deemed to be denied.

If the municipality determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus any interest due thereon may first be credited by the municipality against any outstanding tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the municipality, and the balance of any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer.

(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year.

(f)  A taxpayer that otherwise meets the criteria for the purchase of a delivery license is not required to purchase a delivery license or a regular business license if: 
(1)  The taxpayer's gross receipts that are derived from within the municipality do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00); and 
(2)  The taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality during the year.

(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided in section 16-30, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 16-30, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subdivision (3)b. 
b.  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subdivision (3)a. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 16-30, pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(4)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such signal or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

Sec. 16-31. - Flashing signals. 
(a)  Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.

(a)  A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by submitting a request for an adjudication hearing of the civil penalty, in writing, within fifteen (15) days of the tenth day after the date of the notice of violation is mailed. Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall notify the person of the date and time of the municipal court hearing on the adjudication. The adjudicative hearing hall be held before a municipal judge. 
(b)  Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation. 
(c)  The civil penalty shall not be assessed if after a hearing the municipal judge enters a finding of no liability. 
(d)  In the adjudicative hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to in the adjudicative hearing by affidavit of an officer or employee of the city or the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the city that alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this article and is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit. 
(e)  The notice of violation, the recorded and reproduced images of the traffic signal violation, regardless of the media on which they are recorded, accompanied by a certification of authenticity of a trained technician, and evidence of ownership of a vehicle as shown by copies or summaries of official records shall be admissible into evidence without foundation unless the municipal court finds there is an indication of untrustworthiness, in which case the city shall be given a reasonable opportunity to lay an evidentiary foundation. 
(f)  A person who is found liable after an adjudicative hearing or who requests an adjudicative hearing and thereafter fails to appear at the time and place of the hearing is liable for municipal court costs and fees in the amount of ten dollars ($10.00) in addition to the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation. A person who is found liable for a civil penalty after an adjudicative hearing shall pay the civil penalty and costs within ten (10) days of the hearing. The ten dollars ($10.00) shall be paid to the Alabama Criminal Justice Information Center as compensation for record keeping with respect to violation notices issued under this Act. 
(g)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently visible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 32-5A-7 and 32-5-213 and that the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was stolen or being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this article more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance; or 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(h)  To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(i)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an adjudicative hearing in municipal court on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the municipal court stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation that was mailed to the person, if not received by the tenth (10th) day after same is mailed as set out in subsection (a) above; and 
(2)  Within the fifteen (15) days of the date of actual receipt, the person requests an adjudicative hearing. 
(j)  If the evidence produced by a photographic traffic signal enforcement system does not produce an image of the license plate with sufficient clarity for a trained technician to determine the identity of the owner, and if the identity cannot otherwise be reliably established, then no notice of violation may be issued pursuant to this Act. If, however, a notice of violation is issued, to the degree constitutionally allowed, those issues related to the identity of the vehicle or its owner shall affect the weight to be accorded the evidence and shall not affect its admissibility. 
(Ord. No. 112-11, § 1, 8-16-11) 
Sec. 16-305. - Order. 
(a)  The municipal judge at any adjudicative hearing under this article shall issue an order stating:

(2)  The amount of any civil penalty, late penalty, and adjudicative cost assessed against the person. 
(b)  The orders issued under subsection (a) above shall be filed in the office of the municipal court. The municipal court shall keep the orders in a separate index and file. The orders shall be recorded using microfilm, microfiche, or other data processing techniques.

The notice of appeal must be filed not later than the fourteenth day after the date on which the municipal judge entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the circuit court by trial de novo. 
(b)  The circuit court hearing on appeal shall use the procedures that apply to criminal convictions in municipal court with the following qualifications: 
(1)  Proceedings shall retain their civil nature on appeal with the circuit court applying the preponderance of the evidence standard. 
(2)  If the person is adjudicated by the circuit court to be responsible for the payment of the fine, circuit court costs shall be owed by the person adjudicated responsible, with one hundred (100) percent of those court costs retained by the circuit court. Court costs in the circuit court shall be calculated as court costs for criminal appeals from the municipal court, and in the event the circuit court finds the person appealing to not be responsible, no municipal court costs shall be owed to the city. 
(3)  The circuit court may assign case numbers as for criminal appeals and place the appeals on criminal dockets in the same manner as criminal appeals from municipal court. 
(4)  The circuit court shall sit as trier of both fact and law in the civil proceedings in the circuit court. 
(5)  The city shall be responsible for providing an attorney to represent the city and to prosecute the civil proceedings in circuit court.

Sec. 16-307. - Effect of liability; exclusion of civil remedy. 
(a)  No person may be arrested or incarcerated for nonpayment of a civil fine or late fee. The imposition of a civil penalty under this article is not a criminal conviction for any purpose. 
(b)  A civil penalty may not be imposed under this article on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a citation and notice to appear by a peace officer for a criminal violation of any portion of Code of Ala. 1975, article II, chapter 5A, title 32 (§§ 32-5A-31, 32-5A-34 and 32-5A-35), or any other municipal ordinance that embraces and incorporates the said statutes, that occurred simultaneously with and under the same set of facts which were recorded by the photographic traffic signal enforcement system. 
(c)  No record of an adjudication of civil penalty made under this article shall be listed, entered, or reported on any criminal record or driving record, whether the record is maintained by the city or an outside agency. 
(d)  An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty or to timely contest liability for the penalty is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person. 
(e)  The city attorney or his designee is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of a civil penalty imposed under this Article.

Sec. 16-450. - Findings. 
    The council adopts the following findings of fact: 
(a)  The city's local and collector streets are not designed or constructed to sustain consistent traffic by large trucks and other heavy vehicles and are susceptible to damage from excessive use thereby. 
(b)  The city's local and collector streets are typically narrow and their width is often further constrained by the presence of other on-street parking areas. 
(c)  The city's local and collector streets typically contain relatively small corner and centerline radiuses impeding the turning ability of larger vehicles. 
(d)  The city's arterial roadways are designed and constructed to higher road bearing standards than the city's local and collector streets. 
(e)  Widespread operation of large trucks and other heavy vehicles upon the city's residential streets will likely cause extensive damage to street surfaces and require costly, repeated repairs at the city's expense and would jeopardize vehicular and pedestrian safety. 
(f)  Limiting truck routes established by this article will provide an adequate opportunity for truck circulation while simultaneously protecting local street. 
(g)  Limiting the vehicular transport of hazardous and/or radioactive materials to truck routes established by this article will help to ensure a more expedient and effective emergency response in the event of an accident or spill.

An itemized statement of the expenses shall be provided by certified mail with signature receipt required to the last known address of the owner of the property.

Sec. 18-24. - Interference with city officials and employees 
    No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with any official, agent or representative of the city while engaged in the execution or enforcement of this article provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as an attempt to prohibit the pursuit of any remedy, legal or equitable, in any court of competent jurisdiction for the protection of property rights by the owner of any property within the city.

Sec. 18-48. - Determination of abandonment. 
    The following criteria shall be used to determine whether or not a vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is abandoned: 
(1)  The vehicle fails to display a current license plate, and it is partially dismantled or wrecked or incapable of self-propulsion or of being moved in the manner for which it was originally intended; or 
(2)  The vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is left on private property without the consent of the owner, occupant or lessee thereof for a period of time exceeding twenty-four (24) consecutive hours; or 
(3)  The vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is left on any public street or highway or in any parking garage of the city for a period of time greater than seven (7) consecutive days; or 
(4)  The vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is left on any property owned or operated by the city other than that as described in subsection (3) hereof for a period of time greater than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours.

Sec. 18-50. - Notice to be affixed. 
(a)  Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer may be abandoned within a street or highway, or upon the right-of-way of a street or highway, he/she shall securely affix to the windshield or to the driver's side door of the vehicle, or to the side of the trailer or semi-trailer, a conspicuous warning notice, indicating that the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is believed to be abandoned and is in violation of this article. The notice shall further state that if the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is not removed within the time period written on the notice, the same shall be removed and impounded.

The notice shall further state that if the vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is not removed within the time period written on the notice, the same shall be removed and impounded. However, removal and impoundment of a vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer abandoned upon private property first requires consent of the property owner or a court order.

(3)  When any vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer is left unattended upon a street or any other public way or place, and is parked so illegally as to constitute a hazard or obstruction to the normal flow of traffic; 
(4)  When the driver of such vehicle is taken into custody by the police department and such vehicle would thereby be left unattended upon a street or other public way or place; 
(5)  When removal is necessary in the interest of public safety because of fire, flood, storm or other emergency reason;

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Secs. 19-16-19-25. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - CULPABILITY 

Sec. 19-26. - Definitions generally. 
    The following definitions apply to this chapter: 
    Act: A bodily movement, and such term includes possession of property. 
    Voluntary act: An act performed consciously as a result of effort or determination, and such term includes the possession of property if the actor was aware of his physical possession or control thereof for a sufficient time to have been able to terminate it. 
    Omission: A failure to perform an act as to which a duty of performance is imposed by law. 
    Conduct: An act or omission and its accompanying mental state. 
    To act: Either to perform an act or to omit to perform an act. 
    Culpable mental state: Such term means "intentionally" or "knowingly" or "recklessly" or with "criminal negligence," as these terms are defined in this chapter. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-1. 
Sec. 19-27. - Definitions of culpable mental state. 
    The following definitions apply to this chapter: 
    Intentionally: A person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense, when his purpose is to cause that result or to engage in that conduct. 
    Knowingly: A person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute or ordinance defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that the circumstance exists. 
    Recklessly: A person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute or ordinance defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A person who creates a risk but is unaware thereof solely by reason of voluntary intoxication, as defined in this chapter, acts recklessly with respect thereto. 
    Criminal negligence: A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance which is defined by statute or ordinance as an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. A court may consider statutes or ordinances regulating the defendant's conduct as bearing upon the question of criminal negligence. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-2. 
Sec. 19-28. - Requirements for criminal liability in general and for offenses of strict liability and of mental culpability. 
    The minimum requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which he is physically capable of performing. If that conduct is all that is required for commission of a particular offense, or if an offense or some material element thereof does not require a culpable mental state on the part of the actor, the offense is one of "strict liability." If a culpable mental state on the part of the actor is required with respect to any material element of an offense, the offense is one of "mental culpability." 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-3. 
Sec. 19-29. - Construction with respect to culpability requirements. 
(a)  When a statute or ordinance defining an offense prescribes as an element thereof a specified culpable mental state, such mental state is presumed to apply to every element of the offense unless the context thereof indicates to the contrary. 
(b)  Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute or ordinance defining an offense, an appropriate culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense, or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof, if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such culpable mental state. A statute or ordinance defining a crime, unless clearly indicating a legislative intent to impose strict liability, states a crime of mental culpability. 
(c)  If a statute or ordinance provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts recklessly, knowingly or intentionally. If recklessness suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts knowingly and intentionally. If acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-4. 
Sec. 19-30. - Casual relationship between conduct and results; relationship to mental culpability. 
(a)  A person is criminally liable if the result would not have occurred but for his conduct, operating either alone or concurrently with another cause, unless the concurrent cause was sufficient to produce the result and the conduct of the actor clearly insufficient. 
(b)  A person is nevertheless criminally liable for causing a result if the only difference between that which actually occurred and what he intended, contemplated or risked is that: 
(1)  A different person or property was injured, harmed or affected; or 
(2)  A less serious or less extensive injury or harm occurred. 
(c)  When causing a particular result is a material element of an offense for which absolute liability is imposed by law, the element is not established unless the actual result is a probable consequence of the actor's conduct. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-5. 
Sec. 19-31. - Effect of ignorance or mistake upon liability. 
(a)  A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in that conduct under a mistaken belief of fact unless: 
(1)  His factual mistake negatives the culpable mental state required for the commission of an offense; or 
(2)  The statute or ordinance defining the offense or a statute or ordinance related thereto expressly provides that such a factual mistake constitutes a defense or exemption; or 
(3)  The factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification as defined in this chapter. 
(b)  A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in that conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless his mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained in a statute or the latest judicial decision of the highest state or federal court which has decided on the matter. 
(c)  The burden of injecting the issue of mistake of law under subsection (b) of this section is on the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of proof. 
(d)  A mistake of law, other than as to the existence or meaning of the statute or ordinance under which the defendant is prosecuted, is relevant to disprove the specific state of mental culpability required by the statute or ordinance under which the defendant is prosecuted. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-6. 
Sec. 19-32. - Consent. 
(a)  The consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof, is a defense if such consent negatives a required element of the offense or precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense. 
(b)  When conduct is charged to constitute an offense because it causes or threatens bodily harm, consent to such conduct or to the infliction of such harm is a defense only if: 
(1)  The bodily harm consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not serious; or 
(2)  The conduct and the harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport; or 
(3)  The consent establishes a justification for the conduct under this chapter. 
(c)  Unless otherwise provided by this chapter or by the law defining the offense, assent does not constitute consent if: 
(1)  It is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct; or 
(2)  It is given by a person who by reason of immaturity, mental disease or defect, or intoxication is manifestly unable and known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct; or 
(3)  It is given by a person whose consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense; or 
(4)  It is induced by force, duress or deception.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-24. 
Sec. 19-43. - Conduct of an innocent person. 
(a)  A person is legally accountable for the behavior of another if, acting with the culpable mental state sufficient for the commission of the offense in question, he causes an innocent person to engage in such behavior. 
(b)  As used in this section, an "innocent person" includes any person who is not guilty of the offense in question, despite his behavior, because of: 
(1)  Criminal irresponsibility or other legal incapacity or exemption. 
(2)  Unawareness of the criminal nature of the conduct in question or of the defendant's criminal purpose. 
(3)  Any other factor precluding the mental state sufficient for the commission of the offense in question. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-22. 
Sec. 19-44. - Same-Complicity. 
    A person is legally accountable for the behavior of another constituting a criminal offense if, with the intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense: 
(1)  He procures, induces or causes such other person to commit the offense; or 
(2)  He aids or abets such other person in committing the offense; or 
(3)  Having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, he fails to make an effort he is legally required to make. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-23. 
Sec. 19-45. - Same-Exceptions. 
    Unless otherwise provided by the statute or ordinance defining the offense, a person shall not be legally accountable for behavior of another constituting a criminal offense if: 
(1)  He is a victim of that offense; or 
(2)  The offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incidental to its commission; or 
(3)  Prior to the commission of the offense, he voluntarily terminated his effort to promote or assist its commission and either gave timely and adequate warning to law enforcement authorities, or to the intended victim, or wholly deprived his complicity of its effectiveness in the commission of the offense. The burden of injecting this issue is on the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of proof. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-2-24. 
Sec. 19-46. - Certain defenses not available. 
    In a prosecution for an offense in which criminal liability is based upon the behavior of another person pursuant to this division, it is no defense that: 
(1)  Such other person has not been prosecuted for or convicted of any offense based upon the behavior in question, or has been previously acquitted thereof, or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense. 
(2)  The defendant belongs to a class of persons who, by definition of the offense, are legally incapable of committing the offense in an individual capacity.

Sec. 19-47. - Criminal liability of an individual for corporate conduct.

Sec. 19-62. - Intoxication. 
(a)  Intoxication is not a defense to a criminal charge, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section. However, intoxication, whether voluntary or involuntary, is admissible in evidence whenever it is relevant to negate an element of the offense charged. 
(b)  When recklessness establishes an element of an offense and the actor is unaware of a risk because of voluntary intoxication, his unawareness is immaterial in a prosecution for that offense. 
(c)  Involuntary intoxication is a defense to prosecution if as a result the actor lacks capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. 
(d)  Intoxication in itself does not constitute mental disease or defect within the meaning of this chapter. 
(e)  In this section: 
(1)  "Intoxication" includes a disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of any substance into the body. 
(2)  "Voluntary intoxication" means intoxication caused by substances that the actor knowingly introduced into his body, the tendency of which to cause intoxication he knows or ought to know, unless he introduces them under circumstances that would afford a defense to a charge of crime.

(1)  If he is in his dwelling or at his place of work and was not the original aggressor; or 
(2)  If he is a peace officer or a private person lawfully assisting a peace officer at his direction.

ARTICLE IV. - INCHOATE CRIMES 

Sec. 19-96. - Criminal solicitation. 
(a)  A person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with the intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a crime, he solicits, requests, commands or importunes such other person to engage in such conduct. 
    A person may not be convicted of criminal solicitation upon the uncorroborated testimony of the person allegedly solicited, and there must be proof of circumstances corroborating both the solicitation and the defendant's intent. 
(b)  A person is not liable under this section if, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, he: 
(1)  Notified the person solicited of his renunciation; and 
(2)  Gave timely and adequate warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise made a substantial effort to prevent the commission of the criminal conduct solicited. 
The burden of injecting this issue is on the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of proof. 
(c)  A person is not liable under this section when his solicitation constitutes conduct of a kind that is necessarily incidental to the commission of the offense solicited. When the solicitation constitutes an offense other than criminal solicitation which is related to but separate from the offense solicited, defendant is guilty of such related offense only and not of criminal solicitation. 
(d)  It is no defense to a prosecution for criminal solicitation that the person solicited could not be guilty of the offense solicited because of: 
(1)  Criminal irresponsibility or other legal incapacity or exemption; or 
(2)  Unawareness of the criminal nature of the conduct solicited or of the defendant's criminal purpose; or 
(3)  Any other factor precluding the mental state required for the commission of the offense in question. 
(e)  It is no defense to a prosecution for criminal solicitation that defendant belongs to a class of persons who by definition are legally incapable in an individual capacity of committing the offense that he solicited another to commit. 
(f)  This section shall not apply if the offense solicited is a murder or a felony. 
(g)  Criminal solicitation is a misdemeanor.

(b)  It is no defense under this section that the offense charged to have been attempted was, under the attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the defendant believed them to be. 
(c)  A person is not liable under this section if, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, he avoided the commission of the offense attempted by abandoning his criminal effort and, if mere abandonment is insufficient to accomplish such avoidance, by taking further and affirmative steps which prevented the commission thereof. The burden of injecting this issue is on the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of proof. 
(d)  This section shall not apply if the offense attempted was murder or a felony. 
(e)  An attempt is a misdemeanor. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Ala., § 13A-4-2. 
Sec. 19-98. - Criminal conspiracy generally. 
(a)  A person is guilty of criminal conspiracy if, with the intent that conduct constituting an offense be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one or more of such persons does an overt act to effect an objective of the agreement. 
(b)  If a person knows or should know that one with whom he agrees has in turn agreed or will agree with another to effect the same criminal objective, he shall be deemed to have agreed with such other person, whether or not he knows the owner's identity. 
(c)  A person is not liable under this section if, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal purpose, he gave a timely and adequate warning to law enforcement authorities or made a substantial effort to prevent the enforcement of the criminal conduct contemplated by the conspiracy. Renunciation by one conspirator, however, does not affect the liability of another conspirator who does not join in the abandonment of the conspiratorial objective. The burden of injecting the issue of renunciation is on the defendant, but this does not shift the burden of proof. 
(d)  It is no defense to a prosecution for criminal conspiracy that: 
(1)  The person, or persons, with whom defendant is alleged to have conspired has been acquitted, has not been prosecuted or convicted, has been convicted of a different offense or is immune from prosecution, or 
(2)  The person, or persons, with whom defendant conspired could not be guilty of the conspiracy or the object crime because of lack of mental responsibility or culpability, or other legal incapacity or defense, or 
(3)  The defendant belongs to a class of persons who by definition are legally incapable in an individual capacity of committing the offense that is the object of the conspiracy. 
(e)  A conspirator is not liable under this section if, had the criminal conduct contemplated by the conspiracy actually been performed, he would be immune from liability under the law defining the offense or as an accomplice under section 19-80 of this Code. 
(f)  Accomplice liability for offenses committed in furtherance of a conspiracy is to be determined as provided in section 19-79 of this Code. 
(g)  This section shall not apply if an object of the conspiracy is murder or a felony. 
(h)  Criminal conspiracy is a misdemeanor.

(b)  A person may not be convicted on the basis of the same course of conduct of both the actual commission of an offense and: 
(1)  An attempt to commit the offense; or 
(2)  Criminal solicitation of the offense; or

d.  Prevents another from acquiring information pertinent to the disposition of the property involved; or

    Commodities of a public utility nature, such as gas, electricity, steam and water, constitute property, but the supply of such a commodity to premises from an outside source by means of wires, pipes, conduits or other equipment shall be deemed a rendition of a service rather than a sale or delivery of property. 
(11)  Receiving: Such term includes, but is not limited to, acquiring possession, control or title and taking a security interest in the property. 
(12)  Stolen: Obtained by theft, theft by appropriating lost property, robbery or extortion.

In such case, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but only that one or the other was false and not believed by the defendant to be true. 
(b)  The highest degree of perjury of which the defendant may be convicted shall be determined by hypothetically assuming each statement to be false and perjurious. If perjury of the same degree would be established by the making of each statement, the accused may be convicted of that degree at most.

Sec. 19-507. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions apply to this article: 
    Advance gambling activity: A person "advances gambling activity" if he engages in conduct that materially aids any form of gambling activity. Conduct of this nature includes but is not limited to conduct directed toward the creation or establishment of the particular game, contest, scheme, device or activity involved, toward the acquisition or maintenance of premises, paraphernalia, equipment or apparatus therefor, toward the solicitation or inducement of persons to participate therein, toward the actual conduct of the playing phases thereof, toward the arrangement of any of its financial or recording phases or toward any other phase of its operation. A person advances gambling activity if, having substantial proprietary control or other authoritative control over premises being used with his knowledge for purposes of gambling activity, he permits that activity to occur or continue or makes no effort to prevent its occurrence or continuation. 
    Bookmaking: Advancing gambling activity by unlawfully accepting bets from members of the public as a business, rather than in a casual or personal fashion, upon the outcome of future contingent events. 
    Contest of chance: Any contest, game, gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein. 
    Gambling: A person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. Gambling does not include bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts, including but not limited to contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, and agreements to compensate for loss caused by the happening of chance, including but not limited to contracts of indemnity or guaranty and life, health or accident insurance. 
    Gambling device: Any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment that is normally used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether that activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person involving the playing of a machine. However, lottery tickets, policy slips and other items used in the playing phases of lottery and policy schemes are not gambling devices within this definition. 
    Lottery or policy: Any unlawful gambling scheme in which: 
a.  The players pay or agree to pay something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other medium, one or more of which chances are to be designated by the winning ones; and 
b.  The winning chances are to be determined by a drawing or by some other fortuitous method; and 
c.  The holders of the winning chances are to receive something of value. 
    Pari-mutuel, mutuel or the numbers game: A form of lottery in which the winning chances or plays are not determined upon the basis of a drawing or other act on the part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but upon the basis of the outcome of a future contingent event or events otherwise unrelated to the particular scheme. 
    Player: A person who engages in any form of gambling solely as a contestant or bettor, without receiving or becoming entitled to receive any profit therefrom other than personal gambling winnings, and without otherwise rendering any material assistance to the establishment, conduct or operation of the particular gambling activity. 
    Profit from gambling activity: A person "profits from gambling activity" if he accepts or receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby he shares or is to share in the proceeds of gambling activity. 
    Slot machine: A gambling device that, as a result of the insertion of a coin or other object, operates, either completely automatically or with the aid of some physical act by the player, in such a manner that, depending upon elements of chance, it may eject something of value. A device so constructed or readily adaptable or convertible to such use is no less a slot machine because it is not in working order or because some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. Nor is it any less a slot machine because apart from its use or adaptability as such it may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance. 
    Something of value: Any money or property, any token, object or article exchangeable for money or property or any form of credit or promise directly or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest therein, or involving extension of a service entertainment or a privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge. 
    Unlawful: Not specifically authorized by law.

(3)  If a funeral escort originates outside the city limits and enters the city, or originates inside the city and travels outside the city limits, it will be the responsibility of the funeral home to contact the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction outside the city limits along the path of the escort route to assume the responsibility for the escort once the procession leaves the city limits. The patrol division will coordinate with outside agencies once that information is provided to the police department from the funeral home handling the services. 
(4)  The use of on-duty personnel is approved provided that adequate personnel are available to address the service demands for the time period, to include but not limited to: patrol coverage, traffic enforcement, calls for service demands, school crossings, etc. 
(5)  The procession will travel in the far right traffic lane at or below the posted speed limit at all times unless roadway construction or other problems are encountered. At that point, the lead police vehicle will establish the safest traffic lane to operate the procession in. 
(6)  All state and local traffic laws as well as city and departmental policies that regulate emergency and non-emergency vehicle operation will be followed. 
(7)  The safety of the public at intersections is paramount, and the officer's attention will be on his/her assignment of stopping and/or controlling traffic at signalized or signed intersections to allow safe passage of the funeral procession. 
(8)  The police department will maintain and report annual statistics on funeral escorts to include the number of escort requests, off-duty hours expended, on-duty hours expended and any other pertinent statistical facts for planning and review.

Sec. 25-1. - Definitions. 
    As used in this article, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them: 
    Secondhand dealer. Any person who buys, sells, or barters in secondhand goods and is not subject to the license requirements under section 25-17 as a pawn broker or section 25-51 as a buyer of secondhand gold or silver. The definition of secondhand dealer includes any person who is engaged in business as a "salvage yard operator", "salvage dealer", "junk dealer", "waste disposal operator" or "recycling operator" and/or any person who deals in junk, or purchases or acquires in any manner or disposes of metals of any kind whatsoever, old pipe, locks, copper wire or similar material. 
    Secondhand goods. Any property of any kind or description which has been previously sold to or owned by a consumer or other person who is not a merchant as defined by the Code of Alabama 1975, § 7-2-104; or that is sold or received as scrap or salvage property; provided, that household furnishings, clothing, automobiles, waste or animal waste shall not be considered secondhand goods within this article. 
(Ord. No. 104-07, § 1, 5-16-07) 
Sec. 25-2. - Record of purchases. 
    Every secondhand dealer shall provide and keep a book and enter therein, as each purchase or acquisition is made, each purchase or acquisition of secondhand goods of every kind and character acquired or purchased, model and serial number, together with the name, age, address and description of the person from whom the respective purchases or acquisitions were made, and the date of the respective purchases or acquisitions. Such book shall be kept for twelve (12) months following the purchase or acquisition and shall be open to inspection during business hours, by any person who may make a request to examine the same. It shall be unlawful to violate this section. 
(Ord. No. 104-07, § 1, 5-16-07) 
Sec. 25-3. - Reports to chief of police. 
    Every secondhand dealer within the city shall report to the chief of police in a manner and time as set out herein, a description of every secondhand good received by him on the previous business day. Reports shall be made every day except Sunday, before the hour of noon. Business done on Saturday shall be so reported by noon on the next Monday. 
(1)  Computerized reporting. 
a.  From and after the date called for the phase-in schedule in subsection (1)c., every secondhand dealer except those exempted by subsection (2), shall, before noon of each day, transmit to the chief of police by means of electronic transmission through a modem or similar device, or by delivery of a computer disk, in such a format that the data are capable of direct electronic entry into the police department's computerized system for identifying and tracing lost, stolen and sought-after property information required by section 25-2. 
b.  The chief of police shall establish the format and requirements for the transmission of data and may restrict the scope of the items that are to be electronically reported. A transaction reported by electronic transmission under subsection (1)a. herein shall not be reported on paper forms unless the chief of police so requests. Each secondhand dealer shall pay to the city a fee of fifty cents ($0.50) per transaction required to be electronically reported if the electronic report transmitted to the chief of police is erroneous, duplicative or in an incorrect or incompatible format, or if no electronic report of the transaction is transmitted. 
c.  Secondhand dealers shall report their transactions electronically to the chief of police as required by subsections (1)a. and b. herein from and after the following dates: 
1.  For each secondhand dealer for which a city privilege license is first obtained on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, effective upon commencing business. 
2.  For each secondhand dealer for which a city privilege license was first obtained before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, that maintains a computerized record-keeping system for its own record of transactions no later than one (1) month after the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. 
3.  For each other second hand dealer for which a city privilege license was first obtained before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, no later than sixty (60) days after the effective date of this section. 
The chief of police may for good cause shown grant a secondhand dealer a reasonable extension of the deadline. An extension may only be granted using the following procedure: The secondhand dealer shall make written request for the extension and shall show that the secondhand dealer is making satisfactory progress toward acquiring computer programs and equipment to make the necessary electronic reporting. The secondhand dealer shall pay to the city a fee of fifty cents ($0.50) per transaction reported after the deadline to comply with the electronic reporting requirements to offset the Opelika Police Department's cost in converting the data from paper format into electronic form. 
(2)  Non-computerized reports. Secondhand dealers need not report electronically transactions taking place at a business location where the number of transactions regarding secondhand goods in any week does not extend ten (10) (calculated from Monday through the next Sunday, inclusive). A secondhand dealer reasonably believing a location at which he or she conducts business qualifies under this subsection for exemption from computerized reporting and wishing to be exempt from the requirement of subsection (1) hereinabove shall sign, under penalty of perjury, a declaration to that effect in a form provided by the chief of police. Once the declaration is signed, so long as the volume of transactions does not exceed ten (10) each week, transactions in secondhand goods need not be reported electronically, but the secondhand dealer must comply in all aspects with section 25-2 and must pay to the city the sum of fifty cents ($0.50) per transaction to offset the police departments costs in converting the data from paper format into electronic form. If, in any two (2) weeks, in any consecutive three-month period, the number of transactions exceeds ten (10) then the secondhand dealer shall cease conducting transactions at that business location until a computerized system is in place and transactions are being reported electronically in compliance with subsection (1) herein. 
(3)  Amendments to reports and formats. If, after establishing the format and requirements for transmission of computerized reports of transactions, the chief of police alters the required format, the secondhand dealers shall be given at least thirty (30) days to comply with the new format requirements. 
(4)  Unlawful to violate this section. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this section. 
(Ord. No. 104-07, § 1, 5-16-07) 
Sec. 25-4. - Purchases to be retained for ten days in original state; exception.

Secs. 26-312-26-324. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XI. - TOWING AND STORAGE OF MOTOR VEHICLES (NONCONSENSUAL TOWING) 

Sec. 26-325. - Findings. 
    The city council has found that some members of the public and their property have been placed at risk in circumstances where their motor vehicles have been towed without their consent and placed in storage because of a variety of factors including, but not limited to, unfair and predatory towing and pricing practices, inadequate notice of when vehicles are subject to towing, unreasonable prices for towing and storage, and lack of adequate recourse in the event of improper towing or storage, among others. Since these activities involve commercial enterprises utilizing city streets and rights-of-way for private profit and based upon the foregoing, the city council has concluded that the regulations provided for by this chapter are required to protect the public health, safety and welfare generally, and particularly the safety of those members of the public whose motor vehicles have been towed without their consent and stored, as well as the public interest in ensuring that the prices charged for nonconsensual tows occurring in instances when motor vehicles are trespassing on private property are fair and reasonable. This article is enacted and adopted pursuant to section 220 of the State of Alabama Constitution of 1901; Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-49-1 and the exemption provided to a political subdivision of the state as set forth in 49 USCA § 14501(c)(2)(C) which grants to such governing authority the right to regulate the price of for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck if such transportation is performed without the prior consent or authorization of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.

1.  A monthly rental charge, which shall be equal to the greater of: 
(i)  Five (5.0) percent of the total estimated cost (including installation costs) of the additional facilities, and 
(ii)  One dollar ($2.00), plus 
2.  An amount, reasonably determined by OPS, reflecting the cost of electric energy, if any, used by the additional facilities. 
b.  The customer may elect to pay the costs of additional facilities, other than energy-related costs, in a single lump-sum payment at the time of their installation, instead of paying a monthly rental charge related to those facilities pursuant to subsection a. above. 
(4)  Taxes. The monthly bills to the customer hereunder shall, in addition to the other amounts set forth herein, include applicable taxes, payments in lieu of taxes, fees, assessments, and surcharges imposed by any governmental authority and governmental fees applicable to service to the customer imposed by any governmental authority.

(Ord. No. 129-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-59. - Power cost adjustment clause, Rate Rider PCA-2016. 
(a)  Applicability. This Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) is applicable to and becomes a part of each retail rate, as defined in each rate schedule, of the Opelika Power Services (OPS) that so specify. 
(b)  General. 
(1)  The PCA reflects the increases/decreases in the cost of wholesale power purchased from OPS's different wholesale power sources. The cost of wholesale power represents a significant portion of the total costs to provide energy to its customers. It is critical that OPS makes sure that it recovers all of its wholesale power costs in its retail sales. 
(2)  Each monthly customer bill under its individual rate schedule, that is defined and subject to the PCA Rate Rider, will be increased/decreased by an amount equal to the result of multiplying the kWh of energy used by the customer by the then-currently applicable PCA determined in the manner set forth herein. 
(c)  Determination of PCA. 
(1)  The PCA hereunder shall be determined and applied monthly using a rolling three-month average. The PCA factor for each month shall be calculated in dollars per kWh. 
(2)  The PCA factor for each month, before adjusting for corrections to reflect actual costs and sales, shall be determined and calculated as follows: 
PCA= PC/TE minus (-) Base 
Where: 
PCA = Power Cost Adjustment factor to be applied to the retail kWh sales to which the PCA-2016 is applicable. It shall be computed to the nearest one-thousandth of a mill per kWh. PC = Total power costs in dollars from all power supply sources for the preceding three-months. This can include any known and measurable increases in costs of power that AMEA reflects in its estimated power costs to OPS. TE = Total energy purchased, measured in kWh, for the preceding three-months from all power supply sources. This total energy will be calculated for the same three-months on which the "PC" the total costs of energy is being calculated. BASE = Base value per kWh that is included in the regular rate tariffs. As last established by the city the base is $0.0588 per kWh. It can be changed and set by the city.  
(3)  The PCA factor for each month determined to the foregoing subsection (2) shall be appropriately adjusted, upward or downward, to allow for differences between the actual power costs and sales. Estimates can change and should be accounted for accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 129-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-60. - Rate stabilization/equalization tariff (RSE Rider). 
(a)  Applicability. This rate stabilization/equalization tariff (RSE rider) is applicable to and becomes a part of each of the electric retail rate schedules of the city. This tariff shall be added to the power cost adjustment rate rider as calculated in section 28-59. 
(b)  General. It is the purpose of this tariff to enable Opelika Power Services (OPS) to lessen the impact, frequency and size of retail rate changes by allowing the city council, who has the authority to regulate an set retail rates for OPS, to adjust its charges more readily in order to meet the annual revenue requirements of OPS and to adjust for fluctuations in annual energy sales volumes. This rate rider is intended to strengthen the credit value and financial status of OPS by allowing it to meet the annual revenue requirements of the system and meet its annual obligation to the city for the opportunity to serve as the utility provider within the territorial limits set for the city. 
By using this "RSE rider" the rates/charges are adjusted to assure that the electric revenues of OPS will always remain adequate to meet the annual revenue requirements of providing electricity to its customers. These annual revenue requirements include operations and maintenance costs, energy and fuel costs, taxes, debt-service costs, payment in lieu of taxes and the annual funds necessary to fund capital costs that are not funded by additional debt. 
By enacting this rate rider, the charges for energy are adjusted (with RSE rider) when and if revenue projections for the upcoming year reflect that the designated revenues from energy sales are not going to be adequate to fund the annual revenue requirements of OPS. Once the rider is set, it will remain in effect for the subsequent three (3) month period, at which time, updated projections for revenue and the need for funding to meet annual revenue requirements will be set by the mayor, controller and director of OPS (collectively the "management committee"). The management committee will be responsible for developing and providing updated revenue projections and the necessary costs of the system needed to meet its annual requirements funding. The management committee shall monitor and review monthly financial statements, balance sheets, statements of income, details concerning revenues and energy sold by customer class, O&M expenses, expenses by functions (e.g. transmission and distribution, administrative and customer service) in order to project revenues and expenditures. Energy demand forecasts shall be based on ten (10) year historic data and the management committee may rely upon forecast models developed by the state municipal electric authority. This rate rider will consist of two components: 
Power Cost Adjustment Rider (currently in effect) 
Rate adjustment needed to fund revenue requirements 
Total "RSE" Rider 
(c)  Determination of tariff. The rate rider adjustment will be calculated by first determining the projected revenue shortfall (PRS). This calculation shall be derived (annual revenue requirements minus the projected revenue from energy sales). The PRS will then be divided by the anticipated and normalized volume of energy (kWh) projected to be sold by OPS for the coming year. This amount of charge shall be rounded to the nearest mill ($0.001) per kWh of energy sold. The monthly customer energy usage (kWh) will be charged this rate rider adjustment as an additional charge to the base retail rates as last approved by the city council. This rate rider adjustment will remain in effect for the following three (3) month period, at which time, the management committee will adjust the RSE rider (if necessary). The city council shall annually review as part of the budget process all rate rider adjustments made by the management committee during the preceding fiscal year and shall review the operating conditions of OPS. This example illustrates how the RSE tariff is calculated:

(d)  Other terms and conditions. This "RSE rider" tariff shall be effective for bills rendered on or after October 1, 2014. Adjustments shall be determined and applied quarterly (October-December; January-March; April-June and July-September). At the end of each fiscal year (9/30) the management of OPS will determine if any (over-recovery) from the RSE rider tariff has occurred for the current year. Any additional recovery of revenue will be used to fund a rate stabilization reserve for OPS. This rate stabilization reserve shall be set aside until it has a balance of not more than seven (7) percent of the annual revenue requirement for OPS. This rate stabilization fund reserve shall not exceed two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000.00) and be encumbered to use for keeping retail rates stable. Once fully funded, the purpose of the rate stabilization reserve will be used to help absorb future retail rate increases. The management committee will decide at what level of this reserve account is needed in order to keep retail rates stable. Should any of these funds be used, the rate stabilization reserve will be refunded back to its maximum level by using the "RSE rider" in future periods.

(1)  Meter. An instrument or apparatus for measuring and recording the quantity or flow of water passing through it. 
(2)  Premises. Any dwelling, apartment, rooming or boarding house, motel, hotel, restaurant, shop, eating, commercial or industrial establishment, place of business, institution or building and all other such dwellings or establishments, whether specifically enumerated herein or not, together with the lot upon which same is situated. 
(3)  Wastewater. A combination of water-carried waste from residences, business buildings, institutions, industrial establishments or other premises, together with such ground, surface and storm waters as may be present. 
(b)  Service charge. A wastewater disposal service charge shall be paid by the owner or tenant of each premises which shall discharge sanitary or industrial wastewater originating from or on such premises into any sanitary sewer served by the sewer system of the city. Said wastewater disposal service charge shall be computed, as herein provided, on the basis of demand, and on the rate of water consumption upon the premises so served by the sewer system of the city. 
(c)  Demand charge. Except as provided herein, a monthly demand charge according to the size of the water meters serving each premises, shall be computed and assessed against each customer discharging effluent from such premises beginning with the October 2011 billing cycle and increasing on the October 2012 billing cycle, as follows: 
Size of Meter (inches) Monthly Demand Charge Effective 
October 1, 2011 Effective 
October 1, 2012 5/8 and 3/4 $13.33 $14.66 1 34.12 37.53 11/2 76.76 84.44 2 136.46 150.11 3 307.04 337.74 4 545.86 600.45 6 1,228.16 1,350.98 8 2,183.40 2,401.74 * The monthly demand charge will increase by 4% beginning with the October 2013 billing cycle.  
(d)  Water consumption charge. Effective October 1, 2011, in addition to the demand charge as computed in subsection (c), a monthly consumption charge, established from the meter readings of the water system serving such premises for the preceding billing period, shall be computed and assessed against each customer discharging effluent from such premises, at the rate of one dollar fifty-four cents ($1.54) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water consumed. Beginning with the October 2012 billing cycle, the monthly consumption charge will increase to one dollar sixty-nine cents ($1.69) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water consumed. Beginning with the October 2013 billing cycle, the monthly consumption charge will increase by four (4) percent. 
(e)  Review of system. The city will review its service charge system annually to determine the wastewater contribution of users, the total cost of the operation and maintenance of the treatment works and the adequacy of its user charge rate. 
(f)  Surcharges. A surcharge shall be applied to all users of the sewer system whose wastewater discharge has total suspended solids (TSS) and/or biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in excess of three hundred (300) parts per million (ppm), and/or nitrogenous loading is greater than one hundred (100) parts per million (ppm) NH3-N concentration determined according to the greater of the two (2) following formulas: 
Surcharge cost per 1,000 gallons = {(B-300)+(S-300)} × Consumption Rate × 0.16 
OR for high nitrogenous oxygen demand sewages: 
Surcharge cost per 1,000 gallons = (N-50) × Consumption Rate × 0.045 
Where: 
B = Average monthly user BOD in ppm, and 
S = Average monthly user TSS in ppm 
N = Average monthly user ammonia (NH3-N) concentration in ppm 
The surcharge cost will be multiplied by the user's metered water consumption (in one thousand (1,000) gallons). The calculated amount will then be added to the charges computed under the city's normal rate schedule to arrive at the user's total monthly bill. 
The discharger shall be responsible for the sampling, testing and reporting the concentration of each discharge to the city's sewer system. Each discharger shall submit a monitoring, testing and quality control plan that meets the city's information needs to ensure accurate measurement of sewer discharges. Discharger shall bear all costs with said sampling, monitoring and testing. The city reserves the right to perform simultaneous testing to verify the accuracy of the dischargers' self-monitoring. The city reserves the right to terminate receipt of material should city testing be materially different from discharger's self-monitoring and self-reporting. 
(g)  Cost for additional expenses. Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants that cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the city's treatment works shall pay the cost of such additional expenses based on the water consumption charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons.

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 109-82, §§ 1-6, adopted Nov. 16, 1982, enacted the provisions codified herein as Div. 5 of Art. IV. Since said ordinance did not expressly amend the Code, the manner of codification has been at editor's discretion. Section 1(1.1) of said ordinance stated that these provisions were supplemental to the provisions of Ord. No. 112-81, included herein as Divs. 1-3 of Art. IV. Consequently, if the provisions of Ord. No. 109-82 and Ord. No. 112-81 should conflict presumably the provisions of Ord. No. 109-82 would control.

These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(a)  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five (5) per cent nor any single reading over ten (10) per cent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(b)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the waste water treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: Grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half (1/2) inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
(c)  Any waste water having a pH less than 5.0, unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such waste water, or waste water having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(d)  Any waste water containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any waste water treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act. 
(e)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(f)  Any substances which may cause the POTW's effluent, or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act, any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.

(h)  Any waste water with objectional color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes, and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(i)  Any waste water having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case waste water with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds forty (40) degrees Celsius (one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit) unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such treatment. 
(j)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five (5) times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operations. 
(k)  Any waste water containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(l)  Any waste water which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
    When the superintendent determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent shall advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW, and develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the interference with the POTW.

(Ord. No. 109-82, § 2(2.6), 11-16-82) 
Sec. 28-191. - Excessive discharge. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. (Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in section 28-185, e.g. the pH prohibition). 
(Ord. No. 109-82, § 2(2.7), 11-16-82) 
Sec. 28-192. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Protection from accidental discharges required. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by July 1, 1983. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this division shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(b)  Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
(c)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

All grease interceptors shall be pumped at a minimum frequency of once for every thirty (30) days, unless an alternate frequency is approved by the director of public works. In no instance shall a variance exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. An approved variance will be null and void if the variance pumping frequency is not adhered to and shall revert to the thirty-day frequency. The city may also mandate more frequent pumping based on inspection results and sewer system capacity. Pumping frequency variances are not transferable. 
(b)  All grease traps and interceptors shall be serviced by a state licensed hauler and a completed manifest shall be kept on site by the originator for every service event. All grease waste shall be taken to a licensed and approved disposal facility for disposal.

(1)  Provide for minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance with the city plumbing code. 
(2)  Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid waste such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc. which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the device. 
(d)  Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating conditions by periodic removal of accumulated grease. No such collected grease shall be introduced into any drainage piping or public or private sewer. 
(Ord. No. 103-12, § 1, 2-21-12)

(Ord. No. 103-12, § 1, 2-21-12) 
Sec. 28-362. - Civil remedies and enforcement. 
(a)  The city council is hereby authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding, including suit for injunctive relief in order to prevent or abate violations of this article.

When service is terminated, deposits may be applied by OPS against any unpaid bills of the customer. If any balance remains after such application is made, said balance shall be refunded to the customer. OPS may require a separate deposit for each customer account. Deposits remain on file until services are disconnected or final billed or the deposit is refunded to the customer. Deposit amounts are as follows: 
Electric Residential Deposit: Based on Experian National Risk Model = $0.00 (Green) Based on Experian National Risk Model = $200.00 (Yellow) Based on Experian National Risk Model = $300.00 (Red) up to two times the preceding twelve month average at the service location Electric Commercial Deposit: $300.00 minimum or two times the estimated high bill at location. If a new service location, the estimated bill will be determined by OPS using load data provided by the customer. The deposit may be reviewed and adjusted after one year of usage. Garbage/Refuse Deposit: Based on Experian National Risk Model = $0.00 (Green) Based on Experian National Risk Model = $25.00 for OPS power customers and $50.00 for non-OPS power customers Telecom Residential Deposit: Based on Experian National Risk Model = $0.00 (Green) Based on Experian National Risk Model = $125.00 (Yellow) or the total of one month's service fees, whichever is higher Based on Experian National Risk Model = $200.00 (Red) or the total of one and half month's service fees, whichever is higher. Credit Scores: Green 685-850 Yellow 630-684 Red 0-629 Note: A yellow flagged customer may have a deposit waived based on past bill payment experience with OPS. If a customer wanting telecom service has no non-sufficient funds or returned checks, they may qualify for no deposit for telecom services. The management of OPS or their designee will make that determination based on a customer's past payment experience and the Experian risk model information. All customers that are flagged yellow will be considered equally when determining their qualification for deposit waiver. Telecom Business Deposit: $250.00 or the total of one month's service fees, whichever is higher.

(Ord. No. 130-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-414. - Billing. 
    Bills will be rendered monthly and shall be paid by the due date or delinquent date specified on the bill. Due dates shall be established at such periods after billing dates as are specified by OPS. The due date shall not be earlier than ten (10) days after the billing date. Due dates cannot be changed. Bills paid after the due date specified on the bill shall be subject to an additional late charge of the greater of five dollars ($5.00) or five (5) percent of the bill amount. Delinquent accounts are subject to review and may result in the requirement of additional deposit. Failure to receive a bill due to mail delivery or other reasons will not release customer from payment obligation. Should the due date of a bill fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day following the due date shall be held as the due date for delivery of payment at OPS' main office or authorized collection agency. Customer shall be obligated for payment of expenses associated with mailing the notice of termination of service, which amounts shall be specified on the notice. Bills shall be paid in lawful United States currency or coin or other acceptable form of payment such as credit card. Customer shall also be obligated to pay OPS an amount established by OPS for expenses incurred by OPS in the processing of checks improperly drawn, not acceptable for processing using normal commercial banking practices, or returned to OPS unpaid by customer's bank. 
(1)  Electric budget billing. OPS offers "budget billing." The system calculates a monthly budget amount for electricity, which is based on the past twelve (12) month's consumption/charge history. The total monthly bill amount will vary slightly each month, as tax and fuel cost are not included in the calculation. Budget bills are re-calculated each December. Budget amounts may increase or decrease based on the customer's consumption for the past twelve (12) months. If an account is terminated from budget billing, deferred balances will be due and payable at that time. Accounts are subject to review prior to being set up for budget billing as certain criteria may apply. 
(2)  Minimum bills. OPS may not disconnect electrical service to any premise for nonpayment of a delinquent bill that is ten dollars ($10.00) or less. Furthermore, a delinquent penalty shall not be added to a delinquent bill unless the amount of the account exceeds ten dollars ($10.00) 
    The director or his designee shall have the right to extend the time of payment of any account in the event of undue hardship. It is the intention of this section that the director shall grant an extension only to overcome some exceptional difficulty that prevents the customer from paying his/her bill by the due date or to avoid a situation that threatens the life or safety of the occupants of any premises served by OPS. All requests for an extension must be submitted to the director prior to the disconnect date. 
(Ord. No. 130-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-415. - Discontinuance of service by OPS for non-payment. 
(a)  At any time after a customer's account has become delinquent, OPS shall give to the customer at least five (5) days' written notice of its intention to discontinue service of his/her account. After the lapse of period specified in the written notice, if the account has not been paid in full, OPS, notwithstanding any deposit referred to in section 28-406, may then discontinue service without further notice subject to the following specific provisions: 
(1)  The customer shall have the right of paying such delinquent account, which shall include any subsequent bill for service which has become delinquent, at any time prior to the actual disconnection of his/her service. 
(2)  Payment by the customer, as set out in subsection (1), at OPS shall not affect OPS' right during the day payment is received to disconnect service for non-payment, if such payment is unknown to employee disconnecting such service. 
(3)  The customer making payment in accordance with subsection (2) will not, in case his/her service is disconnected following payment the same day, be required to pay any reconnection charge. A reconnection charge will apply if OPS has certain knowledge that payment was made following disconnect. 
(4)  No service shall be cutoff for non-payment after 3:30 p.m. on any date immediately preceding a day or days when OPS' business office will be closed. 
(5)  No residential electric service shall be disconnected for non-payment when the temperature at that location is forecasted to be 32° Fahrenheit or below for that calendar day. The controlling forecasted temperature for a particular location shall be the temperature forecasted by the national weather service for that location on the calendar day in question. 
(b)  The notice required in subsection (a) shall have a heading, in bold letters, of "disconnect notice", "termination notice", "final notice" or "cutoff notice". Such notice shall also state the telephone number and address of OPS where the customer may make inquiry about the written notice or any dispute concerning the notice. OPS shall delegate to at least one employee in its customer service office the authority to change any service billing that is in error. 
(c)  OPS shall delegate to at least one employee the power to extend deadline for payment, to enter into agreements to receive the amount of the bill and installments, and to correct errors in bills. This person shall be reasonably available to receive appropriate complaints or inquiries. 
(d)  Whenever service is disconnected for non-payment and the customer requests that service be restored, except as provided in subsection (a)(3), a reconnection fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each respective service shall be added to the customer's delinquent account and shall become due and payable as part of the account for service rendered and shall be paid before service is restored along with all of the amounts owing on the customer's account which were specifically referred to in the delinquent notice, together with all amounts owing on the customer's account which has subsequently become delinquent. 
(e)  Notice of OPS' intention to discontinue service as required in subsection (a) shall be considered to be given to the customer when a copy of such notice is left with such customer, left at the premises where service is rendered, or posted in the United States mail addressed to the customer's last known post office address. If the notice is posted in the United States mail, it shall be delivered to the post office at least five (5) calendar days before service is to be disconnected. 
(f)  OPS may decline to serve an applicant or disconnect a customer who is indebted to OPS for services at a former location or at the present location of the applicant or customer or where such indebtedness was incurred by a member of the applicant's or customer's household, either under the name of the applicant or customer, or another name. Provided, however, applicant shall be served or customer's service shall be continued upon complying with the deposit required in Section 28-406 and in addition thereto making a special deposit in an amount equal to the net balance in dispute. Upon settlement of the disputed account, the balance, if any, due to the applicant or customer or a member of the applicant's or customer's household shall be promptly repaid. 
(g)  Life support. The customer is responsible for notifying OPS, in writing, with letter from the attending physician, if a life-support system is present in the residence to avoid disconnection of service in the event of nonpayment.

(Ord. No. 130-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-417. - Connect, reconnect, and disconnect services and charges. 
    OPS has established and will collect standard charges to cover the reasonable average cost, including administration of connecting service, reconnecting service, or disconnecting service. Higher charges may be established and collected when connections and/or reconnections are performed after normal office hours, or when special circumstances warrant. When connecting service, a connection fee of forty dollars ($40.00) will be assessed and is non-refundable. A request for transfer of service must be made in person at OPS customer service center, located at 600 Fox Run Parkway. Proof of identification is required. All previous account balances must be paid in full prior to transferring service. Requirements to update the customer's electric and/or refuse deposit may exist. A twenty -five dollar ($25.00) fee is required for electric and refuse service transfer. This fee is not billable and is non-refundable. 
    Request for service disconnection may be initiated by calling OPS' customer service center at 334-705-5170. Information verification is required. Deposits will be applied to any outstanding account balance. Statements will be mailed approximately seven (7) to ten (10) days after termination of service. Refund checks are mailed independently of statements. A service call fee of eighty dollars ($80.00) will be assessed for problems beyond OPS' control and not within its responsibilities or if the service call was unwarranted in the judgment of OPS. OPS does not reconnect service after hours except in emergency situations. If service is reconnected after 4:30 p.m., or on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, an after hour service charge of one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00) will be required. Accounts will be scheduled for disconnection of service five (5) days after the delinquent date. A fifty dollar ($50.00) non-payment (delinquent) fee will be assessed at that time. Accounts may be assessed a non-payment fee without being disconnected.

Accounts scheduled for disconnection are subject to review; a deposit increase may be required. 
(Ord. No. 130-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-418. - Administrative hearing prior to termination of service. 
    At any time prior to 4:30 p.m. on the day preceding the disconnect date, any customer may request in writing an administrative hearing before the director or his designee. No hearing shall be necessary if the customer does not request a hearing in writing. Upon such request, the director or his designee shall, as soon as practicable, fix a day and time for the administrative hearing. In any event, all disputes shall be heard by the director or his designee before the customer's service is disconnected. The hearing shall offer the customer reasonable opportunity to be heard on any dispute concerning the amount of his/her bill or any other matter relating to the termination of the customer's service. The customer may appear at the hearing in person or through a designated representative. The final decision of the director or his designee shall be made in writing and a copy of the decision shall be delivered to the customer either personally or by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. If the director or his designee's decision shall be to terminate the customer's service, the date of termination shall be stated therein.

Sec. 28-419. - Termination of contract by customer. 
    Customers who have fulfilled their contract terms and wish to discontinue service must give at least three (3) days written notice to that effect, unless the customer's contract specifies otherwise. A Customer's notice to discontinue service prior to expiration of the customer's contract term will not relieve customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under any contract or rate schedule. 
(Ord. No. 130-15, § 1, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 28-420. - Service charges for temporary service.

Sec. 28-421. - Irregular service. 
    It is recognized by the parties that the availability of power to a customer may be interrupted or curtailed from time to time because of an "act of God", acts by agents or employees of OPS constituting negligence, or otherwise. Because the customer is in the best position to provide and install special wiring, alternate supplies, or special devices to protect customer facilities and equipment, the customer assumes all risk of loss, injury or damage resulting from such interruptions or curtailments. OPS will use reasonable diligence to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or telecom services, but shall not be liable for any loss, injury, or property damage resulting from failure to supply electricity and/or telecom services, interruption, delay in restoration, mechanical failure, single-phasing, voltage irregularity, fire, labor difficulties, riot, explosion, breakdown, external forces, flood, acts of God, or the public enemy. 
    OPS shall not be liable for any damage where customer's wiring does not conform to applicable code or law.

Sec. 28-461. - Provisions of equipment and facilities. 
    OPS' facilities and service may be used with or terminated in customer-provided terminal equipment or customer-provided communications systems, such as a PBX, key systems or pay telephone. Such terminal equipment shall be furnished and maintained at the expense of the customer, except as otherwise provided. The customer is responsible for all cost at his or her premises, including personnel, wiring, electrical power, and the like, incurred in the use of OPS' service. The customer is responsible for ensuring that customer-provided equipment connected to OPS equipment and facilities is compatible with such equipment and facilities. 
    OPS shall use reasonable efforts to maintain only the facilities and equipment that it furnishes to the customer. The customer may not, nor may the customer permit others to, rearrange, disconnect, remove, and attempt to repair, or otherwise interfere with any of the facilities or equipment installed by OPS, except upon the written consent of OPS.

    Equipment OPS provides or installs at the customer's premises for use in connection with the services OPS offers shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which it was provided by OPS.

Where such equipment is connected to the facilities furnished pursuant to this document, the responsibility of OPS shall be limited to the furnishing of facilities offered under this document and to the maintenance and operation of such facilities. 
(Ord. No. 118-13, § 2, 10-15-13) 
Sec. 28-462. - Shortage of equipment or facilities. 
    OPS reserves the right to limit or to allocate the use of existing facilities, or of additional facilities offered by OPS, when necessary because of lack of facilities, or due to some other cause beyond OPS' control.

(Ord. No. 118-13, § 2, 10-15-13) 
Sec. 28-463. - Customer equipment and channels. 
    A user may transmit or receive information or signals via the facilities of OPS. OPS' services are designed primarily for the transmission of voice-grade telephonic signals, except as otherwise stated in this document.

(Ord. No. 118-13, § 2, 10-15-13) 
Sec. 28-465. - Access to telephone relay services. 
    OPS will make all reasonable attempts to participate in telephone relay service for handicapped and/or hearing-impaired customers and will comply with all regulations and requirements.

(Ord. No. 118-13, § 2, 10-15-13) 
Sec. 28-466. - Universal emergency telephone number service (911, E911). 
    This document does not provide for the inspection or constant monitoring of facilities to discover errors, defects, or malfunctions in the service, nor does OPS undertake such responsibility. 
    The 911 calling party, by dialing 911, waives the privacy afforded by non-listed and non-published service to the extent that the telephone number, name, and address associated with the originating station location are furnished to the public safety answering point. 
    After the establishment of service, it is the public safety agency's responsibility to continue to verify the accuracy of and to advise OPS of any changes as they occur in street names, establishment of new streets, changes in address numbers used on existing streets, closing and abandonment of streets, changes in police, fire, ambulance or other appropriate agencies' jurisdiction over any address, annexations and other changes in municipal an county boundaries, incorporation of new cities or any other similar matter that may affect the routing of 911 calls to the proper public safety answering point. 
    OPS assumes no liability for any infringement, or invasion of any right to privacy of any person or persons caused, or claimed to be caused, directly or indirectly by the use of 911 service. Under the terms of this document, the public safety agency must agree, (except where the events, incidents, or eventualities set forth in this sentence are the result of OPS' gross negligence or willful misconduct), to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless OPS from any and all loses or claims whatsoever, whether suffered, made, instituted, or asserted by the public safety agency or by any other party or person, for any personal injury to or death of any person or persons, or for any loss, damage, or destruction of any property, whether owned by the customer or others. Under the terms of this document, the public safety agency must also agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless OPS for any infringement of invasion of the right to privacy of any person or persons, caused or claimed to have been caused, directly or indirectly, by the installation, operation, failure to operate, maintenance, removal, presence, condition, occasion, or use of 911 service features furnished by OPS in connection therewith, including, but not limited to, the identification of the telephone number, address, or name associated with the telephone used by the party or parties accessing 911 services hereunder, and which arise out of the negligence or other wrongful act of the public safety agency, its user, agencies or municipalities, or the employees or agents of any one of them, or which arise out of the negligence, other than gross negligence or willful misconduct, of OPS, its employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 118-13, § 2, 10-15-13) 
Sec. 28-467. - Directory listings. 
    OPS does not publish a directory of customer listings. OPS, however, does arrange for the customer's main billing number to be placed in the directory of directories of the dominant local exchange carrier. 
    The rates and regulations specified herein for directory listings apply only to the alphabetical section of the directory. Listings are intended solely for the purpose of identifying customer's telephone number and as an aid to the use of telephone service. 
    The listings of customers either without or with charge for other listings are arranged alphabetically and are not intended for special prominence of arrangement. In accepting listings as requested by customers or prospective customers, OPS will not be a party to controversies between customers as result of the publication of such listings in the directories. 
    Listings must conform to OPS' specifications with respect to the directories. OPS reserves the right to reject listings which in, its sole judgment, such listings would violate the integrity of OPS records and the directories, confuse individuals using the directory, or when the customer cannot provide satisfactory evidence that he or she is authorized to do business as requested. 
    OPS reserves the right to limit the length of any listing to one line in the directory by use of abbreviations when, in its sole judgment, the clearness of the listing and the identification of the customer is not impaired. 
    Generally, the listed address is the location of the customer's place of business or residence. 
    OPS has no liability to the customer or any other entity for directory listing errors, omissions or mistakes. OPS will make all reasonable efforts to ensure accurate listings but assumes no liability, financially or otherwise. 
    Generally, a business listing consists of a name or dual name, a designation descriptive of the customer's business if not self-explanatory, the address, and business telephone number. The main listing is ordinarily the name of the individual, firm or corporation which contracts for the service or the name under which a business is regularly conducted. All customers will receive one free directory listing. There will be a monthly fee for each additional listing.

SECTION I
AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
SECTION 1.1 AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION1
In pursuance of the authority granted by Title 11, Article 2, Chapter 52, Sections 30-36, inclusive, of the 1975 Code of Alabama, the Planning Commission of the City of Opelika hereby adopts the following rules and regulations to regulate the subdivision of land lying within the corporate limits of the City of Opelika and all land lying within three (3)2 miles of the corporate limits.
These rules and regulations supercede all subdivision regulations heretofore adopted by the Opelika Planning Commission.
These regulations shall govern all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Opelika and extending to three (3)2 miles beyond the city limits of Opelika, as now or hereafter established.
Any owner of land within the limits of said subdivision jurisdiction wishing to subdivide land, shall submit to the Planning Commission a plat of the subdivision which shall conform to the maximum requirements set forth in Article III of these regulations. No plat of a subdivision lying within such territory or part thereof, shall be filed or recorded in the Office of the Judge of Probate and no sub-divider shall proceed with improvement or sale of land until a plat of said subdivision has been first submitted to the Opelika Planning Commission and its approval noted thereon in writing by the Chairman of the Planning Commission. (See Article IV Approval of Plats)
SECTION 1.2 PENALITES
Any person violating any provision of this ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) and by imprisonment in the city jail for not more than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense; in addition, no utilities shall be connected, no building permit, certificate of occupancy, or equivalent shall be issued until such time as the subdivision has been given such formal approval by the Planning Commission and legally recorded in the office of the Probate Judge.
The City of Opelika may enjoin any such transfer, or sale, or agreement, by action for injunction brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, or may recover the same penalty by civil fine in any court of competent jurisdiction.
1Date of Amendment: May 27, 2008 Res. No. 01-08 Increase PJ from 3 miles to 5 miles.

Subdivision Regulation, Section III: General Requirements & Minimum Standards of Design for the Subdivision of
Land, July 27, 2004
3
SECTION III
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
FOR THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND
SECTION 3.1 EXCEPTION
The following planning and design standards shall be complied with no higher standard may be required by the Planning Commission except where because of exceptional and unique conditions of topography, location, shape, size drainage or other physical features of the site, or where minimum standards specified herein would not reasonably protect or provide for public health, safety, and welfare. Any higher standard required shall be reasonable and shall be limited to the minimum additional improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
SECTION 3.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. Conformity to the Elements of the Opelika Comprehensive Plan
All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the City Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, and to all elements of the citys Comprehensive Plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any thoroughfare or part thereof designated on the Comprehensive (Major Thoroughfare) Plan, such part of such proposed public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the same location and at the same width as indicated on such city plan.
SECTION 3.3 STREET LAYOUT
A. General Requirements
The arrangement, character, extent width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and Public Works Manual and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Relation to Adjoining Streets System
When proposed new streets shall extend existing streets or their projections, the widths of the new streets shall be approved by the Planning Commission, but in no case shall the streets be less than the minimum required width, unless variations may be deemed necessary by the Planning Commission for reasons of topography or design. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining property, for public convenience and safety proposed streets shall extend to the boundary of such property.
Subdivision Regulation, Section III: General Requirements & Minimum Standards of Design for the Subdivision of
Land, July 27, 2004
4
C. Alleys
Alleys shall be provided along the rear or side of all lots as required for public health safety and/or welfare. Provision for alleys is optional except where such alleys are advisable to provide for adequate access for municipal services, or utilities. Alley intersections and alignment geometries shall be consistent with requirements established in the Public Works Manual.
D. Street Improvements
Street Improvements shall be required as set for in the Public Works Manual.
E. Sidewalks
Sidewalks shall be provided consistent with requirements established in the Public Works Manual. Sidewalks will be required where considered necessary for public health safety and welfare.
SECTION 3.4 BLOCKS
A. General Requirements
The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs to the type of use contemplated.
2. Zoning Ordinance and Health Department requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
3. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitation due to topography.
B. Size, Shape, and Arrangement
Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet no more than twelve hundred (1200) feet in length measured from centerline to centerline, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street pattern. Block length is considered to be the long axis of the block. Blocks greater than twelve hundred (1200) feet in length shall not adversely affect public health, safety and welfare.
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) rows or tiers of lots except where reverse frontage on a major street is provided or where prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property; in which case the Planning Commission may approve a single row or tier of lots of minimum depths.
Subdivision Regulation, Section III: General Requirements & Minimum Standards of Design for the Subdivision of
Land, July 27, 2004
5
SECTION 3.5 LOTS
A. General Requirements
All building lots platted and developed in flood hazard areas in the City of Opelika will comply with applicable provisions of the Opelika Zoning Ordinance and all subsequent amendments and provide all data required in the Ordinance. Development in flood hazard areas outside the city limits of Opelika but within the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission shall be consistent with ordinances and regulations established by Lee County, Alabama.
B. Size, Shape, and Arrangement
The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed subdivision, and for the type of development contemplated, and shall conform to the following:
1. Every lot shall have access to a public street. Minimum lot frontage at the street right-of-way shall be as approved by the Planning Commission to assure adequate access for health, safety and welfare.
a. Within the city limits minimum lot dimensions must meet the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and/or the requirements of the County Health Department as reflected by percolation test data. In such cases where requirements may conflict, the larger requirements shall conflict, the larger requirement shall govern.
b. Within the subdivision jurisdiction limits of the Planning Commission beyond the City Limits, the size and shape of lots shall be such as the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of use contemplated and/or requirements of the County Health Department. As a minimum, R-2 standard shall apply.
c. Where frontage is provided for access only, a minimum width of sixty (60) feet shall extend for the total length of access, except for the provisions applying to flag lots.
2. Double frontage and reverse frontage residential lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or so as to overcome specific disadvantages of topography orientation. The subdivider shall provide a Planting Screen Buffer Easement of not less than ten (10) feet in width, along the line of lots abutting such an artery or other undesirable features.
Subdivision Regulation, Section III: General Requirements & Minimum Standards of Design for the Subdivision of
Land, July 27, 2004
6
3. Corner lots shall be large enough to allow houses to conform to building lines on both the front and side streets except where the Planning Commission specifically permits waiver of the requirement.
4. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to curved street 1 lines on which the lot faces.
5. Flag lots shall be permitted when they meet the following conditions.
a. Where the flag lot makes it possible to better utilize irregularly shaped properties or areas with resource limitations.
b. The pole portion of a flag lot shall not be included as part of the lot area for the purpose of determining average lot area and the pole shall have a minimum width on a public street right-of-way of not less than thirty (30) feet.
c. Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of lots taking access to a collector or arterial road. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the development costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots; even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads.
d. Minimum lot area for flag lots shall be at least twice that of the zoning district in which the flag lot is located.
e. Side and rear yard requirements shall be met on the lot excluding the pole portion of the lot.
f. The maximum length of the pole portion of the lot shall be no more than three times the lot width measured where the lot abuts the rear of the lot(s) between it and the street. This may be greater in the Agricultural Zones or in the Planning Jurisdiction outside the city limits.
g. City services shall be provided at the public road right-of-way.
h. A minimum frontage of 30 feet shall apply to lots which front upon the turn around portion of a cul-de-sac.
Subdivision Regulation, Section III: General Requirements & Minimum Standards of Design for the Subdivision of
Land, July 27, 2004

SECTION 3.6 PUBLIC USE, NATURAL FEATURES AND EASEMENTS
A. Public Use
Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of suitable areas for parks and play around and open space consistent with the Comprehensive Plan to be acquired for public use by the city.
B. Natural Features
Due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historic spots, and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property.
C. Reserved Areas
There shall be no reserved areas for public use except those which are conveyed to or accepted by the government having jurisdiction.
D. Easements
1. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and their width shall be as required by the proposed utility and/or Public Works Manual.
2. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream or if such a proposed drainage way is reflected in an adopted drainage plan, there shall be provided a storm water drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such drainage. The easement or right-of-way shall be sufficient to contain the ultimate channel and maintenance way for the tributary area upstream.

Best Management Practice  BMPs
Development plans for the construction of buildings and/or streets shall incorporate Best Management Practices as recommended by ADEM and as provided in the City of Opelikas erosion and sediment control ordinance (Ord. #116-02) in order to minimize impervious surface areas, direct storm-water away from surface waters, and minimize water quality impacts. Animal operations greater than 100 animal units shall also employ Best Management Practices as recommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.
Exceptions to Applicability.
Existing developments, as defined in these regulations, are not subject to these requirements. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet these requirements, however, if a new development is proposed on a parcel that has existing development, then the impervious surface area calculations of the new development.
Cluster Development.
Clustering of development is allowed in all Watershed Areas under the following conditions:
a. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster development projects. The total number of lots may exceed density allowed for multi-family developments in the underlying zoning district with approval. Refer to section 7.3 in the Opelika Zoning Ordinance.
b. Impervious Surface area or storm water control requirements of the project shall not exceed that allowed by these regulations or the watershed area in which the project is located.

B. Improvements3,4
If desired by the subdivider, the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at the time; all of this provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
Final Approval of a subdivision by the Planning Commission is required prior to the recording of the plat in the Office of the Probate Judge. It is not legal to "transfer or sell" any land in said subdivision until the Plat is recorded.
No building permit or Certificate of Occupancy will be issued until such time as the subdivision has been given final approval, with signatures as required below [D. Final Plat requirement] and recorded.
1. After infrastructure improvements (street, street name signs4, curb & gutter, sanitary sewer, water, storm drain system) are installed, constructed and completed prior to recording of the final plat, the City Engineer and Public Works Director5 must certify that all streets shown on the plat have been graded and improved, except for the final asphalt wearing surface, and that the sanitary sewer system, water lines, and storm water facilities have been installed, tested, and are functioning according to the City or utility provider specifications and the approved construction plans.
The conduit for all utilities (water, power, sewer, gas, telephone, cable) crossing roadbeds of new streets shall be installed before the final plat is recorded. (See Section 26-69, Work in the Public Right-of-way in the Code of Ordinances  City of Opelika, Alabama.) The developer shall use property pins as reference points to locate the conduit across roadbeds and the rights-of-way. Unless otherwise directed by the appropriate utility company, the developer shall be responsible for digging the trench, installing conduit, and backfilling for the purpose of installing road crossings, in accordance to the utilitys design drawing and specifications. All conduits shall be plugged and stringed. If the utility company encounters obstructions which prevent the utility line from being pulled, the developer will be required to correct the conduit system. The developer shall use conduit material per utility provider specifications. The monitoring and installation of conduit will be subject to inspection and written approval by the appropriate utility company. The appropriate utility company reserves the right to require the developer to suspend work in the event the utility has any concerns with the construction or installation. In the event the conduit system is covered prior to inspection or deviates significantly from the approved utility design drawing, the appropriate utility may require that the conduit system be uncovered as necessary to determine that the conduit was constructed and installed according to the utility design drawings or

Zoning Ordinance, Section I: Short Title, September 17, 1991
1
SECTION I
SHORT TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known as the "Zoning Ordinance" and the map herein referred to identified by the title "Zoning Map of Opelika" and attested to by the City Clerk. The Zoning Map of Opelika and all explanatory matter thereon is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. Such map shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk and shall show thereon the date of adoption of this ordinance.
SECTION 1.1 INTENT
This ordinance has been designed to protect and accommodate competing interests in the use, enjoyment and development of land within the City of Opelika. Every possible consideration has been given to the public interest, individual property rights and the impacts, or externalities, associated with the development of land in Opelika. It is the goal of this ordinance that both the burdens and the benefits it implies be rationally and fairly distributed among the citizens and property owners of Opelika.
Changes in zoning (rezoning) may appear to reduce the certainty of protection to owners of neighboring property and to increase the potential for adverse impacts to the City of Opelika. This ordinance contains standards and procedures intended to insure that neighbors, the citizenry-at-large, and the City of Opelika are protected from adverse impacts; and that the community's general welfare is protected and enhanced. Distinctions between zoning districts are significant and are based on the policies contained in the Opelika Comprehensive Plan. The districts are sized and located to meet the needs in Opelika for preservation of stable, existing development; for improvement of declining and transitional areas; and to encourage and promote growth and long-term economic stability. This ordinance contains clear, detailed procedures for the justified change of zoning district designations, in accordance with the Opelika Comprehensive Plan, as time passes.
SECTION 1.2 PURPOSE
The purpose of the ordinance is the implementation of the Opelika Comprehensive Plan, and the promotion of the health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the City of Opelika. Specifically, it is the purpose of this ordinance to preserve and maintain a healthful environment by providing standards and procedures to control the density of development, to control the intensity of development in areas of sensitive natural resources, and to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts. Further, it is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residences and other uses, and to establish standards so that all the people of the City of Opelika may have access to decent, sound, sanitary and safe housing. Finally, it is the express purpose of this ordinance to lessen the danger of congestion of traffic on the streets, roads and highways of the city; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to provide adequate privacy, light and air, to protect the tax base by facilitating cost effective development
Zoning Ordinance, Section I: Short Title, September 17, 1991

within the city; to secure economy in local government expenditures; to protect landowners from adverse impacts of adjoining developments; and to divide the incorporated areas of the City of Opelika into districts according to the use of land and buildings, the density of development, the intensity of such use and development (including height and bulk), and the provision of adequate open space.

SECTION 4.2 POWERS
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this chapter, to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, the enforcement or the provisions of this chapter would result in unwarranted hardship and injustice, but which will most nearly accomplish the purpose and intent of this chapter, to hear and decide on applications for interpretation of the Zoning District Map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary.
A. Variances. The Board shall have the power to grant the following variances:
1. A variation in the yard requirements in any district so as to relieve practical difficulties or particular hardships in cases when and where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of such regulation or restriction, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of such regulation or restriction would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional hardship upon the owner of such property. Such grant of variance shall comply as nearly as possible in every respect with the spirit, intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, it being the purpose of this provision to authorize the granting of a variation only for reasons of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations sought by applicants for purposes or reasons of convenience, profit or caprice.
2. No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds: That the strict application of this ordinance would produce unwarranted hardship; or practical difficulty that such hardship or difficulty is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; that the authorization of such variances will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited in a given district.
Zoning Ordinance, Section IV: Zoning Board of Adjustment, Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities, September
17, 1991

3. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this chapter.
4. Whenever an application for a variance cancels or withdraws his application after an advertisement for a public hearing has been published, any rescheduling for a public hearing on said application or reapplication for the same variance shall be more than four (4) months after the original public hearing was scheduled.
5. The procedure for amendment of a special exception or variance already approved, or a request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for a new application, except that where the Zoning Administrator determines the change to be minor relative to the original approval, he may transmit the same to the Board with the original record without requiring that a new application be filed.
B. Interpretation of District Boundaries.
Application for interpretation of district boundaries may be made by any property owner, agent, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau to the City Planner on the forms provided therefore and in accordance with rules adopted by the Board.

SECTION 4.4 APPEALS
Appeal to the Board of Adjustment and to the Courts. It is the intent of the governing authority of the City that all questions of interpretation and enforcement of this ordinance shall be presented first to the Zoning Administrator. Other than those applications and matters upon which the terms and provisions of this ordinance may require action and decision by the said Board of Adjustment, only the appeals taken in the manner and form as provided in this ordinance from the actions and decisions of the Zoning Administrator will be considered and acted upon by the said Board of Zoning Adjustment.

(14 CFR Part 77), as may be amended from time to time.
1. A proposed development shall be determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" if the proposed development would result in a structure or natural vegetation having a height greater than an imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends and sides of a public use airport active runway at a slope of one (1) foot vertical to one hundred (100) feet horizontal outward to twenty thousand (20,000) feet for Subzone A or two hundred (200) feet above ground level for Subzone B. Applicants of any development proposal determined by the City to result in a structure(s) that constitutes a "potential airport obstruction" shall be issued a notice of potential airport obstruction during the development proposal review process by the Planning Director or his designee.
a. No proposal for development will be approved for construction and no permit for construction will be issued for any proposal to construct any structure which is determined by the City to be a "potential airport obstruction" unless a city airport construction permit is granted.
2. Any proposed development which is not determined to be a "potential airport obstruction" is exempt from any airport height notification zone permitting regulations contained herein.
3. Airport construction permit procedures and criteria for approval. Any applicant affected by a notice of potential obstruction may apply to the Planning Director for an airport construction permit.
a. Procedures for obtaining an airport construction permit.
i. Applicants shall submit to the Planning Department a completed airport construction permit application form (as provided by the City) and a copy of the notice of proposed construction form submitted to the FAA for the project. Permit requests may be considered by the Planning Director concurrent with development plan approval consideration.
ii. Prior to permit requests being considered for approval, applicants shall submit to the Planning Department the final determination issued by the FAA based on its review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction submitted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 77.
b. Criteria for granting an airport construction permit.
i. Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would not exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the Planning Director shall grant an airport construction permit for the proposed development provided that a condition is attached to the permit approval to ensure that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (C.O.) if so required by Chapter 14-60, in
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
52
accordance with the standards of Rules of the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, as amended.
ii. Where the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined that the proposed development exceeds the obstruction standards of 14 CFR Part 77, no airport construction permit may be approved, and a City airport obstruction variance must be obtained by the applicant for the proposed development to proceed.
4. A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of these regulations or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
7.4.07 Airport Runway Protection Zone and Regulations.
A. Zone establishment.
There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map a runway protection zone for areas at each end of every active runway as may be amended from time to time. Within a runway protection zone, certain uses are restricted or prohibited to reduce incompatibilities with normal airport operations and danger to public health.

7.4.08 Airport Noise Impact Zone and Regulations.
A. Zone establishment.
There is hereby created and established as an overlay zone on the adopted City zoning map an airport noise impact zone for areas surrounding airport. The airport noise impact zone is an area in which special construction standards are recommended for new construction and alteration, moving and repair to minimize the impact of airport generated noise routinely produced by continuation of normal airport operations. The airport noise impact zone is defined as follows:
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
53
1. An area contiguous to the airport measuring one-half (½) the length of the longest planned runway on either side of and at the end of each runway centerline. For land use control purposes, this boundary shall be considered to be consistent with the sixty-five (65) to seventy (70) level day night (ldn) zone determined by an official Part 150 Noise Study or other recognized study, such as an Environmental Assessment, if a study is completed.
B. Noise impact zone regulations.
Provisions of this section shall apply to construction, alteration, moving, repair and use of any building or structure within the airport noise impact zone.
1. Applicants for building permits or permits granted by the Planning Department in the noise impact zone shall be provided information at the time of application regarding recommended amounts of noise level reduction (NLR) in the airport noise impact zone as established by this Ordinance as well as guidelines for how such noise reduction shall be achieved.
7.4.09 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Regulations not Retroactive.
These airport regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date of this chapter or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nonconforming vegetation is subject to removal per the provisions of § 7.4.
B. Marking and Lighting.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to install, operate, and maintain thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport, Federal Aviation Administration, or State of Alabama, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such obstructions in accordance with FAA requirements. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the owners expense.
C. Expansion of a Nonconforming Use.
Any existing nonconforming use as described in these regulations shall not be expanded by altering, replanting or otherwise enlarging it so as to increase in any way its hazard within the airspace required for flight of aircraft in landing or taking-off or to increase the potential hazard to persons assembled within a structure so located and used.
7.4.10 Permits.
A. An applicant seeking development approval in an area within the airport overlay zones shall provide the following information in addition to any other information required in the permit application:
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007

Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500, and by imprisonment in the City jail for not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment and also costs of court for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense (Section 3.4 Penalties).
Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the City of Opelika Planning Department upon a form published for this purpose. Applications submitted to the Planning Department shall be promptly considered and approved or denied. Applications for variances by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be transmitted by the Planning Director.
7.4.12 Special Requirements.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no use within the City of Opelika shall interfere with any operation of an airborne aircraft using a public use airport. The following special requirements shall apply to proposed developments or land use practices that attract or sustain hazardous wildlife populations on or near airports that can significantly increase the potential for wildlife-aircraft collisions.
1. The distance between the Airports aircraft movement areas, loading ramps or aircraft parking areas and the wildlife attractant should be a distance of 10,000 feet. A distance of 5 statute miles is recommended, if the wildlife attractant may cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. For additional information please consult with the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration for standard practices for locating certain land uses having the potential to attract hazardous wildlife to or in the vicinity of public use airports.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
55
2. Sludge disposal, effluent spraying, compost activities and any other waste disposa1 activities should normally not be allowed within the property limits of the Airport.
3. Disposal sites for putrescible material, i.e. garbage dumps, landfills, and other similarly licensed or titled facilities, are to be considered incompatible when located within 10,000 feet of the Airports runways.
4. Disposal sites for nonputrescible material, e.g. construction demolition waste, automobile junk yards, kitchen appliances, and incinerator ash residue, are normally considered incompatible to within 10,000 feet of a runway used by turbine powered aircraft. However, depending upon the specific proposal, the results of a site investigation, and the proposed location relative to the runway approach/departure paths, certain types of restricted nonputrescible disposal operations may be found non-objectionable off airport, provided assurances are obtained from the proponent, and included in the licensing process, that should the site cause an increase in bird activity which might be hazardous to safe aircraft operations, action will be taken to mitigate the hazard or close the site.
5. Proposed developments which produce lights or illumination, smoke, glare or other visual hazards, or produce electronic interference with airport/airplane navigation signals are subject to the standards specified in the FAA Procedures Manual 7400-2C as may be applied and enforced by the state and/or federal governments.
6. Vegetation in the airport north-south approach zone or the airport northwest-southeast approach zone must be removed if said vegetation penetrates the approach surfaces.
7.4.13 Standards for Variances Applicable to the Airport.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations of this Section may apply to the Opelika Board of Zoning Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Applications for variances shall follow the same procedure for other variances (See Section 4.1 Procedures). The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airport as to the effect of the requested variance on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.
A. Criteria for granting an airport obstruction variance.
Where the FAA has reviewed the proposed development and determined its construction would exceed an obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77, the board of adjustment may grant an airport obstruction variance for a proposed development. Such a variance may be granted if the board determines that:
1. The literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and where the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest (i.e. the development can be accommodated in navigable airspace without adverse impact to surrounding environs).
2. Granting the variance will not create a hazard to air navigation.
3. Granting the variance will do substantial justice.
4. The variance will be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations.
ALL VARIANCES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS AND TERMS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE FAA.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
56
B. The following requirements must also be met for an airport obstruction variance to be approved:
1. A condition must be attached to the variance approval to require that the approved structure(s) is marked and lighted to indicate to aircraft pilots the presence of an obstruction in accordance with the standards of FAA Advisory Circular Number 70/7460-1K, as it may be amended. Where such marking or lighting is required, such requirement shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy (C.O.) for the affected structure.
2. The FAA must determine the aeronautical evaluations submitted are valid.
3. Consideration shall be given to:
a. The nature of the terrain and height (height per § 512.02) of existing structures.
b. Public and private interests and investments.
c. The character of flying operations and planned development of airports.
d. FAA designated federal airways.
e. Whether construction of the proposed structure would cause an increase in the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport.
f. Technological advances.
g. The safety of persons on the ground and in the air.
h. Land use density.
i. The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.
j. The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing structures or proposed structures identified in the City of Opelika.
k. FAA determinations and results of aeronautical studies conducted by or for the FAA.
l. Comments and recommendations from the Airport.
m. Other testimony and findings of aviation operations and safety experts.
7.4.14 Obstruction Marking and Lighting.
Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of these regulations and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit at the owners expense, to install, operate and maintain hereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard.1

SECTION 7.5 FLOOD PLAIN DEVELOPMENT2
Ordinance No. 106-11 adopted by the Opelika City Council on April 5, 2011, known as the City of Opelika Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance shall overlay and supplement the regulation of the City of Opelika Zoning Ordinance, and shall be considered part of the Zoning Ordinance for purposes of administration and appeals under state law. If any provision of Ordinance No. 106-11 differs or is in conflict with any provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the provision imposing the greater restriction or more stringent standard shall be controlling.
The regulations in Ordinance No. 106-11 shall apply to all lands identified as special flood hazard area by Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated January 27, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. For those land areas acquired by the City through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Lee County are adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by government agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. These special flood hazard areas (sometimes referred to and designated as Flood Plain Overlay Districts in the Zoning Ordinance) are declared to be part of the Zoning Ordinance and are hereby incorporated by reference. A Development Permit shall be required in accordance with the provisions of Ordinance No. 106-11 PRIOR to the commencement of any Development activities. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of Ordinance No. 106-11 and other applicable regulations.

SECTION 7.6 GATEWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT3
This section authorizes the establishment of Gateway Corridor Overlay Districts. The intent of this section is to specify those areas that serve as a primary means of entry into Opelika and name those areas the Gateway Corridor Overlay District. The district is designated to be an overlay appended to residential, commercial, industrial or any other districts. The Gateway Overlay District is similar to airport hazard areas (Section 7.4) and the Flood Plain Overlay District (see Section 7.5) in that additional regulation will apply and supersede the underlying district regulations. In other words, a Gateway Overlay District can be placed on top of any of the Citys existing zoning districts creating an overlap in the zoning along a specified length of roadway desired to be regulated. Any proposed development, then, would have to meet the zoning requirements of both the existing zone and the Gateway Overlay district. The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall include roadway corridors and their adjacent development located in several use districts. Uses typically include retail, wholesale, motel, recreation, office, fast-food establishments, and similar uses. This district is characterized by special design controls enforced to prevent incompatible uses and to maintain an attractive gateway or entrance into Opelika. The design of these corridors and their major elements shall reflect the identity and image of the entire City of Opelika.
The Gateway Corridors are divided into two subdivisions based on the development pattern that the streets were originally constructed under.
Gateway Corridor - Primary Overlay District
Those corridors which were developed under more modern and suburban development patterns and to specifically accommodate automobiles are designated Gateway Corridor  Primary (GC-P). These corridors typically have larger lots with ample parking and buildings setback further from the public right-of-way.
Gateway Corridor - Secondary Overlay District
The corridors found in older sections of the City of Opelika and retro-fitted to accommodate automobiles area designated Gateway Corridor-Secondary (GC-S). These corridors feature smaller, more standardized lots. The structures on these lots are often smaller and located at varying positions on the lot based on the timeframe in which they were built. Newer buildings are often setback further while, older buildings are usually closer to the right-of-way.
The Gateway Corridor districts are designated as shown on the official City of Opelika Zoning Map
The GC-P shall extend 150 feet from the outside edge of both sides of the right-of-way from the following street segments:

The Gateway Corridors are subject to the GC district regulations in the matrix table in Section 7.3A. The Gateway Corridor Overlay District is supplemental to the underlying zoning district classifications. The Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall be imposed in addition to said underlying zoning regulations. In any case where the standards and requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District conflict with those of the underlying zoning district, the standards and requirements of the Gateway Corridor Overlay District shall govern, unless specifically noted otherwise by the Zoning Ordinance.

SECTION 7.10 RETAIL ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT10
A. Purpose.
The R/E District is intended to accommodate mixed and divergent uses within a narrowly defined area, which is largely self-contained and segregated from the surrounding developments. Because of the variant uses, it is intended that the R/E District be treated unlike and unique from any other district or zoning classifications. It is anticipated that the R/E District will be a tourist attraction with a regional impact and will generate traffic, noise and light, which will be greater than other areas. Therefore, the restrictions on the application of the R/E District as defined herein must be strictly applied. However, once established the R/E District will be characterized by an unconventional mix of uses that will, among other things, allow for multiple uses of parking facilities during any twenty-four (24) hour period without requiring each use to have an independent parking ratio as is required in other zoning districts. See Section 7.9 F. for parking regulation.

It is intended that matters dealing with platting and subdivision of any portion of the R/E District, development plans, signage, building height, parking, or traffic shall not need nor be required to have Planning Commission approvals; rather the Planning Staff and City Engineer are authorized to review and approve all such matters including but not limited to administrative subdivisions, access to public rights of way, and parking requirements.
The Planning Staff shall act upon any request within forty-five (45) days of submission of any application. If no response is received by, the applicant within said period the application shall be deemed approved.

D. Maintenance of Open Space.
Whenever common open space is provided, the Planning Commission or the City Council, as appropriate, shall require that an association of owners or tenants be created for the purpose of maintaining such open space. It shall be created in such a manner that owners of property shall automatically be members and shall be subject to assessments levied to maintain said open space for the purposes intended. The period of existence of such association shall not be less than twenty (20) years, and it shall continue thereafter and until a majority vote of members shall terminate it.
E. Parking.
Within the R/E District, there will be numerous businesses and activities that will allow for shared use of parking facilities and areas that will serve as parking for some events but as other uses when not assigned as parking. Therefore when reviewing parking needs for the R/E District, no specific parking ratio will be required. The Planning Staff and City Engineer must consider the uses, timing of such uses and functionality of the areas for the R/E District as a whole and not require each site to maintain a self-supporting parking requirement. The R/E District may have designated event/overflow parking that may be maintained as grassed or partially grassed areas. As used herein an event facility shall be one that is not open on a normal basis. Such designation as event/overflow parking shall not prohibit the designation of the same area for other uses or
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
82
activities at times when not being used as parking. For example, an area used for a drive-in theatre may also be considered as parking for events such as a concert or other entertainment or retail venues.
F. Green Space (Landscaping Areas).
Any green space requirements for any property being developed within the R/E District shall be considered for the R/E District as a whole. The Owner shall submit an overall landscape and screening plan to the City Planner. Green space may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs, ground cover, and other materials such as rocks, water, sculpture, art, walls, paving materials and street furniture. Each site shall not be required to maintain a self-supporting green requirement. In considering the green space for the R/E District, the Planning Staff shall consider each and every area within the R/E District that maintains any grass or other vegetation toward any green requirement even if such area is used for some other use such as, for example, parking, and drive-in theatre or amphitheater.11

Sec. 8.17 CONDITIONAL USE13
A. Purpose.
Conditional uses are those uses that may have some special impact when proposed for location in particular zoning district or uniqueness such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed d in a particular location. At that time, a review of the location, design, configuration, and impact is conducted to determine whether the proposed use should be permitted by weighing public need or benefit against the local impact. The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the use; planned and proposed public and private developments that may be adversely affected by which it is suggested is necessary or desirable to provide a development that is in the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the area or the City of Opelika; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, safety, and welfare in general.
B. Applicability.
Any use that is permitted as a conditional use by this ordinance shall comply with this Section. Any permitted use proposed for development at a land use intensity that exceeds the maximum permitted by the district, provided it does not exceed the maximum allowed by this ordinance, shall comply with this Section. Any renovations reuse, or preservation proposal that includes a change of use that is not allowed by the zoning district in which the structure is located, shall comply with this Section. Any use that involves filling of a floodplain shall comply with this Section.
C. Procedure.
1. Applications for a conditional use permit shall be submitted simultaneously with an application for a building permit unless prior approval has been obtained. Applications must be submitted (21) twenty-one days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at which they are to be heard. Applications for conditional uses in all districts must contain the following information:
a. Applications involving new construction, additions, or site reconfiguration must comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.16 except for subsection E. Technical Information which is only required at the conditional use approval stage if requested by the City Staff or the Opelika Planning Commission. This
13 Date of Amendment: February 6, 2018 Ordinance No. 01-18
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007
111
does not obviate any need for these items during a later site plan or technical review.
b. Applications for conditional uses that do not require external modification or improvements, such as those in an existing building in a downtown environment or suite in an existing and multi-tenant building, may with approval of the Planning Director submit a reduced conditional use application limited to the internal space or other relevant information.
2. The application shall be denied if the Planning Commission finds either that the application and records fail to establish compliance with the standards made applicable to the proposed location, will be inconsistent with the standards applicable to it pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance. Further, the application shall be denied if the adverse impacts of the development, after taking into consideration any proposals of the applicant and any conditions that might be imposed by the Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance to ameliorate them, outweigh any public or private benefits of the proposal and require denial of the conditional use approval in the interest of the overall public health, safety, and welfare.
3. In order to prevent or minimize adverse affects from the proposed use and development. On other properties in the neighborhood and on the general health, safety, and welfare of the City of Opelika, the Planning Commission may, in approving the application for any conditional use permit, impose such restrictions and conditions on such approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant to such approval as it determines are required by the general purposes, goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and this ordinance. All conditions imposed upon any conditional use permit approval, with the exception of conditions made applicable to such approval by the express terms of this ordinance, shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting such conditional use permits.
4. Within thirty (30) days of the public hearing on the application, unless an extension of this time is agreed to by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall either grant the application for a conditional use permit, grant it subject to conditions, or deny it. The failure of the Planning Commission to act within this time period shall constitute a decision by it that the application be approved.
5. In the event a permit for conditional use is approved or approved subject to conditions, the applicant shall in writing within fifteen (15) days following such decision, acknowledge such approval and unconditionally accept and agree to any conditions imposed on the approval. The City Planner shall then take action to process the application on the zoning certificate for the development to which the conditional use permit applies. In the event such permit is not approved or is approved subject to conditions that are not acceptable to the applicant, the applicant may, within the aforesaid time period, either appeal such decision to Circuit Court or abandon the application at the expiration of this fifteen (15) day period.
Zoning Ordinance, Section VIII: General Provisions, November 7, 2007

SECTION 8.18.1 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD)15
A. Purpose.
The intent of this section is to provide alternatives to the conventional residential development regulations that are permitted in Opelikas Land Development Regulations protecting existing land uses and property values. This section permits greater flexibility in residential design in order to encourage innovative residential plans, promote superior residential developments, and offer neighborhood amenities such as usable open space, designated recreational areas, sidewalks, decorative street lighting, and streetscapes. The Planning Commission will determine if the application, subdivision plan, and site design conform to the requirements of these regulations and that the development will accomplish the following purposes:
1. To ensure compatibility is achieved with adjacent land uses that differ in function, scale, and intensity16 or with future adjacent land uses based on adjacent zoning districts. Compatibility is achieved when adjacent land uses do not create adverse effects upon one another. The subdivision layout and design should reflect the inherent character of the existing land uses yet demonstrate distinctive features that will give the development a sense of identity. In areas where different uses abut, a variety of measures may be employed to ensure compatibility including: the use of adequate setbacks, landscaping, perimeter buffers, and building height considerations.
2. To conserve and preserve land to assure that its development will best maintain or enhance the appearance, character, natural beauty and historic interest of an area;
3. To preserve land for common area for neighborhood amenities;
4. To encourage development in such a way as to promote the most appropriate use of land, considering its particular size and topography, to protect natural drainage systems, streams, wetlands, floodplains, and to properly manage for stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation control.
15 Date of Amendment: November 6, 2001 Ordinance No. 165-01
16 Intensity refers to comparing the impact of a proposed development with adjacent land uses and zoning districts by evaluating characteristics such as the number of dwelling units per acre and amount of site coverage. Scale and bulk refers to dwellings that are of reasonable proportions (size, height) to existing dwellings and dwellings that are reasonably consistent and compatible with a style and the character in the vicinity.

SECTION 8.24 ADULT BUSINESS REGULATIONS28
A. Purpose and Intent.
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate adult-oriented businesses, which, unless closely regulated, tend to have serious secondary effects on the community. The City of Opelika has recognized that adult businesses, due to their nature and deleterious secondary effects, can have serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life. The secondary effects on the community include, but are not limited to, the following: negative impacts on children, increased crime against women and children, public health concerns including sexually transmitted diseases, depreciation of property values and increase in vacancies in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of adult businesses, interference with residential property owners' enjoyment of their property when such property is located in the vicinity of adult businesses as a result of increases in crime, litter, noise and vandalism, and higher crime rates in the vicinity of adult businesses. Special regulations of adult businesses are necessary to minimize these adverse effects and the potential degradation of sensitive areas (schools, place of worship, etc.) and neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult businesses.
The City of Opelika recognizes the free speech rights of businesses and individual consumers. It is neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. It is neither the intent nor the effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to communication materials or to deny access by the distributors of adult businesses to their intended market. However, after considering citizen testimonies and recommendations from professional staff concerning the secondary effects of adult businesses on the community, the City determined this ordinance is necessary to establish reasonable regulations to reduce the secondary effects that adult businesses have upon the residents of the City.
Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the State of Alabama regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.
Section 19 Indecency and Obscenity of the Code of Ordinances, City of Opelika concerning indecency, obscenity, and related offences prohibits the following:

b. Background surface signs. The area of a sign consisting of copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, or parapet of a building surface or another surface, that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or ellipses that will enclose each word, graphic or discrete visual element in the total sign.
c. Illuminated background signs. The area of a sign with copy mounted, affixed, or painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated element or a building or structure, is measured as the entire illuminated surface or illuminated element which contains sign copy.
d. Double-faced signs. If a sign has two display faces, and the perimeter of both faces coincide, are parallel, and are not more than twenty-four (24) inches apart, then the sign area is one sign face only Otherwise, the sign faces are considered to be separate signs and sign faces and subject to any and all applicable restrictions.
e. Multi-faced signs. If a sign has three or more faces, then the sign area is equal to fifty percent (50%) percent of the aggregate area of all sign faces. The area of each face shall be determined according to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable.

The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average finished grade of the ground below the sign excluding any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purposes of increasing the height of the sign, to the top edge of the highest portion of the sign. The maximum height allowed for a freestanding sign, however, shall not include any architectural embellishment provided the embellishment does not exceed thirty-six (36) inches at the base of the sign and eighteen (18) inches at the top of the sign.

(6) Permits not required for change of sign copy. No permit or permit fee shall be required for changing the copy of a sign, as long as no changes are made to the signs height, size, location, or structure. This exemption shall also apply to any change of copy on a changeable copy sign.
(7) Sign permit applications. A sign permit application for a permanent sign as may be required by this section shall be prepared and submitted on forms available at the Department of Planning.

193
of the decision on the grounds that the Director of Planning may have overlooked or failed to consider any fact(s) that would support a different decision.

g. If an applicant believes that his or her speech rights are being denied due to enforcement of subsection (8)c. or (8)e., above, he or she may immediately contact the planning department director, in writing via certified letter, and request immediate review of any pending sign permit application. If such a letter is received by the planning department director, the City shall have twenty (20) calendar days to review the permit application as under subsection (8)a., above, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (8)c or (8)e., above. If the Director of the Planning Department does not respond to the applicant following receipt of the certified letter, the substance of the applicants complaint shall be deemed rejected.
h.

Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: May. 18, 2016 Ord. No 113-16
195
that there has been any false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact in the application or plans on which the sign permit was based, the permit holder shall be notified of the violation. If the permit holder fails or refuses to make corrections within ten (10) calendar days, it shall be the duty of the Director of Planning to revoke such sign permit and serve notice upon such permit holder. Such notice shall be in writing and signed by the Director of Planning. It shall be unlawful for any person to proceed with any part of work after such notice is issued.
SECTION 9.11. NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
All signs that are lawfully in existence or are lawfully erected and that do not conform to the provisions of this Section IX or the Zoning Ordinance are declared nonconforming signs. It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination of nonconforming signs as expeditiously and fairly as possible is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this section. It is also the intent of this section that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights.
(1) Legal nonconforming signs:
a. A legal nonconforming sign is a sign that lawfully existed at the time of the enactment of this section that does not conform to the regulations as specified in this section.
b. A legal nonconforming sign may continue to be utilized only in the manner and to the extent that it existed at the time of the adoption of this section or any amendment thereof.
c. A legal nonconforming sign may not be altered in any manner not in conformance with this section. This does not apply to reasonable repair and maintenance of the sign or to a change of copy provided that by changing the copy structural alterations are not required.
d. Any building permit for an addition, alteration, or improvement valued at more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure or building for work at locations where any nonconforming sign exists shall specify and require that such nonconforming signs located within the boundaries of the development site, and within the limits of the applicants control, shall be brought into conformance with the provisions of this section, provided that if the nonconforming sign is a type of sign that is prohibited under Section 9.4, Prohibited Signs in All Zoning Districts, it shall be removed.
e. Legal nonconforming signs that are located on a parcel of property that is severed from a larger parcel of property and acquired by a public entity for public use by condemnation, purchase or dedication may be relocated on the remaining parcel without extinguishing the legal nonconforming status of that sign provided that the nonconforming sign:
Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: May. 18, 2016 Ord. No 113-16
196
(i). Is not increased in area or height to exceed the limits of the zoning district in which it is located;
(ii). Remains structurally unchanged except for reasonable repairs or alterations;
(iii). Is placed in the most similar position on the remaining property that it occupied prior to the relocation; and
(iv). Is relocated in a manner so as to comply with all applicable safety requirements.
After relocation pursuant to this subsection, the legal nonconforming sign shall be subject to all provisions of this section in its new location.
(2) Signs rendered nonconforming:
a. Except as provided in this section, a nonconforming sign may continue in the manner and to the extent that it existed at the time of the adoption, amendment or annexation of the section that rendered the sign nonconforming. This section shall not prohibit reasonable repairs and alterations to nonconforming signs.
b. A nonconforming sign shall not be re-erected, relocated or replaced unless it is brought into compliance with the requirements of this section. An existing monument sign that conforms to the size and height limitations set forth herein, but is otherwise nonconforming, may be relocated a single time to another location on the same parcel.
c. Any nonconforming sign shall be removed or rebuilt in full conformity to the terms of this section if it is damaged or allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the cost of repair or restoration is fifty (50) percent or more of the cost of replacement of such sign.
(3) Signs for a legal nonconforming use:
a. New or additional signs for a nonconforming use shall not be permitted.
b. A nonconforming sign for a nonconforming use that ceases to be used for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days or is replaced by a conforming use, shall be considered a prohibited sign and shall be removed or brought into conformance upon establishment of a conforming use.
(4) Signs discontinued:
a. Sign structures that remain vacant, unoccupied or devoid of any message, or display a message pertaining to a time, event or purpose that no longer applies shall be deemed to be discontinued.
Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: May. 18, 2016 Ord. No 113-16
197
b. A nonconforming sign deemed discontinued shall immediately terminate the right to maintain such sign.
c. Within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after a sign structure has been discontinued, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner or the property owners authorized agent to remove the discontinued sign and to parch and conceal any and all damage to any other structure resulting from removal of the sign.
d. Removal of a discontinued nonconforming sign shall include all sign support components, angle irons, poles, and other remnants of the discontinued sign that are not currently in use, or proposed for immediate reuse as evidenced by a sign permit application for a permitted sign.
(5) Unsafe Signs:
a. If the building official determines any sign or sign structure to be in an unsafe condition, he/she shall immediately notify, in writing, the owner of such sign who shall correct such condition within forty-eight (48) hours.
b. If the correction has not been made within forty-eight (48) hours, the building official may have the sign removed if it creates a danger to the public safety or have any necessary repairs or maintenance performed at the expense of the sign owner or owner or lessee of the property upon which the sign is located.
(6) Nonconformance of Signs. In addition to the provisions hereinabove, the following provisions shall apply.
a. All existing signs that are not specifically allowed or that do not comply with all the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall be considered nonconforming signs and shall not, after the effective date of this Section IX, be relocated, enlarged, structurally altered or extended unless such sign shall be made to comply with all provisions of this Section IX.
b. Any sign that was not specifically allowed or that did not comply with any previous version of the Zoning Ordinance is illegal if the same was relocated, enlarged, structurally altered or extended prior to the effective date of this Section IX unless the same had been made to conform to all the provisions of the Zoning Code prior to the effective date of this Section IX or unless the same received any vested right through a settlement agreement.
c. Normal repairs and repainting of a nonconforming sign is permitted. However, when a nonconforming sign is structurally repaired, damaged or destroyed by any means including neglect to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value, exclusive of foundations, as determined by the Chief Building Inspector or his or her designee, the nonconforming sign shall not thereafter be restored, unless such sign shall be made to conform to all the provisions of this Section IX. A sign damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value shall be removed within ninety (90) calendar days by the property owner. In the case of a

A change in the primary use of a lot shall be determined from the matrix table in Section 7.3 C. of the Citys Zoning Ordinance. A change of primary use shall occur when the proposed use is different from the existing use as shown in the matrix table.
e. All existing portable signs still located in any zoning district shall be considered nonconforming and shall be removed unless permitted herein.
f. All existing billboards located in any zoning district, except as permitted in subsection g., below, shall be considered nonconforming and shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of this Section IX, the Zoning Ordinance and the City Code.
g.

In the absence of a specific right that is explicitly provided in a settlement agreement, there shall be no vested right to erect or maintain any billboard. Specifically, there is no vested right in the manner of operation of a billboard or its characteristics, such as brightness or hours of illumination, unless application of new rules is precluded. Further, nothing herein shall provide a defense to any claim or assertion by any affected person that a billboard or its operation constitutes a public or a private nuisance.
SECTION 9.12. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
(1) Maintenance of Sign Location. For a sign requiring a sign permit, weeds and grass, all foliage shall be kept cut in front of, behind, underneath, and from around the base of the sign for a minimum distance of ten (10) feet from the sign base, and there shall be no rubbish or debris within ten (10) feet of the sign base or underneath the sign.

SCHEDULE A
Pursuant to Section 9.12(3), entitled Reduction of Non-Digital Billboards through Conversion to, or Replacement by, Digital Billboards, it is recognized that the City has a goal to reduce in the number of billboards in the City. In addition to ordinary attrition and in addition to the destruction of billboards through Acts of God, lawful nonconforming non-digital billboards that currently exist within the City may be removed by other means. Specifically, such nonconforming non-digital billboards may be converted to nonconforming digital billboards based upon the trade ratio, the sunset provision, and the other conditions as set forth in this Schedule A.
Except as specifically set forth in this Schedule A, no vested rights shall accrue to any person or entity.
This Schedule A provides for a minimum trade ratio of 4:1, namely at least four (4) qualifying nonconforming non-digital billboard sign faces (each qualifying sign face must equal or exceed two hundred twenty-five square feet (225 sq. ft.) must be removed as a pre-condition for the vested right to place one and no more than one (1) digital billboard sign face into operation. The replacement digital billboard structure shall have no more than two (2) digital faces, with any one digital sign face not exceeding three hundred square feet (300 sq. ft.). The surrounding cabinet or border shall not exceed six inches in width. Each sign face, up to a maximum of two sign faces per billboard structure, qualifies as an existing sign face so that the removal of an existing billboard structure with two (2) or more sign faces qualifies as the removal of two existing sign faces. However, all sign faces shall be removed from an existing billboard structure and the structure and visible foundation demolished and removed in order for each removed sign face to qualify as an eliminated sign. Each digital changeable face qualifies as a replacement sign face under this schedule. However, each advertising face within a digital changeable face shall not count as an additional replacement sign face. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an eliminated sign structure has more than two (2) sign faces, only two sign faces count as a qualifying replacement sign face. Each replacement billboard sign structure shall be located at the site of an eliminated sign which was demolished and removed. In other words, all replacement sign structures are restricted to the locations of qualifying signs eliminated under this Schedule A. Replacement signs shall not be relocated to new sites or locations. All replacement signs shall meet all requirements and regulations of the City of Opelika and all applicable laws and regulations of the State of Alabama. Absent compliance with the foregoing, no building permit shall issue. If any building permit is issued without complying with the foregoing, then the building permit is void ab initio.
This Schedule A provides for a sunset period of twenty-five (25) years for any new digital billboard structure (inclusive of any new digital sign faces), meaning that any new digital billboard structure and any new digital billboard faces that are so placed must be physically removed in their entirety immediately upon the passage of twenty-five (25) years following their placement into operation or following the erection of the new billboard structure, whichever comes first.
Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: May. 18, 2016 Ord. No 113-16
203
Any nonconforming non-digital billboard structure that is voluntarily removed as a result of the loss or termination of lease, or that is substantially destroyed by an Act of God, shall not be eligible to be counted as a qualifying non-digital billboard structure.
Any new digital billboard structure, inclusive of its digital billboard face(s), shall be and remain nonconforming under the Citys Zoning Ordinance during the twenty-five (25) year sunset. In the event that any such structure is destroyed by an Act of God or is removed due to a loss or termination of lease before the conclusion of the twenty-five year period, then the structure may not be rebuilt or re-established elsewhere; and, in any such event, the sunset period shall be deemed at an end even though twenty-five year period has not fully elapsed, and any and all vested rights that then existed shall be fully and completely extinguished.
Any new digital billboard structure and its digital billboard faces(s) that may be erected or placed in operation pursuant to this Schedule A shall be subjected to the following conditions as to placement [and operation]:
1. Digitally converted billboards (replacement billboards) shall be a minimum of two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet apart from any other digital billboard on the same road facing in the same direction of travel.
2. The new digital billboard structure shall be no higher than thirty (30) feet to the top of the sign structure or sign face from the ground level at the foot of the sign structure.
3. The new digital billboard structure shall only be located on one of the following roads, highways, or locations: I-85 or within one hundred (100) feet of I-85 and the Gateway Overlay Corridor Zoning District. However, no replacement billboard shall be located in the C-1 Zoning District or within the boundaries of any historic preservation district.
4. The new digital sign faces shall not exceed three hundred square feet (300 sf.).
5. The messages on any digital sign face shall not change more frequently than once every ten (10) seconds.
6. Any digital sign shall abide by the brightness and luminance standards as are established from time to time for all digital signs that utilize lighting to display messages.
7. No digitally converted billboard (replacement billboards) shall be placed within any street right-of-way and no closer to the street right-of-way than the existing billboard.
8. Electrical wiring shall run underground from the power source to serve the digitally converted billboard.
9. The City, through appropriate personnel, may exercise its police powers to protect public health, safety and welfare by requiring emergency information to be displayed on digitally converted billboards. Emergency information includes, but is not limited to AMBER alerts, dangerous criminal alerts, fugitives from justice alerts, weather alerts and emergency
Zoning Ordinance, Section IX: Sign Regulations Date of Amend: May. 18, 2016 Ord. No 113-16
204
management information. Upon notification, and at no cost to the City, the sign operator shall exclusively display the emergency alert for the period of one (1) hour. Thereafter, emergency alerts are to remain in rotation according to the designated issuing agencies protocols.
10. As part of the digital permitting process, the owner of a static billboard sign must identify in its application the following:
(a) The location of the static billboard face to be replaced
(b) The size of the static face to be replaced
(c) The size of the digital billboard face being installed
(d) The location of four (4) other billboard faces being removed

209
SECTION 10.6 LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS
A. Steps for Approval.
Step 1 Determine the number of base points required via shade trees, shrubbery or a combination thereof; [see Section 10.6(B)]
Step 2 Determine the number of Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs which must be planted. The quantity of plants required is based on the number of parking spaces proposed; [see Section 10.6(C)]
Step 3 Determine whether Residential and/or Parking Lot Buffers apply to the development; [see Section 10.6(D)]
Step 4 Develop a Landscape Plan with plantings in sufficient numbers to meet the point requirements and with any applicable buffer. [See Section 10.5(A)]
B. Shade Planting Requirements/Point System.
Each developed area must equal or exceed a minimum number of "base points" in order to obtain approval. The number of points required depends on the size of the developed area (see Table 1). Different types of plantings are worth different points; Large Trees are worth eleven (11) points, Medium Trees are worth eight (8) points, Understory Trees are worth five (5) points, and Shrubs/groundcovers are worth one (1) point (see Table 2).
The developer may use any combination of plantings to obtain the necessary number of points. Different lots and landscapes will lend themselves to different types of plantings. This Ordinance attempts to encourage creativity and diversity in landscaping. In no cases, however, shall a mono-culture of plantings be allowed. A variation of plantings, at least three (3) different species, is required.
In order to obtain points, the plantings must be placed on the developing property and not on a public right-of-way.

* When only small portions of large lots are developed, (e.g. only one (1) acre of a ten acre lot) only the immediate construction area shall be considered when determining the number of points required. Contact the Planning Department to determine the immediate construction area.
Alternative formula for determining number of points required for sites greater than 60,000 square feet:
Base points= [(X - 10,000)/500] + 40 {X=Construction Area}

C. Parking Lot Requirements.
All non-covered, street-level parking facilities established and governed by this Section shall be landscaped in accordance with the following requirements:
1. In addition to the number of "base points" required with shade plantings, one (1) additional, point is added to the site for each parking space proposed. These points must be used to plant "Parking Lot Trees and/or Parking Lot Shrubs." (E.g. a 26,000 square foot lot requires 80 base points; however, it also has 15 parking spaces. The additional 15 points brings the lot up to 95 points, with 15 of those points designated as Parking Lot Trees and/or shrubs.)
2. On parking lots with less than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs" may be spaced around the lot as desired to provide a uniform and attractive design.
3. On lots with more than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, "Parking Lot Trees/Shrubs" shall be planted on "parking lot island(s)" and/or "parallel planting peninsulas" within the confines of the established parking lot. These plantings will minimize and break the expanse of asphalt and concrete. Acceptable islands and parallel planting peninsulas are displayed in Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix.
4. Each "parking lot island" or "parallel planting peninsula" shall have at least one (1) tree.
Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991
211
D. Buffers and Buffer Zones.
In addition to the required number of points above, a parcel may be required to buffer certain portions of the property.
Trees from the "Recommended Tree List" planted to meet either Residential or Parking Lot buffer requirements, may be applied toward the point requirements. Shrubs may not be applied toward the point requirements. This provision allows credit for plantings in the buffer area(s); however, it prevents a property from planting only in those areas.
In cases where a parking area abuts a residential zone, then the more stringent "Residential Zone Buffer" requirements supersede the parking lot buffer.
1. Residential Zone Buffer (see diagrams).
On any commercial, industrial, institutional, PUD or multi-family development, except duplexes, adjacent to or abutting a residential zoning district, a buffer strip along the property line(s) of the developing property is required.
The buffer shall run the entire length of the abutting lot line(s). The type of buffer may consist of any or all of the following: (see Residential Buffer Options in the Appendix)
a. An opaque fence not less than six (6) feet in height, with horizontal or vertical
openings not greater than three (3) inches per one (1) linear foot AND a four (4) foot wide strip of Evergreen plantings, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height within three full growing seasons planted on the inside of the fence or;
b. A staggered double row of Evergreen plantings at least six (6) feet in
width, which will grow to at least six (6) feet in height and spaced in a manner which after three (3) years will provide an impervious visual barrier or;
c. Natural, undisturbed forest at least twenty (20) feet in width that provides a
nearly impervious visual barrier due to the dense nature of the plants and/or trees. If this option is chosen, the City Horticulturist shall determine whether the barrier is satisfactory through a site inspection prior to plan approval. Barriers shall be erected during construction to ensure the area is protected from damage due to construction.
2. Parking Lot Buffer: Asphalt closer than ten (10) feet to any property line shall be buffered with one of the following types of buffers:
a. A planting strip of no less than four (4) feet in width shall be provided between said property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt). A planting screen or hedge, of developers choice, and between two (2) and four (4) feet in height shall be provided and maintained on a continuing basis, except that such screen or hedge shall not obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block pedestrian walkways or sidewalks and/or,
b. A six (6) foot wide single row of understory, medium, or large trees located between said property line and the off-street parking facilities (asphalt). The trees shall be spaced in a ratio of one (1) understory tree every fifteen (15) feet, or one (1) medium tree every thirty (30) feet, or one (1) large tree every forty-five (45) feet. Shrubbery shall be provided between the plantings.
Zoning Ordinance, Section X: Landscape Regulations, September 17, 1991
212
The shrubs/trees shall be maintained on a continuing basis, except that such plantings shall not obstruct or obscure sight lines, restrict vehicular movement, or block pedestrian walkways or sidewalks. The trees may be applied toward the base point requirement; however, the shrubs may not be applied.
SECTION 10.7 EXISTING TREE CREDITS
In order to encourage the preservation of Opelika's older trees, certain requirements relating to the number and density of new trees may be waived in the event existing trees are preserved.
A. For each existing "Significant Tree" with a D.B.H. between six (6) inches and ten (10) inches, fifteen (15) fewer points are required. For each existing "Significant Tree" between I l" and twenty-four (24) inches, twenty (20) fewer points are required. For each existing "Significant Tree" with a D.B.H. over twenty-four (24) inches, twenty-five (25) fewer points are required. However, precautions must be taken during construction to prevent damage to the existing tree(s), and any tree that dies during or because of construction must be replaced with a similar species or species approved by the City Horticulturist to equal lost tree points. (e.g. An Oak with a D.B.H. of twenty-five (25) inches is claimed as an existing tree, but subsequently dies. The developer must replace the tree with tree plantings which exceed 25 points).
B. Trees for which an owner/developer wishes to receive credit must be in the developed area and cannot be in undeveloped portions of the parcel. This stipulation prevents a developer with a large tract of land from claiming credit on portions left undeveloped and thus eliminating landscaping on the developed portion of the parcel.
SECTION 10.8 MAINTENANCE
The owner is responsible for all maintenance and upkeep of planted trees in perpetuity within his/her development. After all plantings are finalized, the developer will schedule an inspection of the plantings with the City Horticulturist and landscape installer. If all plantings appear to be in good condition, the City Horticulturist will issue a Certificate of Completion to the developer and building official.
If plantings are subsequently damaged, in poor condition, diseased or dead, the City Horticulturist may require the property owner to replace the plantings and bring the lot back into compliance. Failure to bring the lot into compliance could lead to the City withholding a City of Opelika Business License.
