PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mountain Brook, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code (republished in 2000), as supplemented through April 11, 2005, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Sam Gaston, City Manager, Mr. Steve Boone, Finance Director, Mr. Carl Johnson, City Attorney, and Ms. Claire H. Puckett, Attorney at Law, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

A plea of guilty shall be accepted by the magistrate only after the defendant has executed the notice and waiver of rights provision on the summons and complaint and provided written proof that the defendant has properly registered the vehicle or trailer and paid the vehicle or trailer tax to the county department of revenue, including said tax due to the city. Settlement fines will be assessed pursuant to the following schedule, which may be amended from time to time by the city council: first violation, $200.00 fine per vehicle or trailer, plus court costs, and must provide proof that the vehicle or trailer has been properly registered and tag purchased. 
(f)  Payment of fine (first violation). Upon being charged with a first violation of this section, the above fines and costs may be voluntarily paid to the municipal court magistrate along with providing evidence of registration and payment of the vehicle or trailer tax to the county department of revenue not later than 72 hours before the court date shown on the summons and complaint. The magistrate shall be authorized to receive the amount in full settlement of the alleged offense and to give a receipt on behalf of the city. If such payment is made, no further prosecution for that specific violation shall be instituted or maintained in any court. All such payments must be made by personally appearing before said magistrate. 
(g)  Second or repeat violations. When a person is charged with a second or repeat violation of this section within two years of a prior violation, said person shall be required to appear in court to answer said charge. Upon an entry of a guilty plea or in the event said person is found guilty, he shall be fined not less than $200.00 and not more than $500.00 per vehicle or trailer, plus costs and expenses to be assessed by the court and must, within 30 days, of said guilty plea or determination of having violated this section, provide proof that the vehicle or trailer has been properly registered and tag purchased. If said person fails to provide proof of properly registering and purchasing said tag, then an additional summons and complaint shall be issued to said person to appear in court to answer for violation of this section. 
(h)  Trial. Any offender wishing to plead not guilty to a violation or who is otherwise required to appear in court for a violation of this section must execute a signature and written personal recognizance bond with the court magistrate assuring his appearance to answer the charge in the municipal court of the city on a certain date.

(2)  The written advice was reasonably relied on by the taxpayer; 
(3)  The written advice was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer; and

Revenue rulings may also govern procedures applicable to the city; and in such event, shall be called "revenue procedures." Such revenue rulings shall be binding on the city only with respect to the taxpayer making a written request for a revenue ruling and only with respect to the facts contained in such request. A revenue ruling shall constitute the city attorney's interpretation of the law or regulations as applied to the facts contained in such request, but only pertaining to the particular facts as described in such request, and to the taxpayer making such request. 
(b)  Revenue rulings may be issued only if no taxes have accrued with respect to the transactions, events, or facts contained in the written request for a revenue ruling at the time of the issuance of such ruling. 
(c)  Revenue rulings may be revoked or modified by the city attorney at any time; but any such revocation or modification shall not be effective retroactively unless: 
(1)  The person requesting such revenue ruling misstated or omitted facts material to the revenue ruling; 
(2)  The revenue ruling was issued with respect to a matter involving the computation or payment of a tax that was due and payable at the time the revenue ruling was requested; or 
(3)  The law (either statutory law or case law) applied by the city attorney in the revenue ruling is changed in a manner so as to alter the city attorney's conclusions in the revenue ruling and such change in the law is made effective as of the date of such revenue ruling. 
The taxpayer may petition for a hearing with the hearing officer to determine the propriety, under subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(3) of this section, of any retroactive revocation of a ruling. 
(d)  All revenue rulings issued by the city attorney shall be maintained as a public record and made available by the city clerk for public inspection and copying, within a reasonable time following their issuance, at a reasonable cost to be determined by the city clerk. Prior to making any such inspection and copies, the city clerk shall delete from the text of such ruling all names, addresses, titles, figures, dates, and other information, which may identify the particular taxpayer who requested the ruling. If a revenue ruling contains trade secrets or other confidential information, the city clerk shall, upon written request of the taxpayer, delete such information prior to allowing public inspection and copying. 
(e)  Requests for revenue rulings shall be submitted in writing to the city manager in such form and manner as prescribed by the city manager, accompanied by a fee as set forth in chapter 14. The city attorney shall either issue or refuse to issue a ruling within 30 days after receipt of the request unless the taxpayer consents to an extension of such time. If the city attorney refuses to issue such a ruling within the time prescribed, said fee shall be refunded to the taxpayer. A request may be withdrawn at any time prior to the issuance of the requested ruling, in which case no refund shall be made. 
(f)  Revenue rulings shall be issued in the name of the city. 
(Code 1996, § 6-62; Ord. No. 1360, § 7, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-28. - Contracts for examination of taxpayer's books and records. 
    The city may not enter into any contract or arrangement for the examination of a taxpayer's books and records if any part of the compensation paid or payable for the services of the person, firm, or corporation conducting the examination is contingent upon, or otherwise related to, the amount of tax, interest, court cost, or penalty assessed against, or collected from, the taxpayer. Any such contract or arrangement, if made or entered into, is void and unenforceable. Any assessment or preliminary assessment of taxes, penalties, or interest proposed or asserted by a person, firm, or corporation compensated under any such contract or arrangement shall likewise be null and void. This provision does not prohibit or restrict the city from entering into contracts or arrangements for the collection of any tax, interest, court cost, or penalty when the person, firm, or corporation making such collection has no authority to determine the amount of tax, interest, court cost, or penalty owed to the city.

Such books, records, and other information shall be open and available for inspection by the city upon request at a reasonable time and location. 
(b)  The city is authorized to examine and audit such records, books, and other relevant information maintained by any taxpayer or other person for the purpose of computing and determining the correct amount or value or correct amount of any tax, license, permit, or fee administered by the city, or for any other purpose necessary for the proper administration of any matter under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(c)  A taxpayer, or any officer of a corporation or association, or partner of a partnership, or fiduciary of a trust, or responsible individual of any entity under a duty to maintain such records, books and information pursuant to this subsection who fails or refuses to maintain such records, books and information, or permit inspection thereof, shall be subject to contempt proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which such person resides or has a place of business, or does business by agent, and upon proof of such fact to the court, may be punished for contempt as provided in cases of contempt in circuit court. 
(d)  The city is authorized to summon any witnesses to appear and give testimony, and to summon by subpoena duces tecum any books, records, or other information of any kind relating to any matter, which the city has authority to administer. The witness may be summoned by subpoena issued by any circuit judge, any magistrate, or any district judge, in the name of the city, directed to any sheriff of the state and returnable to the city, which subpoena may be served in like manner as subpoenas issued out of any circuit court, or the subpoena may be served by an authorized employee of the city or by certified mail. A fee shall be paid to banking institutions and other similar entities or any other person except the taxpayer, for copying, searching for, reproducing and transporting any records, books, or other information requested or subpoenaed by the city and to persons who are required to appear as a witness, which fee shall be equal to the fee authorized to be paid by the Internal Revenue Service for similar services or appearances pursuant to section 7610 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and as such fee paid by the Internal Revenue Service is in effect from time to time. If any witness has been duly subpoenaed to appear and testify or appear and produce records, books, or other relevant information, and fails or refuses to appear or testify or to produce such records, books or other information, such witness shall be subject to contempt proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which such witness resides, and upon proof of such fact to a circuit court may be punished for contempt as is provided in cases of contempt in circuit court. 
(e)  Upon demand by the revenue department or the authorized deputy, auditor or representative of the revenue department, (hereinafter in this article, such authorized deputy, auditor and representative shall be collectively referred to as representative), in addition to other provisions and requirements contained herein or in other ordinances or resolutions of the city, or acts applicable to city, it shall be the duty of any person who holds, or is required to hold, a license from, or pay any tax to, the city to furnish the revenue department or such representative all information referred to in this article in order to assist the revenue department in determining the proper classification of such license holder for license fee purposes and in determining the correct amount of the license fee to be paid by such person or the correct amount of any tax due by such person. To assist the revenue department in making such determination, it shall be the duty of such person to submit to the revenue department or its representative for inspection and examination during reasonable business hours at such person's place of business, whether located within or without the city, all books of accounts, invoices, papers, bank statements, reports, federal tax returns, state tax returns and memoranda containing information showing the amounts of sales, purchases, inventory and other information from which the correct license classification of such person and the correct amount of license fee payable by such person and the correct amount of any tax due may be determined. The city may assess and collect from the taxpayer the reasonable costs, based on the then current state government employee per diem rates incurred by, or charged to, the city in connection with performing an examination of the taxpayer's books, and records, if the taxpayer received notice by certified mail at least 30 days prior to the date on which the examination is to commence and the taxpayer either failed or refused to respond or did not propose a reasonable alternative commencement date for the examination within 15 days of receipt of notice of the pending examination, or the taxpayer and the city agree in writing as to an alternative date on which the examination was to commence but the taxpayer then fails or refuses to permit reasonable access to its records, books or other information on the alternative date. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to submit such records for examination and inspection upon such demand. 
(f)  The city manager is authorized and empowered to issue such forms and to make such reasonable regulations concerning any matter administered by the city under this article or any applicable state or local act or law.

The city may thereafter enter a preliminary assessment for the correct tax or value, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
(b)  Where the amount of tax or value reported on a return is undisputed by the city; or the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency, determination of value, or preliminary assessment in writing, the city may immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of said tax or value, plus applicable penalty and interest; provided, the city may at any time enter a final jeopardy assessment pursuant to section 26-40.

(3)  A preliminary assessment entered pursuant to section 26-30 may be entered within five years from the due date of the return on which the underlying tax is required to be reported or within five years of the date said return is filed, whichever is later.

(b)  In lieu of the appeal under subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may appeal from any final assessment to the circuit court of the county, or if the taxpayer does not reside in the county or have a place of business in the county, nor does business by agent in the county, to the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has its principal place of business in the state, by filing notice of appeal, within 30 days from the date of entry of the final assessment, with both the revenue department and the clerk of the circuit court in which such appeal is filed. If the appeal is to a circuit court, the taxpayer must, also within the 30-day period allowed for appeal, either pay the assessment plus interest, or file a supersedeas bond with the court in double the amount of the assessment. The supersedeas bond shall be executed by a surety company licensed and authorized to do business in the state and shall be conditioned upon the obligation to pay the assessment plus applicable interest and any court costs relating to the appeal. If a taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the clerk of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken that he has a net worth (on the basis of fair market value) of $20,000.00 or less, including his homestead, then the taxpayer may take such appeal without either paying the tax in full or posting a supersedeas bond in double the amount of the assessment. 
(c)  The filing of the notice of appeal with the revenue department for a hearing before a hearing officer or, in the case of appeals to the circuit court, the filing of the notice of appeal with both the revenue department and the clerk of the circuit court in which such appeal is filed and also the payment of the assessment in full and applicable interest or the filing of a bond as provided herein, are jurisdictional. If such prerequisites are not satisfied within the time provided for appeal, the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal to a circuit court or to a hearing officer, the final assessment shall be prima facie correct, and the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to prove that such assessment is incorrect. 
(d)  The hearing officer, circuit court or the appellate court on appeal may increase or decrease the assessment to reflect the correct amount due. If a final assessment is reduced on appeal, any overpayment of tax paid by the taxpayer shall promptly be refunded to the taxpayer by the city. No court shall have the power to enjoin the collection of any taxes due on such assessment so appealed or to suspend the payment thereof. 
(Code 1996, § 6-69; Ord. No. 1360, § 14, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-35. - Petition for refund allowed. 
    Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the city for any overpayment of tax or other amount erroneously paid to the city or concerning any refund which the city is required to administer; however, if a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the city, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment plus applicable interest has been paid in full prior to, or with the filing of, such petition for refund. The city may also issue automatic refunds pursuant to section 26-42. In the case of a petition for refund of sales taxes, use taxes, occupational taxes or any lodging tax and/or lodging privilege license fee, such petition must be filed jointly by the taxpayer who collected and paid over the tax or license fee to the city and the consumer or purchaser who paid the tax or license fee to the taxpayer. A direct petition may be filed by the taxpayer if the taxpayer never collected the tax or license fee from the consumer or purchaser, or if the tax or license fee has been credited or repaid to the consumer or purchaser by the taxpayer and the taxpayer provides the city reasonable evidence of such repayment. 
(Code 1996, § 6-70; Ord. No. 1360, § 15, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-36. - Time limitation for filing petition for refund; automatic refund. 
    A petition for refund must be filed with the city, or an automatic refund issued pursuant to section 26-42, or a credit allowed, within the later of three years from the date the return was filed, or two years from the date of payment of the tax. 
(Code 1996, § 6-71; Ord. No. 1360, § 16, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-37. - City required to grant or deny refunds; time limitations. 
    The city must either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition for refund is filed, unless said period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the city. The taxpayer shall be notified of the city's decision concerning the petition for refund by mail or certified mail, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the city fails to grant a refund within the time provided herein, then said petition for refund shall be deemed to be denied. 
(Code 1996, § 6-72; Ord. No. 1360, § 17, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-38. - Procedures if refunds granted; credit of refund; payment of other taxes; payment of interest. 
    If a petition for refund is granted, or the city otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the city. If the city determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus accrued interest may first be credited by the city against any outstanding final tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the city, and the balance of such overpayment, if any, shall be refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the city, the city shall provide a written detailed statement to the taxpayer showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment of other taxes, and the amount refunded. 
(Code 1996, § 6-73; Ord. No. 1360, § 18, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-39. - Procedures if refund denied; appeal. 
(a)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the revenue department for a hearing before a hearing officer within two years from the date the petition is denied, and such appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as hereinafter provided for appeals before a hearing officer. 
(b)  In lieu of filing a notice of appeal for a hearing as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the taxpayer may appeal from the denial of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court of the county, within two years from the date the petition is denied, or, if the taxpayer neither resides in the county nor has a place of business in the county, nor does business by agent in the county, the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has its principal place of business in the state, by filing such notice of appeal within two years from the date the petition is denied. The circuit court shall hear such appeal according to its own rules and procedures and shall determine the amount of the refund due, if any. 
(c)  If such appeal is not filed with the revenue department or the circuit court within two years from the date the petition is denied, then such appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
(Code 1996, § 6-74; Ord. No. 1360, § 19, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-40. - Jeopardy assessment. 
(a)  If the city finds that a taxpayer plans to depart from the city quickly or to remove his property from the city, or to perform any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect any tax, franchise fee or other fee imposed, collected or administered by the city, the city may issue notice of such finding to the taxpayer by personal service or mailing to his last known address, together with a demand for immediate payment of the tax declared to be in jeopardy, including penalties and additions thereto and such tax, penalty, interest, and additions thereto shall be immediately due and payable. A final assessment of such tax may be entered immediately and if the assessment is not paid upon such demand of the city, the city may forthwith issue a warrant for levy and distraint of any personal or other property of the taxpayer. 
(b)  In the case of a tax for a current period, the city may declare the taxable period of the taxpayer immediately terminated and may estimate the tax liability based upon the best information reasonably obtainable by the city. Notice of such finding and declaration shall be issued to the taxpayer in the same manner as provided for in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  When a jeopardy assessment has been made as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the collection of all or any part of such assessment may be stayed by filing with the revenue department an approved bond conditioned upon the payment of the assessment together with applicable interest and costs of collection. The city manager shall have sole discretion to approve or disapprove the bond, but such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(d)  In any proceeding in court to contest the jeopardy assessment or to enforce payment of the taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this section, the finding of the city, made as herein provided, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy. 
(e)  A final jeopardy assessment entered hereunder may be appealed to either the hearing officer or to the circuit court of the county, or, if the taxpayer neither resides in the county nor has a place of business in the county, nor does business by agent in the county, the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has its principal place of business in the state. If the appeal is to the hearing officer, the taxpayer must file the bond required by subsection (c) of this section. 
(Code 1996, § 6-75; Ord. No. 1360, § 20, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-41. - Failure to collect and pay over tax, or attempt to evade or defeat tax. 
(a)  Any person required to collect, account for, and/or pay over any tax who willfully fails to collect such tax, or account for, and/or pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable for a penalty up to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. 
(b)  If, within 30 days after the day on which notice and demand of any penalty under section 26-40(a) is made against any person, such person: 
(1)  Pays an amount that is not less than the minimum amount required to commence a proceeding in court with respect to his liability for such penalty; 
(2)  Files a claim for refund of the amount so paid; and 
(3)  Furnishes a bond that meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section; 
no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of the remainder of such penalty shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until a final resolution of a proceeding begun, as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  If, within 30 days after the day on which a claim for refund with respect to any penalty under subsection (a) of this section is denied, the person referred to in subsection (b) of this section fails to begin a proceeding in the appropriate court for the determination of his liability for such penalty, said subsection (b) of this section shall cease to apply with respect to such penalty, effective on the day following the close of the 30-day period referred to in this subsection. 
(d)  The bond referred to in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be in such form and with such sureties as the city manager may by regulations prescribe and shall be in an amount equal to 11/2 times the amount of excess of the penalty assessed over the payment described in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  If the city makes a finding that the collection of the penalty is in jeopardy, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the immediate collection of such penalty. 
(Code 1996, § 6-76; Ord. No. 1360, § 21, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-42. - Automatic refund. 
    If the city determines that a taxpayer is entitled to a refund, the city shall automatically refund to that taxpayer the amount of any excess tax so paid to the city; provided, however, that the statute of limitations provisions of the applicable tax law shall apply and such refund shall not be made if such statute of limitations has expired prior to the date on which the city determined that the refund was due to a taxpayer. 
(Code 1996, § 6-77; Ord. No. 1360, § 22, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-43. - Procedures governing the denial or revocation of licenses; permits and certificates of title administered by the department; procedures for contesting any other act or failure to act by the city; appeals therefrom. 
(a)  The city shall notify a taxpayer in writing of any act or refusal to act concerning the denial or revocation of a license, permit or certificate of title concerning which the taxpayer has any interest. The notice must be sent by either mail or certified mail to the taxpayer's last known address. Any taxpayer aggrieved by any act or proposed act or refusal to act by the city shall be entitled to file a notice of appeal from such act or proposed act or refusal to act with the revenue department for a hearing before a hearing officer. Such notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date notice of such act or refusal to act is mailed to the taxpayer, and such appeal, if timely filed, shall proceed as herein provided for appeals before a hearing officer. 
(b)  The city may proceed with the intended action if no appeal is filed by the taxpayer for a hearing before a hearing officer within 30 days of the mailing of the notice by the city to the taxpayer. 
(c)  This section shall not apply to the procedures governing assessments, and refunds which are otherwise provided for by this article, or to interdepartmental personnel actions or any matter which is the subject of any action then pending in state or federal court, or to the collection of any liability due the city. 
(d)  A taxpayer may appeal any matter governed by this section to the circuit court of the county, only after exhausting his appeal rights provided under this section. Any appeal to the circuit court must be from a final order issued by a hearing officer. 
(Code 1996, § 6-78; Ord. No. 1360, § 23, 6-28-1999) 
Sec. 26-44. - Authority and responsibilities of hearing official authority of a hearing officer. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish uniform procedures concerning appeals before a hearing officer and to establish the authority and responsibilities of the hearing officer concerning such appeals. The provisions of this section should be liberally construed to provide for the fair, efficient, and complete resolution of all matters in dispute. 
(b)  Authority of hearing officer. A hearing officer shall have the authority to schedule and conduct hearings and decide all appeals properly filed with the revenue department. A hearing officer shall have discretion to dismiss any appeal for failure or refusal to comply with any regulations ordinance or statute concerning appeals before a hearing officer, or for the failure or refusal to comply with any preliminary order issued by a hearing officer. If an appeal is dismissed by a hearing officer for any reason, then, for good cause, a hearing officer may reinstate the appeal. However, no appeal may be reinstated unless a motion to reinstate such appeal is filed with the hearing officer within 30 days of the date of entry of the order dismissing the appeal, or the appeal is reinstated by the hearing officer, ex mero motu, within such 30-day period. An order dismissing an appeal may be appealed to circuit court in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as appeals from final orders of a hearing officer. The order of dismissal shall be upheld by the circuit court unless the court finds an abuse of discretion by the hearing officer or finds that the order is otherwise unreasonable. 
(c)  Pre-hearing procedures. A notice of appeal filed with the revenue department for a hearing before a hearing officer shall, by specific reference, identify the assessment, refund or other act or refusal to act which is the subject of the appeal, the position of the appealing party (taxpayer), the basis on which relief should be granted, and the relief sought on the appeal. The revenue department shall notify the city attorney that an appeal has been filed, and the city attorney shall be required to file a written answer with the hearing officer within 30 days from receipt of such notice. The answer shall state the facts and issues in dispute and the city's position relating thereto, however, the hearing officer shall have discretion to require additional information from either the taxpayer or the city attorney or to allow the city attorney additional time, not to exceed 60 days, within which to file an answer. 
(d)  Hearings. An appeal may be held in abeyance by a written agreement of the parties or at the discretion of the hearing officer, or an appeal may be submitted for decision on a joint stipulation of facts without a hearing. Otherwise, a hearing shall be conducted by the hearing officer. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative by certified mail directed to the taxpayer's last known address. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing substantially as follows: 
(1)  Open the record and receive appearances; 
(2)  Receive testimony and exhibits presented by the parties; all testimony shall be made under oath and any person testifying under oath shall be subject to the perjury provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, § 13A-10-102; 
(3)  Further interrogate witnesses, if deemed necessary by the hearing officer; 
(4)  Require oral arguments and/or the submission of briefs and other authorities, if deemed necessary by the hearing officer; and 
(5)  Continue or reopen the hearing for the taking of additional evidence as deemed necessary by the hearing officer for a fair, efficient, and complete resolution, of the matter in dispute. 
(e)  Final order. The hearing officer shall enter a final order that shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. The final order shall provide such relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances. Any final order, unless altered or amended on appeal, shall have the same force and effect as a final order issued by a circuit judge sitting in the state. 
(f)  Application for rehearing. Either the taxpayer or the city may file an application for rehearing within 15 days from the date of entry of a final order by the hearing officer. The application for rehearing shall set forth the specific reasons and supporting arguments why the final order is incorrect and should be reheard. The other party may, but shall not be required to, file a response to such application within 20 days of the day a copy of the application was delivered to such other party or was mailed to such other party by certified mail. The timely filing of an application for a rehearing shall suspend the time period for filing an appeal to circuit court and the time for filing a notice of appeal shall be computed from the date of entry of the order of the hearing officer either granting or denying the application for rehearing. 
(g)  Pre-hearing conferences, preliminary orders, subpoenas. The hearing officer shall have authority to hold pre-hearing conferences and issue preliminary orders. 
(h)  Record of hearing, record on appeal. All hearings shall be tape recorded and transcribed by the city, at the request of either the city, the taxpayer or the hearing officer, with the expense of transcription charged to the requesting party. The record of the proceedings or transcript thereof shall be maintained by the revenue department for at least five years from the date of the hearing; provided, however, upon appeal to circuit court by either party the hearing officer shall cause the hearing to be transcribed at the cost of the appealing party and shall forward the original transcript or a certified copy of the transcript, with the administrative record, to the circuit court for use in the appeal. 
(i)  Rules of evidence at administrative hearing. The rules of evidence applicable in civil nonjury cases in the circuit courts of the state shall be followed in all hearings; however, when necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible to proof under those rules of evidence, evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted, in the discretion of the hearing officer, if relevant to the subject matter of the hearing or of the type commonly relied upon by prudent persons. The hearing officer may announce prior to or during a hearing that it shall not be necessary for either party to make objections during the hearing to any testimony or evidence offered by either party, and such objections shall be preserved and may be made on appeal; provided, however, the final order issued by the hearing officer shall be based only on such evidence as is relevant, competent, and material. Documentary evidence may be received in copy form if an opportunity to review the original is available and there is no objection thereto. Official notice may be taken of any technical facts within the specialized knowledge of the hearing officer, and the experience, technical competency, and specialized knowledge of the hearing officer shall be used in evaluating the evidence and issuing decisions based thereon, and shall be given appropriate weight in considering the order of the hearing officer on appeal. 
(j)  Authorized representatives; appearance of hearing. A taxpayer may be represented before the hearing officer by an authorized representative. If a taxpayer or his authorized representative fails to appear at a hearing after proper service of notice of the date and time of the hearing, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, dismiss the appeal with prejudice, adjourn the proceeding and reset the matter for a subsequent hearing or proceed with the hearing. 
(k)  Intervention. Any person may, upon application, be permitted to intervene in any case before a hearing officer if the person's individual rights are or may be affected by the outcome of the proceeding and the person's interest is otherwise not adequately represented in the case. 
(l)  Public records. All testimony, exhibits, documents, and other materials introduced into evidence at a hearing before the hearing officer, and all final and other orders issued by the hearing officer shall be deemed public information except: 
(1)  In those cases where information received from the Internal Revenue Service is restricted by law or agreement from disclosure; 
(2)  Any information that the city, under any state law or act or any ordinance of the city, is required to keep confidential; and 
(3)  As otherwise ordered by the hearing officer.

(2)  Levying or imposing excise taxes or inspection fees upon the sale of, use and other disposition of gasoline and other petroleum products; or 
(3)  Governing the licensing of motor vehicle dealers, reconditioners, rebuilders, wholesalers, and automotive dismantlers and parts recyclers. 
(c)  The orders of the hearing officer and all evidence submitted in any hearing before the hearing officer shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(d)  The city manager shall promulgate regulations permitting and governing the exchange of tax returns, information, records, and other documents obtained by the city, from tax officers of other agencies of the state, municipal, and county government agencies in the state, federal government agencies, any association of state government tax agencies, any state government tax agencies of other states and any foreign government tax agencies; provided, however, that any such tax returns, information, records, or other documents remain subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in subsection (a) of this section, and that such exchange must be for one or more of the following purposes: 
(1)  Collecting taxes due; 
(2)  Ascertaining the amount of taxes due from any person; or 
(3)  Determining whether a person is liable for, or whether there is probable cause for believing such person might be liable for, the payment of any tax to such federal, state, county, municipal or foreign government agency. 
(e)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the use of tax returns or tax information by the city or the assessing officials of the city in the enforcement, collection, and assessment of any tax. The city may also divulge to a purchaser, prospective purchaser, or successor of a business or stock of goods the outstanding sales, use, or rental tax liability of the seller for which the purchaser, prospective purchaser, as defined pursuant to the regulations of the state revenue department, or successor may be liable. Nothing herein shall prohibit the exchange of information between and among county or municipal governments, provided that any exchange shall be subject to the same restrictions and criminal penalties imposed on the city and its personnel as described in this section. In no event shall any damages, attorney fees, or court costs be assessed against elected officials, officers, or employees of the city. Nothing in this section shall preclude the inspection of returns by federal or foreign state agents as provided under Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-18-53.

Sec. 26-46. - Civil penalties levied in addition to other penalties provided by law. 
(a)  Failure to file return within time required. If a taxpayer fails to file any return required to be filed with the city on or before the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), there shall be assessed as a penalty ten percent of any additional tax required to be paid with such return. 
(b)  Failure to pay tax within time required. If a taxpayer fails to pay to the revenue department the correct amount of tax due on or before the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), there shall be added as a penalty one percent of the amount of such tax due if the failure to pay is for not more than one month, with an additional one percent for each additional month, or fraction thereof, during which such failure to pay continues, not exceeding 25 percent in the aggregate. In lieu of the penalty provided in the immediate preceding sentence, for any tax for which a monthly or quarterly return is required, or for which no return is required, the city shall add a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent tax. All such penalties shall help in defraying the cost to the city of collecting such delinquent taxes. 
(c)  Underpayment due to negligence. If any part of any underpayment of tax is due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of that part of the underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations. For purposes of this subsection, the term "negligence" includes any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the city's tax ordinances; and the term "disregard" includes any careless, reckless, or intentional failure to pay attention to the city's tax ordinances. 
(d)  Underpayment due to fraud. If any part of any underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to 50 percent of the portion of such underpayment which is attributable to fraud. For purposes of this section, the word "fraud" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to the term under 26 USC 6663, as in effect from time to time. 
(e)  Frivolous return penalty. If any taxpayer files a "frivolous return," as that term is used in 26 USC 6702, such taxpayer may be liable for a penalty of up to $250.00. 
(f)  Frivolous appeal penalty. If any appeal before a hearing officer or to the circuit court is determined by the hearing officer or the circuit court, respectively, to be frivolous or primarily for the purpose of delay or to impede collection of any tax, a penalty of $250.00 or 25 percent of the tax in question, whichever is greater, shall be assessed in addition to any tax and any interest and other penalty due. 
(g)  Penalties not exclusive. The penalties provided in this section for failure to file a return or pay tax when due, filing a frivolous return, filing a frivolous appeal, or negligence may be asserted against the same taxpayer for the same tax period. If the fraud penalty is asserted, no other penalties shall be asserted. 
(h)  Waiver of penalties. The city is authorized to reduce or waive any penalties upon a determination of reasonable cause. Reasonable cause shall include, but not be limited to, those instances where the taxpayer has acted in good faith in filing a return or reporting or paying any tax. However, the burden of proving reasonable cause shall be on the taxpayer. No penalty for fraud may be waived. 
(i)  Penalty and interest assessed as tax. All penalties and interest administered, levied or charged by the city shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.

(d)  Upon receipt of said notice the municipal clerk shall promptly schedule a hearing, to be held within 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice, before the municipal governing body and shall give the notice of the date, time and place of said hearing to the applicant. 
(e)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear personally, or through his counsel, or both, and the municipal governing body shall proceed to hear any evidence which may be presented both for and against the issuance of said license. 
(f)  If the municipal governing body determines from the evidence presented that in order to either provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity, or improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality said license should not be granted, it shall enter an order to that effect; otherwise, said license shall be ordered issued upon payment of any required license fees. 
(Ord. No. 1738, § 18, 8-13-2007) 
Sec. 26-223. - Procedure for revocation or suspension of license. 
(a)  Any lawful license issued to any person to conduct any business shall be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body for the violation by the licensee, his agent, servant, or employee of any provision of this article or of any ordinance of the municipality, or any state statute relating to the business for which such license is issued; and shall also be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body if the licensee, his agent, servant, or employee under color of such license violates or aids or abets in violating or knowingly permits or suffers to be violated any penal ordinance of the municipality or any criminal law of the state; and shall also be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body if, in connection with the issuance or renewal of any license, the licensee or his agent filed or caused to be filed any application, affidavit, statement, certificate, book, or any other data containing any false, deceptive or other misleading information or omission of material fact. 
(b)  The conditions hereinabove set forth as grounds for the revocation of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license. 
(c)  The municipal governing body shall set a time for hearing on the matter of revoking or refusing to renew a license; and a notice of such hearing shall be given to the licensee, or the applicant for renewal, as the case may be, at least ten days before the day set for said hearing.

(Ord. No. 1738, § 19, 8-13-2007) 
Sec. 26-224. - Refunds on overpayments. 
(a)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the municipality for any overpayment of business license tax erroneously paid to the municipality. If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the municipality, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment has been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the petition for refund. 
(b)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the municipality within two years from the date of payment of the business license tax, which is the subject of the petition. 
(c)  The municipality shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the municipality. The taxpayer shall be notified of the municipality's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class U.S. mail or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the municipality fails to grant a full refund within the time provided herein, the refund petition shall be deemed to be denied. 
(d)  If the petition is granted or the municipality or a court otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer by the municipality, together with interest to the extent provided for in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-92. If the municipality determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus any interest due thereon may first be credited by the municipality against any outstanding tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the municipality, and the balance of any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the municipality, the taxpayer shall be provided with a written detailed statement showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and the resulting amount of the refund. 
(e)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the municipality denying the petition for refund is located. Said notice of appeal must be filed within two years from the date the petition was denied. The circuit court shall hear the appeal according to its own rules and procedures and shall determine the correct amount of refund due, if any. If an appeal is not filed with the appropriate circuit court within two years of the date the petition was denied, then the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 1738, § 20, 8-13-2007) 
Sec. 26-225. - Delivery license. 
(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for $100.00 plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the municipality if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality or its police jurisdiction; 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the municipality other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite set-up and installation of said merchandise; 
(3)  Such delivery and set-up and installation is performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in that municipality, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the taxpayer; 
(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed $75,000.00 during the license year; 
(5)  Any set-up or installation shall relate only to: 
a.  That required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state or local law; and 
b.  The merchandise so delivered; 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the criteria listed in subsections (a)(1) through (5) of this section, then within ten days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase all appropriate business licenses from the municipality for the entire license year and without regard to this section. 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(e)  The purchase of a delivery license shall not, in and of itself, establish nexus between the taxpayer and the municipality for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of Code of Ala. 1975, title 40 (Code of Ala. 1975, § 40-1-1 et seq.) or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the municipality.

To secure such a permit, written application as hereinafter provided shall be made to the city manager, setting forth the information required by section 46-121(1). This application shall be submitted to the city manager's office at least 30 days before the date of the proposed parade, procession, public demonstration or public assembly.

(4)  The proposed public assembly is in an area prohibited by this article. 
(5)  The proposed public assembly presents a clear and present danger of destruction of life or property, or serious invasions of rights of privacy or breaches of the peace, and that danger is imminent and aggravated and amounts to more than slight inconvenience or annoyance.

Sec. 50-6. - Title. 
    This division shall be known as the "City of Mountain Brook Safe Streets Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 1687, § 1, 10-24-2005) 
Sec. 50-7. - Council findings. 
The city council finds and declares all of the following: 
(a)  Driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways is a privilege, not a right, and only properly licensed drivers are entitled to operate a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways. 
(b)  Significant numbers of drivers whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked continue to drive regardless of the law. 
(c)  Unlicensed drivers or drivers with suspended, revoked or expired licenses frequently cause traffic accidents involving properly licensed drivers. Many of these accidents are serious in nature, and those properly licensed drivers then become victims who suffer considerable pain and property loss as a result of the failure of others who fail to abide by the law. 
(d)  It is necessary and appropriate to take additional steps to prevent unlicensed drivers from driving when detected and to deter unlicensed drivers from driving at any time. The city has a critical interest in prohibiting said drivers from continuing to operate a motor vehicle when interdicted or detected, and further to temporarily remove the motor vehicle from the public streets so as to prohibit further immediate operation of the vehicle by the offender. 
(e)  The city has a critical interest in enforcing its traffic laws and in keeping unlicensed drivers from illegally driving. Impounding the vehicles driven by unlicensed drivers under appropriate circumstances shall prohibit continued illegal operation of the vehicle and ensure that the vehicle may not then be used by said unlicensed driver. Said removal serves a significant and legitimate governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Mountain Brook from the potential harm caused by unlicensed drivers. 
(Ord. No. 1687, § 2, 10-24-2005) 
Sec. 50-8. - Driver's license required. 
    Notwithstanding any provision of law, no person shall be allowed to operate a motor vehicle upon the streets and public highways of Mountain Brook, Alabama without a current, valid driver's license. If a driver is unable to produce a current, valid driver's license upon demand of a law enforcement officer, the driver shall be immediately removed from the vehicle, and shall not be permitted to further operate said vehicle unless: 
(a)  The officer is reasonably able to verify by other means that the driver is properly licensed; or 
(b)  The license of the driver expired within the proceeding 90 days and the driver would otherwise have been properly licensed; or 
(c)  There is an emergency or medical necessity jeopardizing life or limb either for one of the vehicle occupants or which requires the immediate response by that law enforcement officer at another location, and, in the officer's discretion, continued operation of the vehicle is necessary. 
(Ord. No. 1687, § 3, 10-24-2005) 
Sec. 50-9. - Impoundment of vehicle. 
    In the event that the officer cannot verify that a person is properly licensed, that the person would have been properly licensed but for the expiration of his or her license within the proceeding 90 days, or continued operation of the vehicle is necessary because of an emergency to life or limb as provided heretofore, the vehicle being driven shall be impounded regardless of ownership or possessory interest of the operator or person present in the vehicle unless the registered owner of the vehicle or another family member of the owner is immediately present, is identifiable as the owner or family member of the owner, is legally licensed to operate the vehicle, and no other circumstances exist which would interfere with the owner's operation of the vehicle. In the event that the vehicle is impounded, the occupants of the vehicle shall be transported to a place of safety. 
(Ord. No. 1687, § 4, 10-24-2005) 
Sec. 50-10. - Release of impounded vehicle. 
A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall be released if: 
(a)  The registered owner or a representative with written notarized authorization to act on behalf of the registered owner appears at the police department, and presents a valid driver's license, a copy of the title, tag receipt or notarized bill of sale, and a copy of the written authorization, if applicable, to be copied by the police department. 
(b)  If the registered owner does not have a valid driver's license, he/she may bring someone with him/her who has a verified valid license, and the vehicle may be released to that person without written notarized permission. 
Any vehicle not claimed within the time period provided by Code of Ala., tit. 32, ch. 13, as it may be amended from time to time, may be disposed of in accordance with that Alabama Code chapter or other municipal ordinance concerning same.

(Ord. No. 1737, § 1(4-5.8), 6-25-2007) 
Sec. 109-44. - Issuance of permit; expiration, suspension or revocation. 
(a)  The purpose of permitting plans and specifications is to ensure compliance with this article. The official's review and permitting of plans and specifications is not intended as approval of the overall layout, structural design, situation control, or construction procedures. These responsibilities shall remain with, and be those of, the owner and/or his consultants. 
(b)  The application, plans and specifications, reports, affidavits and other required documents shall be filed with the official as required by this article. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of the city to assess compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans and specifications filed therewith conform to the requirements of this article and other pertinent laws and ordinances, that all applicable fees have been paid and necessary surety obtained, he shall issue a permit to the owner. 
(c)  One set of permitted plans, specifications and other required documents shall be retained by the official for a period of not less than one year from date of completion of the work covered therein. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain one of the sets of permitted plans, specifications and other required documents on the site at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(d)  The issuance or granting of a permit shall not allow, or be construed as approval of, violation of any of the provisions of this article or any other laws or regulations; and such permit shall not be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful. 
(e)  The issuance of a permit shall not prevent the official from thereafter requiring that: 
(1)  Errors or inaccuracies in the approved application, including the related plans and specifications, be corrected; 
(2)  Changes due to unforeseen problems in the approved application, including the related plans and specifications, be made; or 
(3)  Other modifications be made to the permitted plans and specifications and in the conduct of operations at the site if significant problems occur which were not considered at the time the permit was issued. 
(f)  The official may require that all work being performed at the site be suspended until corrections, changes or modifications have been made to the satisfaction of the official. In the event corrections, changes or modifications are not made to the satisfaction of the official within the time specified by the official, the official may: 
(1)  Revoke the related permit; 
(2)  Cause all work being performed at the site to be ceased; and 
(3)  Cause such additional work to be performed, at the expense of the applicant, as the official determines will eliminate any hazards or nuisances existing at the site. 
(g)  All permits issued by the official under the provisions of this article shall expire by limitation and become null and void 24 months from the date of the issuance of the permit. In addition, all permits issued by the official under the provisions of this article shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 90 days from the date of issuance of the permit; provided, that one or more renewals of such permit may be granted, upon written request to the official for good cause shown and upon the payment of a reasonable fee to cover the cost of the city in considering such request for renewal so long as the work shall comply with all of the requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time application for renewal is made. The work authorized by such permit shall not be suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced and shall be carried to completion or the permit shall be terminated by the official and become void. Work authorized by a permit shall be presumed suspended or abandoned if no such authorized work is conducted at the site for a period of 14 consecutive days as determined by the official. If an applicant shows, to the satisfaction of the official, good cause for not conducting work during such period, the official may, in the official's discretion, choose not to terminate such permit. 
(h)  The official may suspend or revoke a permit issued under provisions of this article by giving notice in writing to the owner whenever the permit is issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied or in violation of any of the provisions of this article or any of the provisions of any regulation or any other ordinance. 
(i)  The work or use authorized under the permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this article shall only be as expressly set forth in such permit and, to the extent expressly incorporated by the permit, the application submitted in connection with such permit, including, if applicable, the plans and other written documentation. Should the owner desire to significantly modify the scope and/or nature of the work to be conducted pursuant to a permit issued by the city, or if the cost of construction exceeds that which was submitted to or determined by the building official as the basis for the cost of the permit fees addressed in section 109-2, the owner must submit a revised application for such work in accordance with the provisions of this article. The official, at the option of the official, may amend the permit previously issued or issue a new permit; provided that such application meets the requirements of this article, that any additional fees are paid, and that all of the other requirements of this section have been satisfied. In the event that the cost of construction exceeds that originally submitted or determined to be the appropriate basis for the permit fee, the owner, contractor or other person submitting the original application shall be responsible for any additional fees due after calculating the permit fee upon the updated estimate or construction cost. A failure to revise or update said permit when costs exceed that originally made the basis of the permit within 30 days of the date upon which said basis is exceeded shall result in an administrative penalty equal to the cost of the revised permit in addition to all other penalties which may be imposed for a violation of said ordinance.

    Upon the termination, cancellation, expiration or revocation of a permit, the official may cause such additional work to be performed, at the expense of the applicant, as the official determines will eliminate any hazards or nuisances existing at the site. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in addition to other rights that the city may have with respect to bonds or other security required by this article, upon the termination, cancellation, expiration or revocation of a permit, required bonds or other security may be used to correct or eliminate hazards or nuisances or complete the work authorized under the permit.

(1)  Any project within the boundaries of the Villages of Mountain Brook; 
(2)  Any project in any community shopping zoning district of the city; 
(3)  Any project or part of a project for which a development plan was submitted to the planning commission or the city council; or 
(4)  Any project involving three or more lots for which subdivision approval was required and requested within the five years preceding the permit request. 
(b)  For any such project, the property owner or his agent must execute and deposit with the city clerk a reclamation bond, irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or other depository licensed to do business in the state, or other form of security approved by the city council which shall be in a sufficient amount to return the property being cleared, excavated, graded, developed or constructed upon to a reasonably similar condition as it existed before any such activities were undertaken in the event such project is abandoned, suspended or unreasonably delayed. The necessary amount of such bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other approved security shall be determined by the building official after review of the permit application, materials submitted for review, construction plans and documents, and other matters which will further that determination. Such bond, letter of credit, or other security may be called by the city when the city has determined that a project has been abandoned, suspended or unreasonably delayed and when the property owner has failed to reclaim the property after 30 days notice by the city. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, a project shall be deemed to have been abandoned, suspended or unreasonably delayed in the following circumstances: 
(1)  For projects requiring a development plan containing completion times, when the project or a portion thereof is not completed in accordance with the completion schedule and the city has not granted an amendment or extension thereto; 
(2)  When continual, substantial and documentable progress toward completion on the project has not been observed by the city for a period of 90 days; or 
(3)  When work has not been performed for 30 days. 
(d)  In such cases where property has been cleared, graded or excavated and the city has determined that reclamation is warranted, reclamation of the property shall, at a minimum, consist of removal of roads, infrastructure or other improvements, reestablishing grades and slopes where feasible and planting of trees, shrubs or other vegetation similar to that existing on the site before development. Reclamation shall also consist of planting of trees no less in number than previously existing and of at least 21/2 inches in caliper for replacement of mature trees and those of similar size to the trees previously existing for trees smaller than 21/2 inches in caliper. No invasive, non-native vegetation shall be used in said reclamation."

(c)  One set of permitted plans, specifications and other required documents shall be retained by the official for a period of not less than one year from date of completion of the work covered therein. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain one of the sets of permitted plans, specifications and other required documents on the site at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. 
(d)  The issuance or granting of a permit shall not allow, or be construed as approval of, violation of any of the provisions of this article or any other laws or regulations; and such permit shall not be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful. 
(e)  The issuance of a permit shall not prevent the official from thereafter requiring that: 
(1)  Errors or inaccuracies in the approved application, including the related plans and specifications, be corrected; 
(2)  Changes due to unforeseen problems in the approved application, including the related plans and specifications, be made; or 
(3)  Other modifications be made to the permitted plans and specifications and in the conduct of operations at the site if significant problems occur, which were not considered at the time the permit was issued. 
(f)  The official may require that all work being performed at the site be suspended until corrections, changes or modifications have been made to the satisfaction of the official. In the event corrections, changes or modifications are not made to the satisfaction of the official within the time specified by the official, the official may: 
(1)  Revoke the related permit; 
(2)  Cause all work being performed at the site to be ceased; and

In addition, all permits issued by the official under the provisions of this article shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized, by such permit, is not commenced within 90 days from the date of issuance of the permit; provided, that one or more renewals of such permit may be granted, upon written request to the official for good cause shown and upon the payment of a reasonable fee to cover the cost of the city in considering such request for renewal so long as the work shall comply with all of the requirements of this article and other applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time application for renewal is made. The work authorized by such permit shall not be suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced and shall be carried to completion or the permit shall be terminated by the official and become void. Work authorized by a permit shall be presumed suspended or abandoned if no such authorized work is conducted at the site for a period of 14 consecutive days as determined by the official. If an applicant shows, to the satisfaction of the official, good cause for not conducting work during such period, the official may, in the official's discretion, choose not to terminate such permit. 
(h)  The official may suspend or revoke a permit issued under provisions of this article by giving notice in writing to the owner whenever the permit is issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied or in violation of any of the provisions of this article or any of the provisions of any regulation or any ordinance. 
(i)  The work or use authorized under the permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this article shall only be as expressly set forth in such permit and, to the extent expressly incorporated by the permit, the application submitted in connection with such permit, including, if applicable, the plans and other written documentation. Should the owner desire to significantly modify the scope and/or nature of the work to be conducted pursuant to a permit issued by the city, the owner must submit a revised application for such work in accordance with the provisions of this article.

    No construction or building permit shall issue and no activity of the type described in section 113-224(a) shall be undertaken pursuant to any such permit unless and until the owner of the property or his duly authorized agent shall have first secured a permit from the city that evidences compliance with the terms, conditions, and requirements of this article (hereinafter referred to as a "stormwater detention permit"). Upon issuance of the stormwater detention permit, no work in furtherance of the development shall proceed except in conformity with the plans and specifications upon which issuance of the permit was based. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-42; Ord. No. 1496, § 2, 11-13-2001) 
Sec. 113-226. - General stormwater detention and design objectives and criteria. 
(a)  The owner of land for which development is proposed, or a duly authorized agent thereof, shall submit to the city detailed engineering plans for the site proposed for development that will, when installed or otherwise implemented, minimize or, if practicable, eliminate any difference in the rate or velocity and volume of water ("differential runoff") discharged from the parcel for which the development or project is proposed prior to and after completion of the project. 
(b)  The goal of stormwater management design shall be to equalize amounts and rates of stormwater discharge based on peak flows for two-year through 100-year, 24-hour storms, and shall assume that land is fully developed in accordance with the city's comprehensive land use plan. Engineering data supporting differential runoff and detention volume calculations, as well as the adequacy of detention, discharge, and control structures, shall be submitted to the city for review. A description of the method to be used in maintaining components of the stormwater management system shall also be submitted. 
(c)  Stormwater management design will ordinarily be based on development of a single tract or parcel of land unless special topographical, drainage, or engineering considerations require design based on a larger area in order to achieve the purposes of this article. Where development activity is proposed for a lot or parcel that is part of a larger development plan, such as a subdivision that is to be developed in phases or sectors, the city may require that design criteria be based on the total development or project. When appropriate, land that is not within the city limits should be included within the engineering studies that form the basis of the stormwater detention permit application. Conversely, while lots within a subdivision that has received a stormwater management permit will ordinarily be covered by the subdivision permit, development of individual lots may require the installation of detention facilities and associated design features if the "maximum impervious area" exceeds the amount allowed by this article, if conditions in the receiving system are inadequate, or if other harmful effects are likely to occur in the absence of appropriate detention facilities. 
(d)  Stormwater management design shall be based upon and shall take into account,permitted uses, densities, lot sizes, and other relevant provisions of the city zoning ordinance. 
(e)  Modifications or exceptions to the design criteria set forth in this article may be approved by the city when strict application of the terms of the article would create a material hardship and would not serve the purposes of the chapter; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize any deviation from the terms of this article without approval of the city. 
(f)  Any material modification of any existing stormwater detention system shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this article. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-43; Ord. No. 1496, § 3, 11-13-2001) 
Sec. 113-227. - Detention facilities. 
(a)  General criteria. 
(1)  Detention facilities shall be located within the parcel limits of the project under consideration. 
(2)  Subsurface detention may be permitted with adequate verification of structural adequacy. 
(3)  No detention or ponding will be permitted within public road rights-of-way. 
(4)  Location of detention facilities immediately upstream or downstream of the project will be considered by special request if proper documentation is submitted with reference to practicality, feasibility, and proof of ownership or right-of-use of the area proposed. 
(5)  Any area susceptible to or designed as overflow by higher design intensity rainfall (ten-year frequency and above) shall be sodded or paved. 
(6)  Methods of detention such as seepage pits, French drains, etc., are discouraged. If such methods are proposed, confirmation of soils data, percolation, geological features, and other relevant data shall be submitted with the application. 
(b)  Control features. 
(1)  Detention facilities shall be provided with effective control structures. Plan view and sections of the structure with adequate detail shall be included in plans. 
(2)  Lowflow pipes shall not be smaller than eight inches in diameter to minimize maintenance and operating problems, except in parking lot and roof retention systems, for which the minimum size of openings shall be designed specifically for each condition. The lowflow pipe shall be provided with a bar-screen on a minimum 2:1 slope to reduce blockage by debris. 
(3)  The overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to accept the total peak runoff of the improved tributary area. 
(c)  Discharge systems. Sizing of the system below the control structure shall be for the total improved peak runoff tributary to the structure with no allowance for detention. 
(d)  Maintenance. 
(1)  Detention facilities, when required, are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation and/or grading and must be fully operational as soon as is practicable after vegetation is removed from the land. Silt and debris connected with early construction must be removed periodically from the detention area and control structures in order to maintain full storage capacity. 
(2)  Responsibility for maintenance of detention facilities shall remain with the property owner and the developer until such time as applicable escrows are released and the duty to permanently maintain the facilities has been transferred to and vested in trustees, officers, or other identified persons or entities by means of binding covenants, trust indentures, or like undertakings. The nature, content, and form of the instrument by which maintenance obligations are established shall be subject to the review and approval of the city and shall be enforceable by the city. The city shall have a lien on real property to the extent necessary to recover its costs in enforcing any maintenance obligation imposed upon the owner or developer or any successor thereto under the terms of this article. 
(3)  The city will not accept maintenance responsibility for detention facilities required under this article, and no action on the part of the city to enforce or remedy any violation of this article shall be deemed an assumption of responsibility or obligation to repair or maintain the facilities. 
(e)  Verification of adequacy. 
(1)  Adequacy of stormwater management design shall be supported by a written engineering analysis that shall be submitted to the city and that shall include, at a minimum, the following data: 
a.  Existing drainage area and peak flows to the detention facility; 
b.  Proposed drainage area and peak flows to the detention facility; 
c.  Inflow hydrograph for each design storm; 
d.  Outflow hydrograph for each design storm; 
e.  Storage elevation and discharge elevation calculations; 
f.  Required storage volume for each design storm; 
g.  Statement of methodology used for the detention facility design; 
h.  Routing calculations for each design storm; and 
i.  A downstream hydrologic assessment shall be made to a point where the drainage area controlled by the detention facility comprises ten percent of the total drainage area. For example, if the detention pond controls five acres, peak flows shall be checked downstream until the drainage area is 50 acres. 
(2)  For all projects, routing calculations shall be submitted in legible tabulated form. Proof of adequacy of volume of retention and sizing computations for low-flow structures shall also be submitted. Features of stability and safety may also need to be documented if the scope of the project requires special attention in this area of design. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-44; Ord. No. 1496, § 4, 11-13-2001; Ord. No. 1637, § 1, 6-28-2004)

The entire reservoir area shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded, or paved prior to release of surety if required by the city. Wet weather ponds or dry reservoirs shall be enclosed by fencing a minimum of six feet high, with one gate and lock provided. The applicant is encouraged to use a fencing material aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area and the development. 
(g)  Open channels. 
(1)  Normally permitted open channels may be used as detention areas, provided that the limits of the maximum ponding elevation are not closer than 30 feet horizontally from any buildings, and not less than two feet (vertically) below the lowest sill elevation of any building to be located on the parcel to be developed. No ponding will be permitted within public road rights-of-way. Maximum depth of detention in open channels shall be five feet. 
(2)  For trapezoidal sections, the maximum side slopes of the detention area of the channel shall not exceed one foot vertical for two feet horizontal (2:1). Safety, stability, and ease of maintenance shall be incorporated into channel section design. 
(3)  The entire reservoir area of the open channel shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded, paved, or lined prior to release of escrows. 
(4)  The hydraulic elevations resulting from channel detention shall not adversely affect adjoining properties. 
(h)  Permanent lakes. 
(1)  Permanent lakes with fluctuating volume controls may be used as detention areas, provided that the limits of maximum ponding elevations are no closer than 30 feet horizontally from any building and not less than two feet (vertically) below the lowest sill elevation of any building located on the parcel to be developed.

(3)  Maximum fluctuation from permanent pool elevation to maximum ponding elevation shall be three feet. 
(4)  Special attention should be given to safety considerations in designing permanent lakes in residential areas. 
(5)  Viability of the permanent impoundment shall be considered. Generally, the permanent pool should be no greater than one-tenth the size of the tributary drainage area. The minimum depth of at least 25 percent of the permanent pool area should be no less than eight feet. Allowances for silting under denuded soil conditions (during construction) for a period of at least one year is also recommended. 
(6)  The entire fluctuating area of the permanent reservoir shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded, or paved prior to release of surety if required by the city. Any area susceptible to or designed as overflow by higher design intensity rainfall (ten-year frequency) shall be sodded or paved. 
(i)  Parking lots. Detention is permitted in parking lots to a maximum depth of eight inches. In no case should the maximum limits of ponding be designed closer than ten feet from a building unless waterproofing of the building and pedestrian accessibility are properly documented. The minimum freeboard from the maximum ponding elevation to the lowest sill elevation shall be one foot.

(c)  Predesign conference. 
(1)  The applicant and the consulting engineer are encouraged to contact the city for a predesign conference at the conceptual stage of a project in order to clarify the application of this article to the development, address any questions, and minimize cost, delay, and inconvenience to the developer. 
(2)  Subsequent conferences during the preparation of plans may be arranged by the consulting engineer or the developer to obtain preliminary, informal decisions on items requiring clarification. 
(d)  Review fees. Each application for a stormwater detention permit shall include a nonrefundable fee as set forth in chapter 14. Should the actual, reasonable cost to the city for engineering or other technical review of the application exceed the amount set forth in chapter 14, the additional cost shall be paid by the applicant prior to issuance of the detention permit. 
(e)  Issuance of certificate. As soon as is practicable following submission of all materials required under this article and any additional material or information that may be required by the city, the city shall approve or disapprove in writing the application for a stormwater detention permit. Prior to issuance of a final decision on the application, the city may engage in informal discussions with the applicant that are aimed at resolving any matters that could ultimately impede or prevent approval of the permit. Conditional approval may be given, but should be reserved only for exceptional circumstances under which conditional approval would better serve the purposes of this article. 
(f)  Appeal of adverse decision. 
(1)  In the event favorable action is not taken on the application within 60 days of its filing, the applicant may appeal the city's adverse action (or its failure to act) in writing to the city planning commission. After setting the matter for hearing, the planning commission may review and determine any issue or matter made the basis of the appeal, but may condition its agreement to accept and decide any appeal on the applicant's agreement to pay for the cost of any additional testing or evaluation that the planning commission may reasonably require in connection with its review of the case. The planning commission may likewise review any decision to suspend or revoke any stormwater detention permit. 
(2)  All appeals must be made in writing, must specify the grounds for appeal, and must be accompanied by a payment as set forth in chapter 14 to cover the cost of additional processing and review. Appeals should be addressed to the attention of the city manager and must be received by the city manager within 30 days of the date of the written decision that is the basis of the appeal. 
(3)  Following a review of the appeal, the planning commission shall be authorized to sustain, reverse, or modify the decision from which the appeal is taken, or to grant such other relief, if any, as it believes to be warranted under the facts and circumstances, and with due regard to the applicable provisions of this article and the purposes sought to be served hereby. 
(4)  The planning commission shall decide any appeal presented to it within 90 days of its filing. The decision of the planning commission shall be in writing and shall be final, subject to any remedy at law or in equity that may be available to the applicant.

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 117-19. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-2; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 1, § B, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-20. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or that increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 1, 1980. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure, (note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  Means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be: 
a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
(2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 117-72. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-31; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 4, § A, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-73. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 117-72(4). 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any non-residential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 117-72(4). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: 
1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a minimum of 60 inches (five feet) to meet the state standard required by the state manufactured housing commission; 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer to section 117-72) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on it's wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and (3)c of this section. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 117-23, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-32; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 4, § B, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-74. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways (A-zones). 
(a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 117-23, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 117-23, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data is not available from these sources, then the following provisions in subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas, without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the state manufactured housing commission elevation requirements of section 117-73(3)b.2 in that the structure must be elevated a minimum of 60 inches (five feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 117-72(4). 
(b)  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-33; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 4, § C, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-75. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 117-23, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least five feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 117-72(4). The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two feet, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 117-48(b)(1)c and 117-48(b)(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-34; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 4, § D, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-76. - Standards for subdivisions.

(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less. 
(Code 1996, § 7.1-35; Ord. No. 1633, Art. 4, § E, 5-24-2004) 
Sec. 117-77. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of zoning adjustment (board) as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the circuit court of the county, if and to the extent decisions of the board are otherwise reviewable by courts of general jurisdiction under state law. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances shall be as follows: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state department of economic and community affairs/office of water resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(Code 1996, § 18.1-28; Ord. No. 1249, § 3, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-4. - Health, safety and general welfare objectives. 
    In considering whether to permit communication facilities to be constructed and/or installed at a certain location, the commission shall consider the following public health, safety and general welfare objectives: 
(1)  Structural safety of towers. Towers must comply with wind-load and other structural standards contained in applicable building and technical codes, as they may be amended and in effect from time to time, including, without limitation, the 1994 Standard Building Code and any amendments thereto or replacements thereof, all as adopted by the city council of the city, and the electronic industries associations code, so as not to endanger the health and safety of people in the event of the structural failure of a tower. The city's building inspection superintendent shall determine whether towers comply with the requirement of this subsection. 
(2)  Appearance of tower compounds. To the extent practicable, towers and tower compounds must be designed, through the use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping, so that their appearance is compatible with the surrounding land uses. The commission may require that planting and a decorative fence or a decorative wall be constructed around a tower compound to help accomplish this end. 
(3)  Compliance with rules and regulations. All communication facilities must comply with all applicable rules, regulations and other requirements of the FCC and any other governmental agencies having jurisdiction over them, including, but not limited to, rules and regulations of the state and the county health department regarding health matters. The commission may require that satisfactory evidence of such compliance be furnished to it. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-29; Ord. No. 1249, § 4, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-5. - Development criteria. 
    The city's building inspections superintendent or other designated official shall review all applications for permits for towers, antennas or equipment for compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the provisions of this section. By a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the commission who are present at the public hearing at which an application is considered, the commission may waive any one or more of the following requirements with respect to a particular tower and related antenna and equipment if the circumstances justify the waiver of such requirements, provided the reasons for such waiver are included in the minutes of the meeting of the commission at which such waiver was granted. 
(1)  Setbacks. When a tower compound is situated on residential property or is situated on a parcel of land that is contiguous to residential property, the centerline of the tower may not be located nearer than 100 feet from the boundary line of any lot or parcel of residential property. If the land on which a tower compound is located, and all land that is contiguous to the tower compound, is in a nonresidential zoning district (including land in a planned unit development district or a mixed use district that is used for nonresidential purposes), the centerline of the tower may not be located nearer than 50 feet from the boundary line of such contiguous property. The commission may reduce the forgoing setback requirements in exceptional cases where, due to unusual topographic conditions of the tower compound, the enforcement of such setback requirements would result in unnecessary hardships to the applicant; provided, that the minimum building required setback may not be reduced to less than the minimum setback required by the city's zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the tower compound is located and that the reduction of the setback requirements shall not, in the opinion of the commission, be contrary to the health, safety and general welfare of the public. 
(2)  Appearance and maintenance of towers. Towers must be constructed of wood, galvanized steel or concrete and retain their natural finish so as to reduce their visibility. Towers must be properly maintained. The estimated life of the tower, the antenna and the equipment must be included in the application for the construction or installation of such tower, antenna or equipment. 
(3)  Signs. No signs or other forms of advertising, including signs displaying the name of the owner or user of the tower or antenna, may be attached to, or depicted on, a tower or antenna. 
(4)  Lighting. Towers may not be artificially lighted. Lights for security and to assist in making emergency repairs may be installed on buildings that contain equipment. Such lights must be pointed in a downward direction from a height of not more than ten feet, and no such light may exceed a maximum of 150 watts. Such lights must be located and directed so that they do not shine or reflect onto or toward any residential property. 
(5)  Landscaped buffers. All tower compounds must be surrounded by a landscaped buffer, which shall, to a height of at least eight feet, effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways and residential property. The buffer, which may be located within the required setback area, shall consist of a landscaped strip, at least four feet in depth, located outside of the security fence. The buffer strip shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, vines and/or ground covers, which are capable of attaining, at maturity, a height as high as the security fence and which will enhance, and, at least, partially screen, the outward appearance of the security fence. For tower compounds located within 1,000 feet of residential property or areas of special aesthetic concerns, such as Crestline Village, English Village and Mountain Brook Village and schools, the commission may require wider landscaped buffer areas and other items, such as decay-resistant, solid wood fences, earth berms and brick or masonry walls in addition to the security fences and planting referred to hereinbefore. All fences, walls and landscaping shall be kept in good condition and repair and maintained in a neat manner by the owner or user of the tower. In the application for permission to construct a new tower or to install an additional antenna on an existing tower, the applicant must advise the city of the name and address of the party who shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities, and any fences, walls and landscaped buffer areas. If a different person becomes responsible for such maintenance and repair, the owner of the tower must give the city's building inspections superintendent written notice of such person's name and address. 
(6)  Alternative landscaping methods. In isolated, nonresidential areas, alternative landscaping methods for tower compounds, such as the use of a dark colored, vinyl-coated or galvanized steel chainlink security fence in combination with evergreen shrubs, trees, vines, and/or other plantings, may be permitted by the commission on the condition that if the areas surrounding such tower compounds become developed, the commission shall have the right to require the owner of the tower compound to comply with the landscaping requirements of subsection (5) of this section. 
(7)  Preservation of tower compound site. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on tower compound sites shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. In some cases, such as tower compounds located on large, wooded lots, preservation of a substantial amount of natural growth around the perimeter of the tower compound may be taken into consideration by the commission in determining the extent of the buffer required. 
(8)  Security devices. Each tower compound must be surrounded and fully secured by the installation of a dark colored, vinyl-coated or galvanized steel chain link security fence, at least eight feet in height, around the perimeter of the tower compound. Security fencing shall require screening in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. 
(9)  Size of tower compound. Each tower compound must be large enough to provide room for a structure to contain the equipment for at least one additional antenna. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-30; Ord. No. 1249, § 5, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-6. - Access. 
    A parking area with an all-weather surface must be provided for each tower compound. A driveway with an all-weather surface must be provided for each tower compound to provide adequate access to the tower compound for the maintenance and repair of the communication facilities and for vehicles providing emergency services. Subject to the approval of the commission and to an appropriate agreement with the owner thereof, access may be by means of, and parking may be provided on, an adjoining parcel of land. Subject to the approval of the commission, one or more public streets adjoining the tower compound may serve as the parking area. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-31; Ord. No. 1249, § 6, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-7. - Collocation. 
    A new tower may not be constructed if space is available, on an economically reasonable basis, on an existing tower that is structurally and technically able to support the antenna required to serve the area proposed to be served by such new antenna. An affidavit that reasonable efforts have been made by the applicant to locate the proposed antenna on an existing tower must be submitted with the application for the construction of a new tower. Such affidavit must comply with the provisions of section 126-10(a)(6). Each tower constructed must be designed to provide for the installation of additional antennas to the fullest extent practicable, taking into consideration the structural and technical limitations of the type of tower proposed to be constructed. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-32; Ord. No. 1249, § 7, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-8. - Removal of unused towers. 
(a)  Any tower that is no longer in use for its permitted purpose shall be removed at the owner's expense. 
(b)  Within ten days of sending notice to the FCC of the intent of the owner of a tower to cease use of the tower, the owner of the tower shall provide the city manager with a copy of such notice. 
(c)  The owner of the tower must remove the tower and all communication facilities used in connection with it within 90 days from the day the tower ceases to be used as a tower, or by such earlier date as may be required by the FCC. 
(1)  If the owner of the tower does not remove the tower from the tower compound within such 90-day period, or such shorter period as may be prescribed by the FCC, the owner of the land on which the tower is located (if a party different from the owner of the tower) must remove it from such land within 90 days of receiving written notice from the city to do so. 
(2)  If neither the owner of the tower nor the owner of such land removes the tower from the land within the time prescribed hereinbefore, the city may, but shall not be obligated to, remove the tower. 
(3)  If the city removes the tower it shall be entitled to recover the cost of doing so from the owner of the tower and/or the owner of the land upon which the tower is located. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tower that is used by more than one party may continue to be used for telecommunication purposes as long as the tower is used for such purposes by at least one party. Any party who ceases to use a tower used by more than one party shall remove its antenna from the tower and shall remove its equipment from the tower compound within 90 days after it ceases to use the tower (or within such shorter period as may be prescribed by the FCC) so that the tower and the tower compound will be available for use by another party or other parties. 
(e)  If the tower is located on property owned, or leased to the owner of the tower by, the city or the board of education of the city (board), the city or the board, respectively, shall have the right to purchase the tower for $100.00 when it ceases to be used for telecommunication purposes by the owner of the tower and by all other parties who have an antenna located on the tower. Such right to purchase must be exercised by the city or the board, respectively, within 60 days of the day the city receives notice that the owner of the tower intends to cease using the tower for its permitted purpose. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-33; Ord. No. 1249, § 8, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-9. - Receiving antennas. 
    A building permit will be required for receiving antennas over 18 inches in diameter. A receiving antenna located in a residential zoning district shall be considered to be, and treated as, an accessory structure. A receiving antenna located in any zoning district other than a residential zoning district must be screened on at least three sides if it is located on the roof of a building or on the top of any other structure, and it must be screened on four sides if it is located at ground level. 
(Code 1996, § 18.1-34; Ord. No. 1249, § 9, 1-27-1997) 
Sec. 125-10. - Camouflaged communications facilities and camouflaged support structures. 
(a)  Camouflaged communications facilities and camouflaged support structures shall be permitted in any zoning district subject to the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  The applicant bears the burden of clearly establishing that proposed communications facilities and support structures and the location thereof comport with the purpose, intent, and requirements of this section. 
(2)  Camouflaged communications facilities and support structures, including antennae, cabling, and other related equipment, shall be designed, built, colored, integrated, and located so as to be shielded or hidden from public view or to blend harmoniously and unobtrusively with surrounding structures, landscape, or environment. 
(3)  The desired camouflaging may be achieved by incorporating the facilities, structures, or equipment into existing or newly constructed buildings or structures, which buildings or structures may be multifunctional (e.g., a working streetlight supporting a communications antenna). 
(4)  All facilities, buildings, and equipment shall be appropriately secured for safety purposes. 
(5)  Approved camouflaged communications facilities shall be exempt from otherwise applicable setback requirements; camouflaged support structures that permit walk-in entry or that are six feet or more in height must satisfy otherwise applicable setback requirements. 
(6)  Regardless of size, and in conjunction with or in addition to other camouflaging measures, all support structures shall be located, screened, or landscaped as to eliminate or minimize their obtrusiveness and to otherwise serve the purposes of this chapter. 
(b)  A permit authorizing the construction, placement, or installation of a camouflaged communications facility or support structure may be issued by the city manager as soon as is practicable, provided that: 
(1)  The facility, structure, and related equipment are completely enclosed, housed, or incorporated into an existing structure or fixture so as to be totally shielded or hidden from public view; 
(2)  Other criteria as set forth in this chapter specifically applicable to camouflaged communications facilities and support structures have been satisfied; and 
(3)  Other applicable substantive criteria and conditions set forth in the city's general telecommunications ordinance that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter have been met. 
(c)  All applications for camouflaged communications facilities that do not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall be considered by the planning commission following notice and public hearing as prescribed by section 125-3.

(Ord. No. 1763, § 1(19-12-0), 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 129-192. - Permitted uses.

b.  Schools, public and private; 
c.  Municipal parking facilities. 
(b)  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are uses which may be acceptable within the Local Business District, based on specific circumstances and mitigating site design provisions that would eliminate the potential for these uses to otherwise have negative impacts on adjacent property, other uses in the district, or the district as a whole. Therefore, they require special review to better determine if the circumstances and design provisions for the proposed use when applied to a specific site are sufficient to mitigate any potential negative impacts. In addition to review of factors set forth in the following sections, any proposed conditional use will be reviewed as to the following: 
i  Whether the use would disparately impact public parking in the area; 
ii  Whether vehicular or pedestrian circulation would be impacted by the use; 
iii  Whether the use is compatible with surrounding existing uses; 
iv  Whether the hours of operation or peak traffic times would impact existing uses. 
The following conditional uses may be permitted in a Local Business District, but only with the prior written approval of the city council: 
(1)  Service uses shall be conditional uses in any area covered by a village master plan or the village overlay standards. The conditional review and approval process shall ensure that, in addition to the other factors of conditional review, sufficient parking exists so that the use will not negatively impact existing established businesses, and that the proposed service use, either in isolation or in conjunction with other service or office uses, will not have a detrimental impact on public parking in the villages. The service use category consists of businesses that offer customers services for the performance and delivery on premises, and may offer some limited products or merchandise associated with the service.

A service use so established or permitted may be replaced by another service use with the same or fewer required parking spaces, it being the intent of the council to permit the continued service use of properties where existing service uses are located without the need for specific approval if parking demand is not increased. However, should such service use be replaced with a retail use, then any future reestablishment of a service use in the same location will require prior written approval of city council per subsection (b) of this section. 
Any such conditional use shall be approved by the city council if all required parking is provided on site and in the quantities set forth in subsection 129-555(a) of this Code. 
(2)  Office uses shall be conditional uses in any area covered by a village master plan or the village overlay standards.

However, should such office use be replaced with a retail use, then any future reestablishment of an office use in the same location will require prior written approval of city council per subsection (b) of this section. 
Any such conditional use shall be approved by the city council if all parking is provided onsite and in the quantities set forth in subsection 129-555(a) of this Code.

Proposed uses shall present a forecasted parking demand during operating hours based on industry standards as part of the conditional review;

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1767, § 1, adopted Feb. 25, 2008, repealed the former Art. XIV, §§ 129-231-129-236, and enacted a new Art. XIV as set out herein. The former Art. XIV pertained to the Mixed Use District and derived from Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96; Ord. No. 1631, § 1, 5-10-04. 

Sec. 129-231. - Purpose and applicability. 
(a)  The Mixed Use District is designed to provide building sites and buildings that enhance the pedestrian atmosphere of the village by specifying how buildings can accommodate a mixture of general use types in a single structure, how they must address the public streetscape, and additional design elements of buildings that are required in order to preserve the existing character of the area. This district is intended for use only in specified areas of the villages where the benefits that can result from multiple uses in a single structure have been identified in the broader context of a village master plan or to other commercial areas whose design would emulate the village approach to development in terms of scale and design under the city master plan. 
    In determining whether the zoning classification of a parcel of land should be changed to a Mixed Use District, the city council may take into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate with respect to such parcel of land and the land adjacent to or near such parcel of land, which factors shall include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  The city master plan, a village master plan where applicable, or any special area plan and any applicable overlay standards for the area, and the recommendation of the planning commission regarding these plans and standards; 
(2)  The design guidelines of the village master plans and any recommendation of the design review committee regarding these guidelines; 
(3)  The then present use of the land and the improvements located thereon, the condition of such improvements; 
(4)  The then present use of the adjacent and nearby land and the improvements located thereon and the condition of such improvements; 
(5)  The proposed use of the parcel of land, whether new improvements will be constructed, whether existing improvements will be renovated, razed or left in their then present condition; 
(6)  The compatibility of the use of the land and its improvements with the use of the adjacent and nearby land and the improvements thereon; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use of the land and its improvements with the use of such adjacent and nearby land and improvements; and 
(8)  The benefits or detriments to the parcel of land, the adjacent and nearby land and the city which would result from the development of the land in accordance with the proposed development plan, unless approved as a base zoning district of a Planned Unit Development District pursuant to article XVI of this chapter. 
(b)  Property that was not zoned as a Mixed-Use District as of January 1, 2007 shall not be zoned or rezoned as a Mixed-Use District; provided, however, that the Mixed Use District may be utilized as a base zoning district of a Planned Unit Development District which is located within any village boundary line or shown on the building and development regulating plans included in article XXXI of this chapter.

ARTICLE XVI. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Sec. 129-261. - Purpose and applicability. 
(a)  General Purposes. The Planned Unit Development ("PUD") District is designed to permit flexible development of projects which are comprehensively planned as a single development with a functional master development plan which fully considers the entire site as an integrated project and gives broad consideration to impacts and relationships to surrounding areas. The PUD District permits flexibility in locating buildings, mixtures of building types and land uses, and open spaces. In permitting such flexibility, the city council should consider policies or goals in the city master plan and any village master plan approved by the planning commission, and other broad public benefits demonstrated in a master development plan. The planning commission or city council may attach conditions to a master development plan proposed for a PUD to safeguard the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. 
(b)  Specific purposes. Each master development plan for a proposed PUD District shall advance the following specific planning purposes: 
(1)  The plan should take into consideration policy statements identified in association with use of the PUD District as a future land use policy in an officially approved village master plan; and 
(2)  The plan shall encourage more efficient development and use of land which results in one or more of the following benefits to the general public that could not be gained under standard zoning districts, such as: 
a.  Reduced negative aesthetic and environmental impacts from buildings and site development facilities, including better management of or reduction in the environmental impacts of development on the surrounding community; 
b.  A better relationship between buildings, streetscapes, and public or common open spaces, resulting in an integrated community character that considers extensions and transitions to adjacent areas, as well as relationships to the particular characteristics of the site; 
c.  Less burden of traffic on streets, roads, and highways, including better pedestrian accommodations and connections; or 
d.  Exemplary design of buildings and civic spaces which reinforces and complements the existing character of surrounding areas. 
(c)  General applicability. The PUD District is generally applicable for master development plans that involve arrangements of two or more types of building types, lot types, or uses which could otherwise not be developed under a single zoning district, or where developments that may be allowed under a single zoning district represent exemplary design with public benefits that could not be achieved under the zoning district standards. In each case a master development plan shall be used to create a better arrangement of the buildings, lots, or uses than would otherwise be allowed under the base zoning district standards. However, each element of the site shall be based on a zoning district most closely associated with the building types and uses, and the master development plan shall demonstrate and identify where deviations from the standards of that district are necessary to achieve the goals of the master development plan and provide broader public benefits. 
(d)  Minimum acreage. The minimum contiguous acreage for a master development plan and application of the PUD zoning district shall be: 
(1)  Four acres for areas covered by an approved village master plan of the city and specifically identified for use of the PUD District as a future land use policy; or 
(2)  Twelve acres for areas not covered by an approved village master plan or a plan including areas not identified for use of the PUD as a future land use policy in such plan; or 
(3)  Two acres for areas designated as Highway 280 gateways. 
(e)  Highway 280 gateways. Properties eligible for a master development plan and application of PUD zoning district shall be: 
(1)  Property, located in whole or in part, in a primary or secondary gateway as designated on the Highway 280 gateway maps; 
(2)  Property for which the current use, as of the effective date of this amendment is non-residential. 
    The boundaries officially approved for the Highway 280 gateways, as specified above, are adopted herein by reference, and shall become a part of official zoning map of Mountain Brook as defined in section 129-17 of the zoning ordinance. 
    The gateway maps for Highway 280 are attached hereto, and are included within, and made a part of these planned unit development standards. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96; Ord. No. 1766, § 1(19-16-1), 2-25-2008; Ord. No. 1975 , § 1, 3-27-2017) 
Sec. 129-262. - Definitions. 
    As used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the following meaning: 
(1)  Applicant means the owner of the land proposed for a PUD or a designated representative of the owner. 
(2)  Common area means an area within a PUD designated and intended for the use and enjoyment of all residents of the PUD and under the common ownership and control of the owners of the property within the PUD. 
(3)  Developer means the owner of the parcel proposed to be developed as a PUD or a designated representative of the owner. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-263. - Permitted uses. 
    The PUD District shall be assembled using any of the base zoning districts provided in this chapter and approved by the city council. The permitted uses in the PUD District shall include any of the permitted uses of such base zoning district(s) used to assemble the master development plan. Final approval of any of the uses in the PUD District shall be contingent on submittal of the required master development plan and other materials, proper review of the same by the planning commission, and subsequent determination by the city council that the uses being proposed are appropriate and acceptable due to the arrangement, planning and design demonstrated in the master development plan. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96; Ord. No. 1766, § 1(19-16-3), 2-25-2008) 
Sec. 129-264. - Area and dimensional requirements. 
(a)  Spacing and setbacks of buildings and structures. The spacing, height and setback of buildings and structures, and the required parking and parking design requirements associated therewith, shall generally meet the standards of the applicable base zoning district(s) included in the master site plan. Modification from these requirements may be made through the proposed master development plan. The planning commission may recommend and the city council may approve arrangements that better meet the purposes of this district, the city master plan, or any applicable village master plan. Required parking for master development plans for property located in the Highway 280 gateways may utilize the provisions under subsection 129-555(b)(3). 
(b)  Density. The permitted number of dwelling units and building intensity in a PUD may not exceed the number which would otherwise be allowed in the base zoning district(s) which are used as a basis for the master development plan, though the city council may approve other densities that better meet the purposes of this district and any specific policies and goals of the city master plan and any applicable village master plan. In this regard, the PUD application shall be considered similar to a rezoning request to all of the districts that make up the basis of the master development plan. The burden of proof shall be on the developer to show that existing or proposed facilities and utilities can handle the requested intensity of development. 
(c)  Property development standards. Property development standards for a PUD shall be determined by the city council after receiving recommendations from the planning commission. The development of the PUD must be compatible with the topography of the parcel and must preserve any unusual topographic or natural features of the parcel. The development shall not adversely affect the developed or undeveloped property in the vicinity of the PUD, and the development must be compatible with such other property with regard to density, size of buildings, architectural style and type of use. The city council's determination as to whether the proposed development of the PUD is compatible with the neighboring properties with regard to the forgoing criteria shall be presumptively correct. Adequate water, sewer, streets, open spaces and other facilities and utilities must be available for the proposed PUD or there must be a definite proposal for making them available at the expense of a party other than the city. Depending upon the density of the proposed PUD and the type of uses proposed for the PUD, the city council may require such building setbacks for any front yards, side yards, or back yards, along with such buffers, walls, hedges, shrubs, trees, and other designed transitions as the city council deems necessary and appropriate for the preservation of the character of the other property in the vicinity of the PUD. The city council may impose such reasonable conditions, terms or limitations which it finds necessary or helpful for the protection and promotion of the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the city. 
(d)  Other regulations. All applicable regulations provided for elsewhere in this chapter, including minimum parking requirements and density standards, shall be in force except where the matters covered by such regulations are specifically addressed in this article. 
(e)  Master development plan. The proposed master development plan ("proposed plan") shall include the following information: 
(1)  The location and size of the parcel to be developed as a PUD, including its legal description and a current perimeter survey prepared and certified by a surveyor who is licensed as a surveyor by the state. The survey must show all streets which are adjacent to the parcel, all easements and rights-of-way on the parcel and the location of any existing buildings or other structures which shall be a part of the PUD. 
(2)  A vicinity map showing the parcel in relation to surrounding property and a general description of the surrounding area, including the current zoning and land uses of the surrounding area. 
(3)  A statement of the planning objectives to be achieved by the PUD. The statement should include a description of the proposed development and the rationale behind the assumptions and projections made by the applicant. 
(4)  The density of land use to be allocated to all parts of the PUD site, together with tabulations by acreage and percentage of the parcel to be occupied by each proposed use. 
(5)  The location, size, and character of all buildings, including identification of the base zoning district related thereto and contemplated use(s) of the building. If any proposed building does not meet the standards of the base zoning district associated with it, a description of the specific standards which are not met by the proposed building, a description of the deviations from those standards and the reasons why the deviations are necessary must be provided. 
(6)  The location, size and character of any common open space or any commonly owned facilities and the type or organization which will own and maintain any commonly owned open space or facilities. 
(7)  The number, location and layout of parking spaces and attendant driveways and other areas necessary for the maneuvering of motor vehicles. 
(8)  Means of access to and from the PUD site. 
(9)  Location and dimensions of any service yards. 
(10)  A landscaping plan. 
(11)  The outside appearance of any proposed buildings. 
(12)  Any signs for any proposed buildings. 
(13)  Materials with which parking areas, driveways and sidewalks will be covered. 
(14)  Storm drainage facilities. 
(15)  Plans for providing utilities. 
(16)  A computerized or physical three-dimensional scale model of the proposed site and all buildings showing the scale, massing, and relationship of the buildings to the site and topography, to streetscapes, to open spaces, and to adjacent properties from all relevant perspectives and showing all relevant dimensions. The applicant may submit the model in electronic format if the most recent version of Sketch-Up is used, otherwise, the application shall provide perspectives from all relevant angles and at least one for each side of the buildings.

(c)  Additional time for submission of documents, materials and information. Exceptions may be made regarding the time when the documents, materials and information required as part of an application for Planned Unit Development District zoning must be submitted in cases in which the subject parcel exceeds ten acres, or in cases in which the zoning officer determines, as a result of the preapplication conference, that there are special, unusual or unique circumstances which warrant such exceptions.

If there is an irreconcilable conflict between the requirements of the subdivision regulations and the requirements of this article, the requirements of this article shall be controlling. The master development plan must be approved prior to, or simultaneously with, the preliminary approval of the resurvey or subdivision plat. If the parcel has been resurveyed or subdivided prior to the approval of the master development plan, the parcel may have to be resurveyed to ensure the compatibility of the plat with the master development plan. 
(f)  Action on petition. Upon its consideration of the preliminary plan for a PUD at a public hearing, the planning commission may take action immediately; may, with the consent of the applicant, postpone taking action for no longer than 60 days to allow time for further review of materials; and/or may request changes or other modifications to the proposed PUD. If any such proposed PUD is determined by the planning commission to be unacceptable in terms of conforming with the purpose and intent of this article, as well as in consideration of the best interest of the area affected and the city as a whole, the reasons for such determination shall be set forth in the planning commission's recommendation to the city council for denial of the petition. Upon the planning commission's recommendation that a proposed PUD be approved by the city council, all materials, including the preliminary plan and any changes or modifications made thereto in the review and hearing processes, shall be considered binding on the subsequent development of the affected parcel while zoned as a Planned Unit Development District, unless any changes therein are approved in writing by the city council. 
(g)  Process for consideration of approval of PUD. For a PUD, the approval process shall comply with procedures set forth in article XXV of this chapter for a zoning amendment, except to the extent that the provisions of this article are inconsistent therewith, in which case such provisions of this article shall be controlling. Promptly after submission of a preliminary plan by the applicant, the city shall initiate the approval process by placing the proposed PUD on an agenda of the planning commission. After holding a public hearing on the application for such PUD rezoning, the planning commission shall prepare a report on the PUD and forward it to the city council, along with copies of the preliminary plan and related documents. Upon receipt of the planning commission's report, the preliminary plan and related documents, the city council shall schedule a public hearing as required by article XXV of this chapter and take appropriate action to approve, amend and approve, or disapprove the preliminary plan. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96; Ord. No. 1770, 4(19-16-5), 5-12-2008) 
Sec. 129-266. - Additional requirements and provisions. 
(a)  Deviation from the development plan. To facilitate minor adjustments to the approved master development plan as may be required by engineering or other circumstances unforeseen at the time of its approval by the city council, the zoning officer is authorized to approve alterations to the final master development plan which, in his opinion, are incidental or minor in scope. 
The following changes, which shall be considered major in scope and which may not be approved by the zoning officer, shall be subject to the review of the planning commission, and may be authorized by the planning commission, but only after their review thereof: 
(1)  Changes in density, open space, amount of land used for a certain purpose, or change in the size of a lot within the PUD by not more than five percent; 
(2)  Changes in the size of any building or structure by not more than five percent; 
(3)  Changes in the location of any building or structure by not more than five feet in any direction; provided that no such change referred to in the foregoing subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) may permit: a. Greater density than, or a structure larger than, that which could have been permitted by the city council in its consideration of the preliminary plan, or b. A use which was not approved by the city council in its consideration of the preliminary plan. 
(4)  All other changes in the PUD or the master development plan must be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to the initial approval of the PUD. The planning commission shall have the right to require further review, an additional public hearing or complete reapplication regarding any changes, including those listed above, which may, in the opinion of the planning commission, substantially alter the concept of the PUD as originally approved. 
(b)  Violation of plan. Any deviation from the master development plan which is not approved in accordance with subsection (a) above shall constitute a violation of the ordinance establishing that Planned Unit Development District and will subject the developer to the procedures and penalties set forth in this chapter. 
(c)  Failure to begin construction. Construction of the approved development must begin within one year from the date of the approval of the master development plan by the city council. Any approved changes in the plan shall not extend the time at which said one-year period begins to run. The planning commission may, no sooner than 60 days prior to the end of said one-year period, upon the written request of the applicant, extend such one-year period for a period of not more than six months if, in the judgment of the planning commission, such additional time is warranted. In any event, the construction of the PUD must be started within one year and six months of the approval of the master development plan by the city council and must be completed within the period of time determined by the city council for each PUD (the "completion period"), subject to extension by the planning commission, as provided hereinafter. If the planning commission extends the date by which construction of the PUD must be started, it may, but it shall not be obligated to, extend the completion period for the PUD by a period of time which may be less, but may not be greater, than the length of time by which the commencement date was extended. Failure to begin the development of the PUD within said one-year period, or the period as extended, or to complete the development within the completion period, or the extended completion period, shall automatically void the master development plan, and the zoning classification shall automatically revert to the zoning classification in effect for such parcel prior to its being rezoned a Planned Unit Development District. No building permit shall then be issued (except a permit for a building which would be in compliance with such prior zoning classification) until a new master development plan has been resubmitted and approved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article for an initial submission and approval. The development of a PUD shall be considered to be complete when the land has been resurveyed or subdivided in accordance with the subdivision regulations of the city (if such resurvey or subdivision is required), the subdivision plat has been recorded in the office of the Judge of Probate of Jefferson County, Alabama, the installation of all utilities which are to be used in the PUD has been completed (except for service lines to individual dwelling units), all required streets (public or private), curbs, gutters and sidewalks have been installed in the PUD and the final coat of paving has been placed on all streets in the PUD. 
(d)  Development in phases. If a PUD is to be constructed in stages, the construction of the first stage must begin within one year from the date of the approval of the master development plan by the city council, and each additional stage must begin not later than the construction commencement date for each such stage as provided for in the development schedule approved by the city council. In all cases, progress towards completion of the development should proceed in accordance with said development schedule. Failure to comply with this provision shall constitute a deviation from the master development plan, and the provisions and procedures of this section shall apply accordingly. 
(e)  When the PUD application is filed, a processing fee, as provided for in section 19-471(c), must be paid to the zoning officer, and the applicant shall provide the city with 17 copies of the preliminary plan and attendant documents and information. During the time the preliminary plan is under consideration by the planning commission, the applicant shall furnish the zoning officer with 17 copies of any revisions of the preliminary plan. During the time the preliminary plan or the master development plan is under consideration by the city council, the applicant shall furnish the zoning officer with 15 copies of any revisions of the preliminary plan or the master development plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, one or more lots and a part of an additional, contiguous lot ("divided lot") may be resurveyed into one lot if all of such property is owned by the same party or parties ("owner") and the owner does not own the remainder of the divided lot ("remainder"). When the owner files his application for approval of the resurvey he must provide the city clerk with satisfactory proof that the owner of the remainder ("remainder owner") has been given notice of the proposed resurvey and an opportunity to include the remainder and a contiguous lot or lots owned by the remainder owner in the resurvey, at the expense of the remainder owner. The remainder owner may, at his expense, become a party to the resurvey and include the remainder and such contiguous lot or lots in the resurvey as one resurveyed lot. If the remainder owner does not include the remainder and a contiguous lot or lots owned by him in the resurvey, the remainder shall not be considered a lot for the purposes of this chapter unless it complies with all of the requirements of this chapter with respect to the zoning district in which it is located, including, without limitation, the minimum area requirement and the minimum street frontage requirement. If the remainder does qualify as a lot, as provided hereinbefore, any improvements built on it must comply with the requirements of this chapter with respect to the zoning district in which it is located, including, without limitation, the building setback requirements and the maximum building area requirement. If the remainder is located in a Residence A District, it shall not be considered a preexisting lot for the purposes of section 129-35 (a)(1) of the City Code. 
(b)  Determination of size of parcel. With regard to all districts, only land which is located within the corporate limits of the city may be taken into account in determining whether a parcel satisfies the minimum required area of the parcel.

(2)  At or near the intersection of a public street, road, or thoroughfare and a private roadway or driveway; or 
(3)  Elsewhere in a public road right-of-way such that the sign, hedge, planting, wall, post, or other fixture or structure obstructs, interferes with, impairs, or denies the driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection or entering the roadway a clear view of all other vehicular traffic approaching the driveway or approaching the intersection or roadway from other intersecting streets, roads, or thoroughfares. 
(b)  A sign, hedge, planting, wall, post, or other fixture or structure shall presumptively be deemed to violate the foregoing prohibition if, from a vantage point three and one-half feet above the road or driveway surface at the "stop bar" or point of entry to the intersection or roadway, a clear view of traffic approaching the driveway or approaching the intersection or roadway from other intersecting streets cannot be achieved for a minimum distance (in units of feet) equal to the posted, advisory, or statutory speed limit (in units of miles per hour) multiplied by ten. 
(c)  Prior to initiating any civil or criminal action to enforce the terms of this section, the city shall endeavor to secure voluntary compliance with the requirements hereof; provided, however, that this provision shall be deemed precatory and directory in nature and effect, and shall not be a precondition or bar to such enforcement action or to invocation of any remedy otherwise available to the city.

(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-352. - Minimum parking space required for newly established uses. 
    On any parcel on which any new use is hereafter established, a minimum amount of space for offstreet parking for motor vehicles must be provided as set forth in the use regulations of the district in which such parcel is located, except as otherwise provided in subsection 129-194(d). 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-353. - Minimum parking space requirements for dwellings units. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the use regulations of the applicable zoning district, the following minimum amounts of space for offstreet motor vehicle parking shall be provided on any parcel hereafter used as follows: 
(1)  Single-family dwelling: 324 square feet; 
(2)  Dwellings for two or more families: 324 square feet for each dwelling unit.

Sec. 129-354. - Minimum parking space requirements for places of assembly. 
    For each theater, auditorium, church or other building designed to attract an assembly of persons at scheduled times, there shall be a minimum of one parking space for motor vehicles, which parking space shall contain at least 162 square feet and shall be not less than nine feet in width and 18 feet in length, for every three seats provided in the largest area of assembly in such building. If it is proposed that the building be enlarged or otherwise modified so that the largest area of assembly therein, whether the original largest area of assembly or another area, will contain more seats than were in the largest area of assembly in the building as originally constructed, no building permit may be issued for enlargement or modification unless the owner of such building presents satisfactory proof to the zoning officer that upon the completion of such enlargement or modification of the building there will be a sufficient number of parking spaces to satisfy the above stated requirements for parking spaces for the building as enlarged or otherwise modified. If any such building contains more than one area of assembly which is as large as, or approximately as large as, the largest area of assembly, such as a multi-theatre movie complex, then the minimum number of required parking spaces shall be based on all of such areas. All such parking spaces and such attendant driveways and other areas which may be necessary for the maneuvering of motor vehicles shall be arranged so as to provide convenient access to and from a paved street or alley. All parking spaces, driveways and maneuvering areas shall be paved with asphalt or concrete. All such areas shall have adequate storm drainage facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-355. - Exceptions to minimum parking requirements. 
    If the number of parking spaces for vehicles required hereinbefore cannot reasonably be provided on the same parcel on which the principal use is permitted, appeal may be made to the board of zoning adjustment ("board") to allow the additional required parking spaces ("additional parking spaces") to be located on other property; provided, that all such additional parking spaces must be within 500 feet of the main entrance of the building containing such principal use, and such other property shall be specifically designated for parking for such principal use and thereafter such additional parking spaces may not be reduced in number or used for any purpose other than parking spaces for such principal use unless the board determines that under the circumstances of a particular case it would be reasonable for some or all of such additional parking spaces to be used at certain times by one or more additional parties and the reasons for such exception are included in the minutes of the meeting of the board at which the request is considered. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the principal use requiring additional parking spaces is a church or synagogue ("place of worship"), the place of worship may file a written application with the board requesting the approval by the board of a plan providing that some, but not more than half, of the additional parking spaces may be located on private property other than the premises of the place of worship ("offsite parking plan"). The place of worship must enter into a contract with the owner of such private property ("private property"), which contract must contain all of the terms, conditions and other provisions relating to the right of the parishioners of the place of worship to park motor vehicles on the private property ("contract"). A copy of the contract must be included with the application filed with the board by the place of worship. The form of the contract shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney. The contract and the offsite parking plan shall be subject to the approval of the board. The offsite parking plan must provide: (1) that the private property on which the offsite parking spaces are to be located is within two miles of the main entrance of the place of worship; and (2) for arrangements, satisfactory to the board, by which the place of worship will transport its parishioners who park their motor vehicles on the private property from the private property to the place of worship and from the place of worship back to the private property. The details of the offsite parking arrangements for the place of worship shall be included in the minutes of the meeting of the board at which the request is considered and a copy of the contract and the offsite parking plan shall be attached to, and made a part of, such minutes. If the contract is terminated by the owner of the private property, the place of worship shall have a period of 90 days from the date it receives notice of such termination within which to: (1) enter into a contract under the terms of which the required additional parking spaces shall be located on another parcel of private property; and (2) submit to the board a copy of such contract and an offsite parking plan with respect to such other parcel of private property, which offsite parking plan must satisfy the same conditions, and shall be subject to the same procedures, as the procedures, as the original offsite parking plan of the place of worship. The form of such contract shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney, and the contract and the offsite parking plan shall be subject to the approval of the board. The board shall retain continuing jurisdiction over all such offsite parking arrangements for places of worship approved by the board and may require a representative of any such place of worship to appear before the board, from time to time, at the behest of the board, to report to the board about such parking arrangements, and the board shall determine whether such parking arrangements are working in a satisfactory manner, particularly, with respect to whether public streets adjacent to or near such place of worship are being used by its parishioners for parking. If, at any time, after having given the place of worship, and any interested parties who request that they be permitted to address the board, an opportunity to appear before, and address, the board, the board determines that the offsite parking arrangements approved by the board for such place of worship are not working in a satisfactory manner for the benefit of the place of worship and the residents of the property adjacent to and near the place of worship, the board may revoke the right of the place of worship to have the parking spaces on the private property included in the parking places necessary to satisfy the requirements for parking spaces provided for in section 129-195, or the board may modify, or place certain conditions on, such right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the principal use requiring additional parking spaces is a place of worship, neither offsite parking spaces which are located within 500 feet of the main entrance of the place of worship and which the place of worship has a nonexclusive right to use, nor parking spaces located on private property located within one mile of the main entrance of such place of worship may be taken into consideration to satisfy a requirement for additional parking spaces created by an expansion of the largest area of assembly in the place of worship which expansion occurs after the date of this section. If the board approves offsite parking arrangements for a place of worship, in accordance with the provisions of this section, which relate to a parcel of land on which, or which relate to one or more proposed buildings, existing buildings or additions to existing buildings for which, the planning commission has approved a nonresidential use in a Residence A District, a Residence B District, a Residence C District or an Estate Residence District, the place of worship which received the planning commission's approval of the nonresidential use shall not be required to resubmit to the planning commission the place of worship's proposal for such nonresidential use even if the parking arrangements approved by the board are different from, or inconsistent with, parking arrangements approved by the planning commission or parking arrangements made a condition to the planning commission's approval of such nonresidential use.

(a)  Screening required. Parking areas for multi-family residential use (other than duplexes) and for any professional, business or commercial uses which are located adjacent to dwelling units (including multi-family residential units) located on other parcels shall have a privacy fence, wall or buffer which will substantially prevent the lights of motor vehicles from shining on such adjacent dwelling units. The installation and maintenance of the privacy fence, wall or buffer shall be the responsibility of the owner of the parking area. The fence, wall or buffer shall be subject to the prior written approval of the planning commission, which may require such reasonable information about the proposed fence, wall or buffer which it considers necessary. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, with the prior written approval of the planning commission, the height of such fence or wall may exceed four feet. 
(b)  Screening requirements. In cases where a privacy fence, wall or buffer is required for the purpose of shielding residential uses or areas from parking areas, the following minimum requirements shall apply: 
(1)  The fence or wall shall be of solid, opaque permanent construction; 
(2)  Any such fence, wall, or buffer shall be maintained in perpetuity by the owner of the parking area being screened; and 
(3)  The shielding effect created shall be no less than 80 percent opaque when viewed horizontally from between two feet and five feet above the average ground level of the adjacent residential area or areas. 
The requirement for screening shall be waived within 40 feet of any entrance to, or exit from, such parking area to provide adequate view for, and of, pedestrians, vehicular traffic and the motorists entering and leaving the parking area.

b.  The aggregate number of hours worked at the residence by any such person as an employee of the home occupation may not exceed 40 hours during any calendar week; and, 
c.  Reserved. 
(q)  No sign or other item advertising, giving notice of, or in any way relating to, a home occupation may be placed in the yard of a residence, on the outside of a dwelling or accessory structure, or within a dwelling or accessory structure so as to be visible from outside such dwelling or accessory structure.

(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-435. - Amendment procedure. 
    After an application for rezoning has been determined to contain all of the required materials and information, the application will be submitted to the planning commission for consideration. The planning commission will hold a public hearing, after giving notice, as permitted by applicable law, of its consideration of the rezoning application. Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall forward to the city council its recommendation with respect to the proposed rezoning. After receiving the recommendation from the planning commission, the city council shall also give notice as permitted by applicable law and hold a public hearing to consider the proposed rezoning, after which the city council will take action on the proposed amendment. 
    If the city council determines that a proposed rezoning may be appropriate, but that the preliminary site plan and/or other information submitted to the city is not sufficient, the city council may: 
(1)  Postpone further consideration of the proposed rezoning to a later meeting to provide a reasonable opportunity for the applicant to submit a properly detailed final site plan and/or other information in proper form; or 
(2)  Refer the proposed rezoning to the planning commission for further consideration. 
(Ord. No. 1224, 2-26-96) 
Sec. 129-436. - Time limit. 
(a)  If the city council denies an application for an amendment to this chapter, another application for the same amendment to this chapter ("subsequent application") shall not be considered by the planning commission or the city council until two years have elapsed from the date on which the application was denied by the city council or, if the application is withdrawn by the applicant prior to the city council making a decision with respect to such application, but after the planning commission made a recommendation to the city council with respect to such application, until two years have elapsed from the date on which the planning commission made its recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within less than two years from the date on which an application for an amendment to this chapter was denied by the city council or, if the application is withdrawn by the applicant prior to the city council making a decision with respect to such application, but after the planning commission made a recommendation to the city council with respect to such application, within less than two years from the date on which the planning commission made such recommendation, the city council, by a resolution adopted by its members, may request the planning commission to make a recommendation to the city council with respect to, a subsequent application and, after receiving such recommendation from the planning commission, consider the subsequent application. 
(b)  If the city council denies an application for a change in the zoning classification of a parcel, another application for the same change in the zoning classification of the parcel, or any part of such parcel, shall not be considered by the planning commission or the city council until two years have elapsed from the date on which the application is denied by the city council or, if the application is withdrawn by the applicant prior to the city council making a decision with respect to such application, but after the planning commission made a recommendation to the city council with respect to such application, until two years have elapsed from the date on which the planning commission made its recommendation. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above, if the decision of the city council to grant an application for a change in the zoning classification of a parcel is challenged in the Jefferson County Circuit Court ("circuit court") and if the final judicial determination is that such application will not be granted, regardless of whether such decision is made by the circuit court or by an appellate court to which the decision of the circuit court is appealed, another application for the same change in the zoning classification of the parcel, or any part of such parcel, shall not be considered by the planning commission or the city council until two years have elapsed from: (i) the date on which the decision or order of the court, whether it be the circuit court or an appellate court, is final and the time for appeal, or further appeal, has expired; or (ii) the date on which such legal proceeding is dismissed if it is dismissed prior to a final judicial determination being made with respect to such application. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above, if the decision of the city council to deny an application for a change in the zoning classification of a parcel is challenged in the circuit court and if the final judicial determination is that such application will not be granted, regardless of whether such decision is made by the circuit court or by an appellate court to which the decision of the circuit court is appealed, another application for the same change in the zoning classification of the parcel, or any part of such parcel, shall not be considered by the planning commission or the city council until five years have elapsed from: (i) the date on which the decision or order of the court, whether it be the circuit court or an appellate court, is final and the time for appeal, or further appeal, has expired; or (ii) the date on which such legal proceeding is dismissed if it is dismissed prior to a final judicial determination being made with respect to such application. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) above, the city council may consider an application for a proposed change in the zoning classification of a parcel, or any part of the parcel, which, under subsection (b), subsection (c) or subsection (d) above was not to have been considered within the respective two-year periods referred to in said subsections (b) and (c) or within the five-year period referred to in said subsection (d), after receiving from the planning commission a recommendation with respect to such proposed rezoning of the parcel; provided, that prior to the consideration of the proposed change in the zoning classification of such parcel, or any part of such parcel, by the planning commission: (i) the city council determines that, because of reasons which would be proper for the city council to consider with respect to the proposed change in the zoning classification of the parcel, or such part of the parcel, it would be appropriate for the city council to consider changing the zoning classification of the parcel, or such part of the parcel, at such time; and (ii) the city council adopts a resolution providing that it has made such determination. 
(f)  If an application for a change in the zoning classification of a parcel is filed with the city clerk and: (i) at any time prior to the city council's consideration of the application at a meeting of the city council, the city council determines that the application is one which, under subsection (d) above, is not to be considered by the planning commission or the city council until the expiration of the five-year period referred to in said subsection (d); (ii) the city council does not make the determination and adopt the resolution referred to in subsection (e) above; and (iii) two years have elapsed from the date on which the decision or order of the court referred to in subsection (d) above is final and time for appeal, or further appeal, has expired or two years have elapsed from the date on which the legal proceeding referred to in subsection (d) above is dismissed if it is dismissed prior to a final judicial determination being made with respect to the application which was the basis for such legal proceeding, the city council may, by a resolution adopted by its members, agree to consider the application on the conditions that the applicant agree in writing that: (i) if the city council denies the application to change the zoning classification of the parcel and the applicant challenges such decision of the city council in the circuit court, the applicant shall be obligated to reimburse the city for the costs incurred by the city in defending such challenge (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and fees and expenses of expert witnesses) (collectively, "costs") if the final court order with respect to such decision of the city council, whether it be the order of the circuit court or a decision of an appellate court, shall uphold the city council's decision to deny the application to change the zoning classification of the parcel; and (ii) that the applicant post a bond in an amount which the city council determines will be sufficient to reimburse the city for the costs ("bond"). The bond must be issued by a bonding company which is licensed by the state as a bonding company and is qualified to do business in the state, and which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the city. Neither the planning commission nor the city council shall institute its consideration of the application until the bond has been posted with the city. If the applicant agrees to reimburse the city for the costs but objects to the amount of the bond, as determined by the city council, or objects to the city's determination that a bonding company proposed by the applicant is not acceptable, the applicant may, within 15 days of the date the amount of the bond is determined by the city council, file a petition with the city clerk requesting that the municipal court of the city ("municipal court") determine the amount of the bond, and/or approve the bonding company proposed by the applicant for the issuance of the bond. The municipal court shall hold a hearing on such petition within 30 days of the date the petition is filed with the city clerk. At the hearing the applicant and the city may present evidence with respect to the reasonableness of the amount of the bond as determined by the city council and with respect to whether the bonding company proposed by the applicant should be acceptable to the city. In determining the amount of the bond, the municipal court may take into consideration the amount of the costs of litigation incurred by the city in the litigation with respect to the prior application for the rezoning of such parcel or a larger parcel of which such parcel is a part. After consideration of all evidence presented, the municipal court shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, determine the, issues raised by the applicant in his petition with respect to the amount of the bond and/or the city's disapproval of the bonding company proposed by the applicant.

a.  The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to such building or land and do not apply generally to other buildings or land in the vicinity; 
b.  The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant; 
c.  The condition from which relief or a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant; and 
d.  The authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, will not increase noise or the danger of fire or otherwise imperil the public safety or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets or the risk of flooding or water damage, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area and will not in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort, morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the city; and

b.  The determination of the proper district applicable to a particular parcel in cases of ambiguity or doubt arising from a difference between the streets as existing and established on the ground and the street layout as shown on the zoning map; 
c.

ARTICLE XXVIII. - RESIDENTIAL INFILL DISTRICT 

Sec. 129-491. - Intent and purpose. 
    The residential infill district is an "overlay" district that is designed to promote the highest and best use of residential real estate by permitting the cost-effective development or redevelopment of residential property in limited areas within the city, under carefully controlled conditions, and in ways that will serve the purpose of the zoning ordinance without compromising the unique character of the residential districts within the city. More particularly, the creation of a "residential infill" zoning classification serves the following purposes: 
(1)  To permit additional, high-quality residential land use and development options for "transitional" zones between existing commercial and/or business uses and residential districts, the effect of which would be to maintain the residential character of existing residential districts while simultaneously discouraging objectionable nonresidential encroachment into such districts; 
(2)  To permit and promote the coordination and integration of compatible uses, architectural styles, and functional considerations between designated "village districts" within the city and surrounding residential neighborhoods; 
(3)  To encourage desirable development or redevelopment within the "village districts" by enhancing pedestrian access to and patronage of shops, stores, restaurants, and service establishments within such districts; 
(4)  To maintain or enhance the fair market value of residential property within the city; 
(5)  To serve the foregoing objectives, the purposes of the zoning ordinance, and the purposes of the city's master plan by permitting the full and effective use of land through modification of, flexible application of, or exemption from otherwise applicable zoning requirements, but with imposition of site-specific requirements and restrictions that are designed and intended to ensure appropriate use and development of the property. 
(Ord. No. 1526, § 1, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 129-492. - Permitted uses.

(a)  Minimum site area: None. 
(b)  Maximum density: Regarding the development taken as a whole, the average lot size shall be 6,000 square feet of land area; however, the city may require lower densities to achieve compatibility with the nature, density, and character of surrounding property. 
(c)  Minimum yards, setbacks, and building separation: No structure shall be located closer than ten feet from any adjacent residential property; provided, however, that the city may require additional setback area, buffers, greenbelts, or other landscape feature to achieve compatibility with the nature, density, and character of surrounding property. All buildings shall be located so as to conform to the Southern Standard Building Code and the Standard Fire Prevention Code, both as may be adopted and amended by the city. 
(d)  Minimum lot frontage on a public street: None; however, all lots shall either adjoin a public street or have access to a public street via a recorded easement or a private right-of-way. 
(e)  Maximum building height: Two and one-half stories or 371/2 feet, provided that a lower building height may be mandated in order to achieve the purposes of this article.

(d)  Title to property. All common areas, such as private streets, driveways, parks, recreational facilities, planted or forested areas, and all other improved or unimproved real property and improvements shall be privately owned, and title thereto may be held by a trustee for the benefit of the residents of such development, by a private corporation, by an association of the residents thereof, or as undivided interests owned by the owners of the lots within such development.

The approval process shall comply both with procedures set forth in article XXV of this chapter for a zoning amendment and any additional procedure required by this article. After submission of a master development plan by the applicant, the proposed residential infill development shall be placed on an agenda of the planning commission for consideration. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the residential infill zoning application and make a recommendation to the city council thereupon in accordance with article XXV, section 129-431, of this Code. The commission may consider all factors allowed by law in making its recommendation and should specifically consider the compatibility of the project with surrounding property, the impact of the project on surrounding uses, the conformity of the project with the objectives of the city's master plan, and the purposes of the residential infill district. 
(c)  Review by and final action by the city council. Following action on the rezoning application by the planning commission, the commission shall forward its recommendation and any accompanying report on the application to the city council, along with the proposed master development plan and any related documents. After providing notice of the proposed rezoning and a public hearing thereupon in the manner provided by the Code and by applicable law, the city council may approve the rezoning request (with accompanying master plan) as submitted, approve the rezoning request conditionally, amend and approve the rezoning request, or deny the rezoning request. In reviewing and acting on the rezoning request, the city council may consider any permitted by law, and specifically the compatibility of the project with surrounding property, the impact of the project on surrounding uses, the conformity of the project with the city's master plan, and the purposes of the residential infill district. In approving any application for residential infill zoning, the city council may impose such terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations as it deems reasonable, appropriate, and necessary to meet the objectives of this article or to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the city. 
(d)  Binding effect of approved master development plan. The master development plan that is required to be submitted with an application for zoning or rezoning shall be deemed an integral and essential element of any zoning or rezoning approved hereunder; and the plan, if and as modified and approved by the city council, shall be binding on the property and any subsequent development thereof unless and until the property is subsequently rezoned or modified in the manner prescribed by law; provided, however, that in order to accommodate such minor adjustments to the approved master development plan as may be required by engineering or other circumstances unforeseen at the time of its approval by the city council, the city's zoning officer is authorized to approve alterations to the master development plan which, in his opinion, are incidental or minor in scope, and which maintain the intent and character of the approved master development plan; further provided that, as an overlay district, approval of a residential infill zoning classification shall not preclude use or development of property that is permitted under its underlying zoning classification.

(3)  Recognize that different lot standards are appropriate for different building types; 
(4)  Promote public and private development that enhances public streetscapes and frames public streetscapes with appropriate scaled buildings, with proportions and massing that create a pedestrian scale on each site; 
(5)  Create compatible scale and heights of individual buildings on adjacent sites which may have a different amount of stories; 
(6)  Promote a consistent scale and proportion throughout the village based upon the relationship of buildings to immediately adjacent buildings, the relationship of buildings to the streetscape and opposing buildings, and the relationship of buildings to transition areas outside of the village; 
(7)  Animate the public streetscapes with pedestrian activity by promoting transparency of buildings; and 
(8)  Establish standards that achieve the above objectives based on the context and street designs associated with a development site. 
(b)  Standards. Permitted building types shall meet the following building standards, which standards shall control over any conflicting standard of the base zoning district (with the exception of any permitted use on lots zoned Vine Street Transitional (VST) District): 












(c)  Building height exceptions.

(5)  Drive-through facilities. Drive-through facilities may be permitted only where ingress and egress is provided from a secondary or access street as identified in the master plan. 
(6)  Waiver. A waiver of these access limitations may be granted by the city council if it is based on an overall circulation plan for a development site and supported by a technical study that considers vehicle and pedestrian circulation comprehensively, including all blocks in the surrounding area and the village as a whole. 
(e)  Sidewalk standards. Any development fronting on streets that do not currently have sidewalks shall include sidewalks in association with the site development according to the following:

1.  An inappropriate design of the right-of-way and site according to sound urban design, planning, or landscape principles; 
2.  A detriment to general public safety; or 
3.  Excessive construction costs due to extreme and unusual topography or other site conditions. 
b.  The inability to meet the standards is due to unique conditions of the site; and 
c.  The degree of exception granted by the city council is the minimum necessary to result in an appropriate design of both the site and right-of-way on which the site fronts, and will not be detrimental to general transportation patterns along the street and through the village.
