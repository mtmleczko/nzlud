(A) It is the public policy of the city to provide
all of its citizens equal opportunity for education,

accommodations, and acquisition through purchase or
rental of real property including but not limited to
housing, and to eliminate segregation or separation
based on race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation,

and equality of opportunity and is a burden to the
objectives of the public policy of the city, and shall be
considered as discriminatory practices. The
promotion of equal opportunity without regard to race,
religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, national origin, ancestry, or handicap is the
purpose of this subchapter.
(C) It is also the public policy of the city to
protect employers, labor organizations, employment
agencies, property owners, real estate brokers,

charges of discrimination.

policy of the city and an unlawful practice to induce or
attempt to induce any person to sell or rent or not to

identity, national origin, ancestry, or handicap.

§ 33.43 POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Commission shall have the following powers
and duties:
(A) To establish and maintain a permanent office
in the city.
(B) To create subcommittees and advisory
committees as in its judgment will aid in effectuating
the purpose of this subchapter.
(C) To issue such publications and such results
of investigation and research as in its judgment will
tend to minimize or eliminate discrimination because

(D) To initiate or receive charges of
discriminatory practices or complaints, except that no
commissioner who initiates a complaint may
participate as a member of the agency in the hearing
or disposition of the complaint.
(1) On the request of the complainant, the
Commission or staff shall aid the complainant in
drafting the complaint. To be acceptable to the
Commission, a complaint shall be sufficiently
complete so as to reflect properly the name and
address of the complainant, the name and address of
the respondent against whom the complaint is made,
the alleged discriminatory practice and a statement of
particulars thereof, the date and places of the alleged
discriminatory practice; if it is of a continuing nature,
the dates between which the continuing acts of
discrimination are alleged to have occurred, and a
statement as to any other action, civil or criminal,
instituted in any other forum based on the same
grievance as is alleged in the complaint, together with

(2) No complaint shall be valid unless filed
within 180 days from the occurrence of the alleged
discriminatory practice, or from the date of the
termination of a published and meaningful grievance
procedure provided by a respondent employer or labor
union, provided, that complaints filed only with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be
deemed to have been filed simultaneously with the
Commission for purposes of measuring the 180 day
limitation, as long as the complaint is otherwise within
the Commission’s jurisdiction, provided, further, that
the Commission shall have no jurisdiction over the
state or any of its agencies.
(E) To receive and investigate charges of
discriminatory practices or complaints.
(1) All investigations of complaints shall be
conducted by staff members of the City Human
Relations Commission or their agents. Where the
investigating staff member or agent finds facts

finding shall be made and the case then referred to the
Commission for public hearing. However, subsequent
2016 S-13
34 Anderson - Administration
to the setting of the case for public hearing and prior
to the hearing, the Commission staff shall make
reasonable effort to conciliate all issues raised during
the investigation of the case.
(2) When the recommendation after the
investigation is no probable cause, the complainant
shall be furnished with a copy of the findings of fact
and recommendations and shall be given ten days to
make a written request, with the reasons therefor, to
the Commission for review of the finding. On the
receipt of the request for review, the chairman of the
Commission shall appoint a hearing commissioner
who will review complainant’s request and whose
decision will be binding and final on adoption by a
majority of the commissioners present who are
qualified to participate in the final decision.
Whenever such commissioner is named for the
purpose of reviewing a request for reconsideration by
a complainant, the commissioner shall be disqualified
from any further participation in that case, except as
a witness at a public hearing on the complaint.
(3) When a complaint is filed with the
Commission and it has no professional staff, the
chairman shall designate on a rotating basis three
Commissioners during each calendar month, who shall
serve as panel hearing officers on the complaint. Any
commissioners involved in an investigation or attempt
at conciliation of a complaint shall be disqualified
from being a commissioner who hears a complainant’s
request for review on that complaint or participating
in the final decision except as a witness at a public
hearing on the complaint. If the panel commissioners
hearing the complaint shall find no probable cause to
credit the allegations, a written statement of the
findings of fact and decision shall be sent to the
complainant who shall have ten days from receipt
thereof to submit a written request to the Commission
for a review of the decision with the reasons therefor.
(4) When the chairman receives such a
request for review, he shall appoint a commissioner to
review the findings of fact made by the investigating
commissioner and any additional evidence which is
subsequently available. If the reviewing commissioner
shall reach the same decision as the investigating
commissioner, the decision shall be final on adoption
by a majority of the commissioners present who are
qualified to participate in the final decision. If the two
commissioners differ in their conclusions and the
matter is not conciliated, the complaint shall be set for
public hearing before the other members of the
Commission.
(F) To reduce the terms of conciliation agreed to
by the parties to writing to be called a consent
agreement which the parties and a majority of the
commissioners shall sign. When so signed, the
consent agreement shall have the same effect as a
cease and desist order pursuant to division (J) below.
If the Commission determines that a party to the
consent agreement is not complying with it, the
Commission may obtain enforcement of the consent
agreement in a circuit or superior court on showing
that the party is not complying with the consent
agreement, and the party is subject to the
Commission’s jurisdiction, and resides or transacts
business within the county in which the petition for
enforcement is brought.
(G) To hold hearings, to subpoena witnesses,
compel their attendance, administer oaths, take
testimony of any person under oath, and require the

pertaining to any matter under investigation or in
question before the Commission. The Commission
may make rules governing the issuance of subpoenas
by individual commissioners.
(H) To prevent any person from discharging,
expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any
other person because he filed a complaint or testified
in any hearing before this Commission or in any way
assisted the Commission in any matter under its
investigation.
(I) To issue a temporary emergency order
against any person requiring such person to do an act
preserving the possibility of a remedy for a complaint
or to refrain from doing an act damaging the
possibility of a remedy during the investigation of a
complaint; provided:
(1) That no temporary emergency order
shall be issued unless a time and place for hearing on
the temporary emergency order is designated in the
order;
2016 S-13
Boards and Commissions 35
(2) That the hearing on the temporary
emergency order shall be held within ten days
following the issuance of the temporary order, unless
continued by the Commission at the request of the
respondent. The Commission shall thereupon weigh
the comparative hardship to complainant and
respondent and issue a decision continuing or
terminating the temporary emergency order, pending
final disposition of the complaint. The respondent
may waive the hearing without prejudice to his
defense of the matters charged in the complaint, in
which case the temporary order shall remain in effect
pending final disposition of the complaint.
(3) The Commission may by rule provide
for issuance of its temporary order by a single
member of the Commission, and it may compel
compliance with any such temporary order by
bringing a proceeding in any circuit or superior court
for prohibitory or mandatory injunction on showing
that such person is subject to the court’s jurisdiction,
resides or transacts business within the county in
which the proceeding is brought and that such
injunction is necessary to protect the complainant’s
rights under this subchapter until his complaint is
resolved through conciliation or public hearing.
(J) (1) To state its findings of fact after
hearing, which statement shall be made in a written
opinion containing both the findings of fact and the
principles of law applied. All written opinions shall
be compiled and maintained as public record and, in
making decisions, the Commission shall give due
consideration to its prior decisions which may be
applicable. If a majority of the Commissioners who
hear the case find that a person has engaged in an
unlawful discriminatory practice, the Commission
shall cause to be served on the person an order
requiring the person to cease and desist from the
unlawful discriminatory practice and requiring such
person to take further affirmative action necessary to
effectuate the purpose of this subchapter.
(2) If unlawful discrimination is found in
the area of employment, an order shall be issued
requiring the respondent to take such affirmative
action, including, but not limited to, hiring,
reinstatement, and upgrading of employees or people
deprived of employment opportunity to the status to
which the complainant’s would have been entitled had
they not been deprived of equal opportunity, and,
alternatively or in addition thereto, an order may be
issued requiring the respondent to pay to complainant
compensatory damages.
(3) If unlawful discrimination is found in
the area of housing or acquisition of real property, an
order may be issued requiring a respondent to take
affirmative action, including, but not limited to,
renting, selling, or leasing to a person deprived of
equal opportunity, and such other affirmative action as
will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including,
but not limited to, the power to restore complainant’s
losses incurred as a result of the discriminatory
treatment, as the Commission may deem necessary to
assure justice.
(4) If unlawful discrimination is found in
the area of public accommodations, an order shall be
issued requiring respondent to take affirmative action
including, but not limited to, providing service,
goods, or access to property, instatement to
membership, reinstatement to membership, and
posting of notice that the facility is a public
accommodation, with compensatory damages to which
the complainant would be entitled because of the
denial of equal opportunity.
(5) If unlawful discrimination is found in
the area of education, an order may be issued
requiring respondent to take affirmative action
including, but not limited to, a review and revision of
school boundaries, revision of teaching aids and
materials, human relations training for personnel,
recruitment of minority people for professional staff,
with compensatory damages to which the complainant
would be entitled because of denial of equal
opportunity.
(6) If, on all the evidence, the Commission
shall find that a person has not engaged in any such
unlawful practice or violation of this subchapter, the
Commission shall state its findings of fact and shall
issue and cause to be served on the complainant an
order dismissing the complaint as to such person.
2016 S-13
36 Anderson - Administration
(7) Affirmative Action within the meaning
of this chapter includes the power to assess punitive
damages within the discretion of the Commission.
Any award of punitive damages may not exceed the
sum of $1,000 and any award shall only be upon a
two-thirds majority of the Commission sitting at public
hearings. In addressing the issue of punitive damages,
the Commission shall consider the following factors:
the oppressiveness or egregiousness of respondent’s
conduct; whether or not the respondent has been
found by a court, commission or other adjudicative
body having the power to enforce civil right
ordinances or statutes, to have violated civil rights
laws, within the preceding three calendar years;
whether the respondent’s violation consisted of a
single act, an on-going act, or a series of acts; and the
extent to which such award is necessary to effectuate
the purposes of this chapter.
(8) A member of the City Legal
Department shall be in attendance and assist the
Commission at any hearings, including but not limited
to, conciliation conferences, pre-hearing conferences,
and public hearings.
(K) Judicial review of such cease and desist
order, or other final order, or other affirmative action
or damages as referred to in this subchapter may be

received by the Board are substantially related to the
operative facts that form the basis of any pending
action before an administrative body, court, or of a
notice of tort claim or other threatened litigation, the
Board shall not take any further action on the
complaint.
(7) Conflict of interest. Each member of the
Board shall disclose any possible conflict of interest
created by personal experiences, or relationships with
the complainant or persons mentioned in complaints,
and shall not hear any matter in which they or any
person who is a spouse, son, daughter, or other lineal
descendant, parent, sibling or son or daughter of a
sibling, or cousin within the second degree of
relationship, have a personal or financial interest.

information presented to the entire Board.
Accordingly, members shall refrain from having
private communications with complainants or
witnesses. If a member is approached by any person
regarding a matter being investigated by the Board,

respect to a particular matter being investigated, that
member shall not participate in any way.

elapsed from the time the complaint was first made to
the head of the city department concerned.

TRANSFERS
§ 35.045 POLICY.
Transfers are defined as the assignment of an
employee from one position in the city to another
position of the same, greater or lesser classification.
Transfers fall into two categories: voluntary or
involuntary. The procedures outlined below describe
the specific requirements for each category of
transfer.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89)
§ 35.046 VOLUNTARY TRANSFER.
(A) A transfer is the assignment of an employee
from one position to another position of the same or
greater or lesser pay classification. All transfers shall
be made in the interest of service, focusing on the
city’s primary concern of meeting its statutory
requirements and public service commitments. To the
best of its ability the city will try to accommodate the
desires and best interest of its employees while
fulfilling its obligations. Possibilities for a transfer will
be based on qualifications of the employee for
acceptable performance in the new job.
(B) Factors such as education, training,
experience, past job performance and potential for
future performance in the new position shall be the
basis for consideration. Employees must notify the
Personnel Department of their desire to make a
transfer. All interviews must be arranged through the
Personnel Department. An employee must be in a
position a minimum of 180 working days and off of
the trial period before initiating a transfer of any kind.
The transfer must be approved by the appropriate
department heads and Personnel Administrator.
(C) Employees wishing to be considered for a
transfer must notify the Personnel Department of their
desire. Transfers will only be considered when a job
opening exists or when departments can exchange
employees. The transfer request should provide all
relevant personal information to allow the city an
opportunity to review employee’s qualifications.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89; Am. Res. 43-92, passed
9-10-92)
§ 35.047 INVOLUNTARY TRANSFER.
These may be initiated at any time. If the
department head and Director of Personnel thinks the
transfer is made in the interest of service, focusing on
the city’s primary concern of meeting its statutory
requirement, public service and betterment of the
department, then it can occur. If the employee objects
to the involuntary transfer he has a right to the
complaint procedure (See § 35.190). Once a transfer
is agreed upon and the involved parties are notified of
the change by the Personnel Department, there may be
a two-week waiting period to allow all involved
parties to make sufficient adjustments. Every effort
will be made to transfer employees into an equal
classification and pay scale but the position can be of
lower or higher classification and pay.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89; Am. Res. 43-92, passed
9-10-92)
§ 35.048 GENERAL GUIDELINES.
Once the decision to transfer is made the
Personnel Department will notify all concerned
parties. Transfers are not to be considered as new
hires with respect to the accumulation of benefits. City
seniority will be continuous although the employee
will be subject to departmental requirements.
Employees will receive a salary commensurate with
the position classification, and their experience and
seniority. Transferred employees will serve a trial
period ranging from 90 days to a maximum of six
months. There is no guarantee of employment if
performance is below the minimum level.

SALARY GRADES/PAY RANGES
§ 35.060 HIRING RATES AND USE OF SALARY
GRADES.
For hiring purposes the salary grades have been
divided into pay ranges. The following procedures
apply.
(A) Those employees being hired or transferred
into a position who have relatively little or no
background experience should be hired in at the
minimum of the range of the grade. Transferred
employees that have similar experience in a field
should carry their seniority with them to the new
position.
(B) New employees being hired into a position
who have prior experience may be hired as experience
and ability dictate but in no case above the three year
range of that grade.
(C) Once assigned to a rate the employee must
earn their seniority before moving to the next range.
(D) No salary increase may be given to an
employee that shall cause that employee’s salary to be
over the maximum of that position’s salary grade.
(E) Anytime a condition exists with respect to
the city’s fiscal position or under other circumstances
which would cause the granting of pay increases to be
unwarranted, the Mayor, at his discretion, may
suspend all pay increases for such time as may be
deemed necessary.
(F) Pay increases provided under the job
classification schedules are not to be considered
automatic. These increases are based upon the
performance and seniority of the individual employee
and must be initiated by the respective department
head and approved by the appropriate board.

the necessary skills and abilities needed to continue
services.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89)

this procedure if needed to ensure the efficiency of the
department.

(A) Policy. Employees may be granted an
unpaid personal leave of absence provided a written
application is submitted for approval when they have
completed their trial period. No personal leaves will
be granted until the employee first exhausts all
available vacation and personal time. No personal
leave of absence may exceed six months in duration.
(B) Application procedures. An employee
desiring a personal leave of absence must prepare a
fully detailed written request stating the purpose of the
leave, and the starting and ending dates of the leave.
68 Anderson - Administration
The request should be submitted to the Department
Head or the appropriate board, who, with the
Personnel Administrator, will review the request and
approve or deny it. A written decision shall be
provided to the employee. The request for a personal
leave must be made at least two weeks prior to the
first day of the leave.
(C) Considerations. Management’s consideration
of any request for a leave shall be affected by the
following conditions:
(1) The employee’s record of performance.
(2) The urgency of the employee’s
situation.
(3) The workload of the department.
(D) Conditions. An employee on a personal
leave of absence is subject to the following conditions:

share only. For leaves exceeding 30 days, the
employee is responsible to pay the total benefit cost.
(5) The employee returning from a personal
leave of absence must realize there are no automatic
job rights. Their return is contingent upon availability
of current openings for which they are qualified.
Every effort shall be made to return the employee to
their former position.
(6) If the employee has an unexcused
absence and fails to return to work on the first
working day following the expiration of the leave they
shall be considered to have voluntarily resigned.

time rests with the department head and is based on
preserving the efficiency of services.

(C) Holidays occurring during vacations. If a
holiday or holidays occur during the period of time an
employee is on an authorized vacation, the holiday
shall not be counted as a vacation day.
(D) Carry-over of vacation time. If specific work
requirements imposed on the employee by the city
make it impossible for the employee to take the full
amount of vacation time due, the department head
may authorize the available vacation time remaining to
be carried-over until the next calendar year. Any
vacation time that has been approved for carry-over
must be used before March 31 of the following year

§ 35.113 SICK TIME.
(A) General. Sick leave time is a protection
provided to employees in cases of personal illness or
illness in immediate family. Employees should
consider their sick leave benefits as an insurance
policy, only to be used as needed, and under specified
conditions.
(B) Accrual. Full-time employees shall accrue
sick leave days at the rate of 1.25 days per month.
Part-time employees and temporary employees accrue
no sick leave days. Newly hired employees shall
begin accumulating sick leave time commencing with
the month following their first full month of
employment. The 1.25 days per month will not
accrue if an employee is on unpaid sick leave and has
not worked a minimum of 15 calendar days of that
month.
(C) Accumulation. Earned sick leave time may
be accumulated, and carried from year to year. An
employee may accumulate up to, but not exceeding,
180 days. Only sick leave time earned since January
1, 1979 may be accumulated unless the employee had
worked for a department where a statement of policy
was followed. Newly hired employees shall begin
accumulating sick leave time commencing with the
month following their first full month of employment.
(D) Conversion. An employee whose sick leave
time exceeds the maximum accumulation may convert
the excess sick time to vacation time at the rate of two
sick days for one vacation day. An employee wishing
to convert sick time should file a written request with
their department head. Upon approval, the employee
shall be credited with the additional vacation time, and
the sick time reduced accordingly.
(E) Conditions for payment of sick time.
Employees requesting sick time pay must meet the
following conditions:
(1) The employee must have sick time
credits from which to draw. In no case shall sick leave
time be advanced to an employee before it is earned.
(2) Employees must notify their supervisor
of their absence by the beginning of their regular
starting time. Failure to notify may result in the
absence being considered unauthorized and without
pay. Employees absent from work without previous
arrangement, or notification, for three consecutive
days will be a voluntary resignation.
(3) The city reserves the right to verify
illnesses and injuries through its own city doctors, or
by requiring the employee to provide a written
doctor’s statement from their personal physician.
(4) The city reserves the right to deny sick
leave pay if the employee is injured while working for
another employer or through self-employment.
70 Anderson - Administration
(5) In cases of malingering, sick leave time
may be designated as vacation, personal time, or leave
without pay.
(6) Abuse of the sick leave policy shall
result in appropriate disciplinary action.
(7) A maximum of three sick days per year
may be used for illnesses within the immediate family.
(8) If a holiday occurs during the period of
time an employee is on paid sick leave, the employee
shall receive holiday pay and the holiday shall not be
counted as a sick day if the employee has sick time
credits from which to draw.
(F) Sick accumulation at termination. An
employee that has ten years of continuous
uninterrupted service with the city will be eligible for
one-half of their accumulated sick days if they retire,
leave the city on a medical disability, or become
deceased. Sick leave pay shall be calculated on the
employee’s current rate of pay.
(G) Extended sick leave. Absence from work due
to illness or accident for 60 days or more shall be
considered an extended sick leave and subject to the
following conditions:
(1) It is the employee’s responsibility to
keep their supervisor informed of their status. At a
minimum this means providing a doctor’s statement
which gives the nature of the problem and the
expected date of return to work.
(2) An employee requiring a longer
convalescence period must submit a written request to
the department head or appropriate board for an
extension. Such written request must be accompanied
by a written report from the employee’s physician
stating the nature of the employee’s illness or injury
and the anticipated period of convalescence. Such
extension shall be granted unless the employer finds
that the extension imposes an undue hardship or
burden on the employer. Extensions are not automatic
and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
(3) An employee returning from an
extended sick leave must provide a physician’s
statement releasing them to return to work. The
employee shall report to the Personnel Office in order
to be released for work.
(4) Violation of the terms of an extended
sick leave may result in immediate termination.
(H) Unpaid sick days.
(1) Before an employee is placed on unpaid
sick leave all accrued sick hours, vacation hours,
personal days and attendance award days must be first
exhausted.
(2) An employee who is placed on unpaid
sick leave will not accrue monthly sick hour benefits.
No employee will be paid for holidays when on an
unpaid sick leave status.
(I) Attendance award days. If an employee has
accumulated and maintained 60 days sick leave credit
by January 1 of any given year, the employee has the
option to take two attendance award days during the
calendar year. Attendance award days cannot be
carried over to the next calendar year nor be paid out
upon retirement or termination. The days must be
approved by the department head for scheduling.
(J) Family and Medical Leave Act Policy
(FMLA). The city recognizes and implements the
Family and Medical Leave Act. The city’s sick leave
policy will be in effect for city employees for medical
purposes. FMLA will be incorporated into the sick
leave policy when a serious medical condition arises
for an employee. The Act requires that employers
provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave upon the
occurrence of certain family member’s or employee’s
medical situations. The city will determine a serious
medical condition in accordance with FMLA and
ADA guidelines. Reasons for family and medical
leaves are as follows:
(1) Because of the birth of a child
placement for adoption or foster care of a child.
(2) In order to care for the spouse, son,
daughter or parents of the employee, if such spouse,
son, daughter, or parent has a serious health
condition. This does not apply to in-laws.
Personnel Policies and Procedures 71
(3) Because of a serious health condition
that makes the employee unable to perform his or her
employment functions.
(4) An employee eligible for the provisions
of the FMLA must have been employed by the city at
least 12 months and have physically worked 1,250
hours of service during the 12-month period
immediately preceding the commencement of leave.
(5) Criteria obligations for leave.
(a) Twelve-month period measured
forward from the employee’s first FMLA leave
request.
(b) Twelve weeks of leave are only
granted every 12 months.
(c) The 12-month period required for
future leaves is established at the time the employee
utilizes his or her first FMLA leave.
(d) The employee must provide the
department head and the Personnel Director 30 days’
advance notice of the leave or such notice as is
practicable if 30 days’ notice is not possible.
(e) The employee must provide the
department head and the Personnel Director with
certification of the condition from a health care
provider. The appropriate certification form must be
filled out.
(f) A husband and wife who are
eligible for FMLA leave and are both employed by the
city will be permitted to take only a combined total of
12 weeks leave for a family illness. However, each
spouse could later use the additional weeks due to
another family illness that is not related to the first
incident.
(g) While on FMLA leave the
employee is responsible for their contribution of health
insurance premiums. If the employee fails to return
after the FMLA, the city’s portion of the health care
cost must be met by the employee.
(h) The employee must first exhaust all
accrued sick, vacation, personal and attendance award
days before going on unpaid leave for any type of
FMLA leave. Any such accrued sick, vacation,
personal or attendance award days so taken shall be
included as time taken for purposes of determining the
maximum 12-week leave allowed under FMLA.
(i) The employee must provide the
department head and Personnel Director with the
Certification of Physician or Practitioner form in order
to be eligible for leave. Forms are available in the
Personnel Department. An employee who is applying
for medical leave under the FMLA leave may be
required by the city to submit second or third medical
opinions at the city’s expense, and a fitness for duty
report to return back to work.
(j) The city will require every three
weeks a physician’s status report while the employee
is on FMLA leave.
(6) Intermittent leave. Intermittent leave or
“reduced leave scheduling” may be used in some
circumstances and will be determined by the Personnel
Director and department head. Intermittent leave will
not be used in connection with a birth or adoption.
(7) Reinstatement from FMLA leave. An
employee returning from FMLA leave will be restored
to the same position, or an equivalent position with
equivalent pay, benefits and conditions. An employee
who loses a necessary job certification, license, or
credentials while on leave will be given a reasonable
time in which to requalify. All records pertaining to
an employee’s FMLA leave will be maintained in the
Personnel Department.
(K) Time bank.
(1) All non-bargaining unit employees may
be eligible for donated time benefits, subject to the
terms of this section, to relieve hardship resulting
from extended illness or Family and Medical Leave.
When it is brought to the attention of the Mayor and
the Personnel Director that an employee’s paid leave
time has been or is about to be exhausted, and they
2009 S-6
72 Anderson - Administration
are made aware of a serious personal or family illness
matter of the employee, the Mayor and Personnel
Director in investigating the matter may consider the
following:
(a) The character of the employee’s or
family member’s ailment;
(b) The health care provider’s
prognosis;
(c) The employee’s history of paid
leave usage; and
(d) Any other details of the
investigation and any recommendation he may have
concerning the employee’s eligibility as a recipient of
donated time.
(2) The approval of donated time for a
recipient shall be the decision of the Mayor and at his
sole discretion. This resolution shall not be construed
to create any rights nor obligations but is solely at the
discretion of the city.
(3) Employees shall donate a minimum of
one hour sick leave or vacation per year to the
donated time bank. An employee may voluntarily
donate vacation leave or a maximum of one-half or his
or her sick leave balance per year. Time donated
must be in one-hour increments.
(4) Donated time shall be converted to its
cash equivalence and paid to the recipient at his or her
regular hourly rate.
(5) Donated time shall be drawn from the
donated time bank in as equitable fashion as is
feasible.
(6) In no case will donated time be used to
extend an employee’s period of active duty beyond a
recommended retirement date established by the city
appointed physician.
(7) Once an employee donates time to the
time bank it will not be returned to his or her accrual
but will remain in the donated time bank.
(8) Employees receiving donated time may
include members of collective bargaining units of the
city.

Accordingly, there is hereby declared to be the
following anti-sexual harassment policy and
procedure: No official, elected or appointed,

EMPLOYEE CHARGED WITH
CRIMINAL OFFENSE
§ 35.180 PROCEDURE.
This is the procedure for dealing with employees
who have been charged with criminal offenses. It is
understood that an employee is innocent until proven
guilty and as such is entitled to certain constitutional
safeguards. On the other hand, employees of public
government are in positions of public trust and thus
are subject to the highest degree of scrutiny.
(A) (1) The decision to take disciplinary action
is a matter of discretion to be vested in:
(a) Personnel Director.
(b) Department head and/or
appropriate board.
(c) City Attorney.
(2) The decision must be made within ten
working days upon receiving or learning of the
charges.
(B) The rationale for the maximum of ten
working days is to allow management time to examine
the facts and circumstances of the particular offense
and how it will affect government’s responsibility for
the public trust.
(C) Once a determination of the disciplinary
action has been made a decision in writing shall be
provided to the employee within the ten-day period.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89; Am. Res. 43-92, passed
9-10-92)
PERSONNEL COMPLAINTS
§ 35.190 PROCEDURE.
(A) It is incumbent upon the city to provide a
process by which an employee may seek assistance
with a work related complaint. A written statement
must be prepared explaining what happened. The
following is the proper complaint procedure.
(1) Discuss written complaint with the
immediate supervisor.
(2) Discuss written complaint with the
department head.
(3) Discuss written complaint with the
Personnel Director.
(4) Discuss written complaint with the
appropriate board.
(B) Recommendations will be made by the
Personnel Department to resolve the problem within
a reasonable period of time. A final decision will be

employee in writing within five working days of that
decision.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89; Am. Res. 43-92, passed
9-10-92)
DISCIPLINARY POLICIES
§ 35.200 DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES.
(A) In public agencies it is imperative for
employees who serve the public to follow rules and
regulations on work performance and personal
conduct, to work well with their fellow employees and
to do all the things that contribute to good
performance and reaching agency goals. So long as
employee behavior is positive and supportive of
organizational goals, all is well. But when employee
behavior departs for the norm or the standard set by
the city, the need for disciplinary action arises.
Corrective discipline, referred to as progressive
discipline, is based on the belief that discipline should
serve to correct unsatisfactory behavior. It shows the
employee that he has violated the accepted work
policy of the city. This is especially important as
positive discipline because it will, in most cases, allow
the employee to correct his behavior. The basic steps
Personnel Policies and Procedures 81
that reflect this principle are written reprimand,
suspension without pay, demotion, and termination.
However, there are exceptions to these basic steps and
they demand on the nature or severity of the
infractions. There are three basic types of infractions:
Group I, Group II, and Group III.
(1) Group I. Infractions are offenses of the
least severe type. The progressive steps that follow
this type of infraction are: Reprimands, suspension
without pay and demotion or termination.
(2) Group II. An infraction that warrants
more than a reprimand will result in suspension
without pay as the first disciplinary step.
(3) Group III. The most severe type of
infractions. Such offenses because of the severity,
could result in indefinite suspension or termination or
demotion as determined by the department head and
Personnel Director.
(B) All disciplinary actions must be in writing.
The original must be submitted to the Personnel
Department with copies going to the supervisor and
the employee. A suspension, demotion, or
termination cannot occur without the record of
disciplinary action submitted to the Personnel
Department.
(C) If in § 35.201 an action is not listed,
consultation between the department head and
Personnel Director will determine the group placement
for the infraction.
(Res. 14-89, passed 3-9-89; Am. Res. 43-92, passed
9-10-92)

MILITARY DUTY
§ 35.300 HEALTH INSURANCE FOR
EMPLOYEES CALLED TO ACTIVE
MILITARY DUTY.
(A) If a city employee is called to active military
duty, the city shall take necessary steps to ensure that
the employee’s city health insurance benefits are
coordinated with the employee’s military health
coverage benefits, so that there is no gap in time
where the employee or a covered dependent is not
covered by one of the two insurance programs. It shall
be the responsibility of the city’s insurance
representative to remain in contact with the employee,
the employee’s family member, or military to
2008 S-5
Personnel Policies and Procedures 86A
ascertain when the military coverage becomes
effective. It is the employee’s responsibility to
cooperate in providing any information or
documentation necessary. The city will not suspend
the employee’s coverage until the military coverage
becomes effective. When the city is notified that the
employee will return to city employment, the city will
reinstate the employee’s coverage to coincide with
either the employee’s return to work, or when the
military coverage lapses, whichever occurs first.
(B) When an employee begins active military
service and the employee’s city health coverage is
suspended, the Director of Human Resources will
cause a written notification to issue to the City
Attorney, the Mayor and the President of the City
Council. Likewise, when an employee returns from
active military service to city employment and his or
her city coverage again becomes effective, the same
type of notification shall issue.
(C) As a token of appreciation for the sacrifices
made by active duty military personnel, the city shall
provide a welcome-home benefit to such employees
upon their return to city employment. The
welcome-home benefit shall consist of an abatement of
the employee’s portion of the employee’s health
insurance premium payment. One month’s worth of
any such payment shall be abated for each month or
partial month that the employee served in active duty
military service immediately preceding his return to
city employment. Any payment required to be made
on the employee’s behalf shall be paid by the city
from funds budgeted for insurance.
(D) Upon return from active military duty, an
employee shall be presented a Certificate of
Appreciation by the Mayor, which certificate shall
also set forth the length of the employee’s
welcome-home benefit.

(Ord. 40-06, passed 5-11-06)
EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PROGRAM
§ 35.315 ESTABLISHMENT OF EMPLOYEE
INCENTIVE PROGRAM.
(A) Eligibility for the employee incentive
program is limited to full- or part-time city employees.
(B) Eligible employees may be paid an incentive
payment for submitting suggestions that save the city
money. To be eligible for payment, an employee must
submit a written suggestion to that employee’s
immediate supervisor or department head that actually
results in a measurable savings of public money by the
city, or a measurable increase in revenue directly
attributable to the suggestion.
(C) Incentive payments will be based on a
percentage of the actual savings or increased revenue
to the city by implementing the employee’s suggestion
over the course of one year. Incentive payments may
be made up to 20% of actual net savings or increased
revenue to the city, up to a maximum of $10,000 per
employee per year. Incentive payments shall be
considered earned income. If multiple employees
jointly submit the same suggestion, they will split an
incentive payment. If multiple employees submit the
same suggestion separately, an incentive payment
would be made to the first employee to submit the
suggestion.
(D) Incentive payments shall come from the
same departmental budget or other funding source
where the money was saved, or from the budget of the
department taking action to increase revenue. The
City Council must still approve any necessary
transfers between major budget classifications or
appropriations necessary to fund an incentive
payment.
(E) There is established an employee incentive
committee, comprised of one representative each from
the Mayor’s office, the Board of Public Works, the
Board of Public Safety, the City Council, the City
Labor Union Coalition, the Controller’s office and
the Human Resources Department. This committee
shall review employee suggestions and determine
whether they are entitled to an award under this
program, subject to final approval by either the Board
of Public Works or Board of Public Safety. The
decision of either board is final. The committee may
implement additional rules or policies governing the
employee incentive program.
(F) The employee incentive program is a
management tool, designed to allow the city to
encourage creativity and efficiency in its work force.
The Board of Public Works and the Board of Public
Safety reserve the right to determine when incentive
payments shall be made. The creation of this program
does not grant any property, contractual or other right
to employees. The city reserves the right to suspend
or end this program at any time, or decline to pay a
financial incentive because of financial limitations,
uncertainty of financial savings to the city, or any
other reason.
(G) The employee incentive committee may also
receive suggestions from employees for ideas to
improve the safety of city operations, for employees
or the public. These suggestions will be evaluated by
the employee incentive committee, which may award
up to $50 per suggestion, subject to approval from the
Board of Public Works or the Board of Public Safety.

bid requirements.
(5) The Human Relations Department shall
conduct an annual review of how well the offices,

goals in soliciting prices from local MBEs and WBEs.
Such review shall be based on the actual solicitation of

a bidder be required to award a subcontract to a local
MBE/WBE, but it may not unlawfully discriminate
against said MBE/WBE.

report to the city offices, departments and boards
concerning contract language and procedures which
will enable MBEs and WBEs to more competitively
submit bids to the city or to prime contractors

determination as to whether non-compliance or a

determination. A determination of such discriminatory
practice following notice and hearing before the Board
shall be referred to the appropriate state and federal
enforcement agencies for appropriate action. A
finding of such a discriminatory practice shall prohibit
that firm from being awarded a contract or being a
subcontractor on a city contract for a period of one
year from the date of such determination.
Additionally, such a determination may be grounds for
terminating the contract to which the discriminatory
practice or non-compliance pertains.

rules and regulations to implement this subchapter and
carry out its duties hereunder, consistent with this
subchapter. These rules and regulations shall be

or bids are to be received, attached to the
specifications shall be a list of MBEs and WBEs in
order to make the prime contractors, i.e. bidders,

work to be performed by each WBE or MBE and the
dollar value of the work to be performed by the WBEs
and MBEs. If the contractor does not meet or exceed

shall provide an explanation as to why the goals were
not met. A satisfactory explanation shall include but
not be limited to the following:

(E) The Human Relations Department shall
determine whether the prime contractor has submitted
a satisfactory explanation for not meeting the goal
established. A determination of not providing a
satisfactory explanation may be appealed to the
Utilization Board. No contract for which a goal has
been established may be awarded to a contractor who
has not met that goal or has not provided a satisfactory
explanation for not meeting that goal. No contractor
shall be penalized for utilizing non-local MBEs or
WBEs.

§ 39.08 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
ACT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
(A) Step one: file the grievance.
(1) Complete the City of Anderson’s
grievance form. Grievance form can be found on the
City of Ander son, Indiana’ s website
(www.cityofanderson.com) or in the ADA
Coordinator’s office. A grievance may be
communicated in writing, by e-mail, by fax or by
telephone, but must follow the format of the City of
Anderson’s grievance form.
(2) A grievance concerning the accessibility
of the city’s services, programs or activities should be
addressed to:
Frank E. Owens, ADA Coordinator
120 East 8th Street
Anderson, IN 46018
(765) 648-6057
(B) Step two: acknowledgment. A grievance
should be filed within 90 days after the grievant party
becomes aware of the alleged violation. The ADA
Coordinator will send an acknowledgment of receipt
of the grievance within 12 working days.
(C) Step three: informal resolution. Following
the filing of a grievance, the ADA Coordinator shall
determine whether, and to what extent, an
investigation of the grievance is warranted. Any
resulting investigation shall be conducted by the ADA
Coordinator or his/her designee. In the case of a
property or access issue, the grievance will also be
investigated by the city’s Property Manager. A
thorough investigation affords all interested persons
and their representatives an opportunity to submit
evidence relevant to a grievance. The ADA
Coordinator will complete the investigation within 60
calendar days of receipt of the grievance. If
appropriate, the ADA Coordinator will arrange to
meet with the grievant to discuss the matter and
attempt to reach an informal resolution of the
grievance. Any informal resolution of the grievance
shall be documented in the ADA Coordinator file and
the case will be closed.
(D) Step four: written determination. If an
informal resolution of the grievance is not reached in
Step 3, within 60 calendar days of receipt of the
grievance, a written determination as to the validity of
the complaint, and description of the resolution, if
appropriate, shall be forwarded by the ADA
Coordinator to the Executive Officer for approval.
(E) Step five: final determination and resolution.
(1) The ADA Coordinator shall
communicate the determination and resolution to the
grievant within 90 calendar days of receipt of the
grievance, unless the Executive Officer authorizes
additional time for further consideration of the
grievance. Any authorized extension of time will be
communicated to the grievant. Any request for
reconsideration of the response to the grievance shall
be at the discretion of the Executive Officer.
2017 S-14 Repl.
112 Anderson - Administration
(2) If the grievant is not satisfied with the
city’s handling of the grievance at any stage of the
process, or does not wish to file a grievance through
the city’s ADA Title II Grievance Procedures, the
grievant may file a complaint directly with the U. S.
Department of Justice or other appropriate state or
federal agency. Use of the city’s grievance procedure
is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
(3) The resolution of any specific grievance
will require consideration of varying circumstances,
such as the specific nature of the disability; the nature
of the access to services, programs, or facilities at
issue; the essential eligibility requirements for
participation; the health and safety of others; and the
degree to which an accommodation would constitute
a fundamental alteration to the service, program or
facility, or cause an undue hardship to the city.
Accordingly, the resolution by the city of any one
grievance does not constitute a precedent upon which
the city is bound or upon which other complaining
parties may rely.
(F) File maintenance. The city’s ADA
Coordinator shall maintain ADA Grievance files for
three years.

(D) Final bills will be due and payable at the
time of discontinuance of service or due date on bill.
When utility is unable to obtain the reading of a meter
after reasonable effort, it may estimate the reading and
render a bill, so marked. In the event that the meter
has been estimated four consecutive months, utility
has the right to disconnect until egress has been made.
In the event utility’s meter fails to register properly
for any reason, utility shall estimate customer’s water
use and/or other bill determinants during the period of
failure based on such factors as customer’s historical
usage during a like corresponding period.

rendered for payment of a customer’s bill due to
non-sufficient funds, a handling charge may be
charged to customer. The handling charge will be the

for the total bill amount under $500. The total bill
amount is defined as all utility services. A 10% down
payment is required with the balance due in ten
working days. Customers failing to meet the
obligation of the agreement will have their service
disconnected without further notice and will not be

DISCONTINUE SERVICE.
(A) Customer’s who have not contracted for
service for a specified term may have service
discontinued by giving notice at utility’s office of the
date on which customer desires that service be
discontinued. Utility will endeavor to obtain the final
meter reading on the date customer specifies in his
notice, but shall not be obligated to do so unless
customer’s notice provides utility at least three
working days with access to the meter. Customer
shall be obligated to pay for service rendered to
customer until the final meter reading is obtained by
utility. A customer who has contracted for service for
a specified time may have service discontinued by
giving notice at utility’s office and agreeing to pay for
service used to the date of disconnection. Customer
shall also be liable for the minimum charges, if such
charge exists, which would be due utility for the
remaining period of the agreement in accordance with
the agreement provisions.
(B) A customer requesting that the water
department shut off service to a property is done to
relieve the customer of the obligation to pay for water
service. A shutoff does not guarantee that no water
damage will occur. A mechanical failure, vandalism,
or other causes may result in water still being supplied
to your property after a shutoff. The owner or
occupant must take measures to prevent water
damage, even after a shutoff. Such measures may
include:
(1) Closing valves in the main supply line
to the house;
(2) Draining pipes, toilet tanks, water
heaters, water softeners, or other stored water in the
system;
(3) Adding appropriate levels of antifreeze
to any water that will remain in the system during cold
weather (such as in drain traps);
(4) Maintaining a least minimal heat during
cold weather;
(5) Periodically checking for leaks or
damage.
(C) If water damage occurs after a shutoff, it
will be the responsibility of the owner or occupant to
repair that damage. The utility is not responsible for
any damage resulting from turning off or failing to
turn off water service to a property.
(D) The customer will be required to sign a
written acknowledgment and agree to hold the utility
harmless from any damages.
(Ord. 50-06, passed 7-13-06)

reasons:
(1) When, in the utility’s opinion, a
condition exists that is dangerous or hazardous to life,
physical safety or property;
(2) When emergency repairs must be made
to utility’s facilities or system;

service supplied by utility to other customers; or
(5) When customer fails to comply with the
provisions of either the tariffs, the applicable rate
schedule, the general terms and conditions for water
service, or the agreement for service.
(C) Discontinuance of service in accordance with
the provisions stated above shall not constitute a
breach of any obligation of utility under any
agreement for service with customer, and utility shall
not in any case be liable to customer for any damages
resulting from such discontinuance of service.
(Ord. 50-06, passed 7-13-06)

and type, designated by local codes, must be installed
in the private service line for the protection of the
customer. Install this valve where the pipe enters the

should be made at the utility office. Determination of
accessibility and all costs, including assessments and
tap fees, shall be made depending upon location and
size of service requested. All fees shall be satisfied

installation of service from the water main to and
including the curb stop. Installation of the service
from the valve to the building is the sole responsibility
of the property owner. The property owner shall
assure all necessary permit and/or inspection
requirements are satisfied through the City of
Anderson Building Commissioners Office. Final
inspection and approval from the building department
is required prior to the installation of a water meter by
the utility. The water utility may at utility’s sole
discretion, under certain circumstances, execute
special agreements for supplying water to properties
not adjacent to a utility water main.
(B) The utility reserves the right to determine the
placement of each service connection so the curb stop
shall, as a general rule, be located between the present

location that shall, in the judgment of the utility,
provide a safer, more convenient or more satisfactory
location for the curb stop and curb box.
(C) The utility shall furnish the labor, equipment
and materials for and install or cause to be installed,
the service connection, which includes the tap in the
main, the curb stop and box and that portion of the
service pipe between them. The customer shall pay the
utility for the cost of such service connections installed
or caused to be installed by the utility. For regular 3/4
inch services totally installed by the utility, a standard
price shall be charged. For services larger than
three-quarter inch, the actual cost of the service
connection shall be charged.
(D) The customer, at his or her own expense,
shall install or cause to be installed the service pipe
beyond the curb stop and into his or her own
premises. The utility and Anderson Building
Commissioners Office reserve the right to inspect each
service run made by a plumber, a contractor or an
individual customer for proper materials and depth of
service before the service trench is backfilled. The
utility and the Anderson Building Commissioners
Office must be informed the work is completed so an
inspection may be performed prior to backfilling. If
notice is not provided, the property owner may be
required to uncover the work so the inspection may be
performed. However, the quality of materials and
workmanship going into such service run shall be the
customer’s responsibility.
(E) Private service lines three inches and larger
in diameter shall be disinfected in accordance with
ANSI/AWWA C651-9, or latest revisions, at the
customer’s expense, before the water supply to such
service pipes is turned on for usage. The customer or
the contractor shall perform the disinfection of such
service pipes. At least three samples obtained from the
service pipes on consecutive days must prove the
water to be satisfactory for usage, which shall be
reported in writing to the Water Engineering
Department of the utility by a laboratory qualified to
make such analysis and acceptable to the utility. The
water utility reserves the right to require such
disinfection on any size private service line where
ever it deems it necessary to protect the integrity of
the public water supply system.
(F) As a general rule, water service shall be
furnished through a single service pipe to only one
property or address. Where a single property consists
of several units or buildings, and is served by a single
service pipe, the property owner has the option of
valving and metering each unit or building separately,
in which case a separate curb stop must be provided,
2007 S-4
Water 12A
outside the building and accessible to the utility, for
each metered unit or building. If the situation is
exceptional, requiring special consideration, the utility
may make such arrangements as the circumstances
require. The utility may require the customer/property
owner to pay for the installation of individual curb
meter tiles and extend individual private service lines
into the building.
(G) All private service lines three inches and
larger in diameter, are recommended to be constructed
of ductile iron pipe and a class in pressure rating
designated by the codes imposed by the Building
Commissioners Office. Any substitution of materials
will conform to local codes and standards. No service
pipe shall be less than 3/4 of an inch nominal
diameter, and all service pipes shall be installed with
minimum of four feet of cover.
(H) Private meter pits and meter vaults shall
conform to the standards and specifications set forth
by the water utility. Location of such meter pits and
vaults shall be approved by the water utility before
construction commences. Final approval for
conformance to specifications will occur before a
meter will be installed and water service is provided.
(I) A private service line between the
distribution main and a building shall be run in a
direct line, whenever it is practicable and possible,
without bends and at a depth of not less than four feet.
No pipe having joints shall be driven. Service pipes
shall not be laid in the same trench with sewers or any
other conduit unless approval has been given, in
writing, by the water utility and Building
Commissioners Office.

(B) These rates generally are based upon
consumption expressed in “units” and measured by
cubic feet; a “unit” being 100 cubic feet off water
which equals 748.5 gallons.
(C) Each customer (user) shall pay a monthly
service charge, in addition to usage charges calculated
under the metered rate schedule most recently
approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission.

§ 50.035 BASIS FOR MONTHLY BILLING.
(A) All charges for water usage, other than for
unmetered fire service or other special purposes, shall
be calculated upon the registration of the meter(s)
installed, which registration shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount of water used.
(B) The utility shall make an effort to read the
remote reading device or meter every month or at
such intervals as may be designated by the utility. In
the months the utility does not read the remote reading
device or meter, or if the utility is unable to gain
access to the customer’s premises, the customer shall
be billed on an estimated basis.
(C) The utility may require that a remote reading
device be installed where access to the meter is denied
or for such other reason as determined by the utility.
(D) Where water is taken through more than one
meter, and where such arrangements is for the
convenience of the customer, then each meter shall be
read and billed separately. Where water is taken
through more than one meter for the convenience of
the utility, then the meter readings shall be aggregated
and billed as one reading.
(E) All water passing through meters shall be
charged for, whether used, wasted, or lost through
leakage.

(G) To qualify to enter into a payment
agreement, the customer must not have entered into
and breached a similar agreement with the utility
during the prior 12-month period.
(H) Disputing the accuracy of a bill shall not be
a valid reason for non-payment or partial payment of
a bill by the customer, and shall not stay the accrual of
finance charges on the delinquency. The customer
may pay a bill under protest, thus giving written
notice that redress is being sought. Such written
notices must be filed with the supervisor of the
customer service department of the utility prior to the
due date of the bill.

§ 50.055 METERING.
(A) Unless otherwise specified in the contract
between the utility and the customer, or by the tariff
on file, all water supplied shall be measured by a
meter or meters of standard manufacture, furnished
and installed by the utility according to the
requirements of the utility in force and effect at that
time. The customer shall provide, free of expense to
the utility, a suitable place near the service entrance
either in the basement, in an approved meter box, or
in another location which is approved by the utility,
for installation of the meter.
(B) The utility shall designate the size and type
of meter to be used for serving each customer. Each
building to be served directly from the main must be
supplied by at least a 3/4-inch service. When the
service is larger than this, the utility reserves the right
to designate the number of meters that can be supplied
by such service. Should the customer request that a
larger meter be installed than that designated by the
utility, the customer shall pay any additional costs
incurred.
(C) (1) A by-pass around all new meter
installations shall be required under any of the
following circumstances, where:
(a) The service line on the outlet side
of the meter is one and 1½ inches or larger.
(b) The service line, regardless of size,
serves refrigeration equipment or the water supplied
is used for the purpose of cooling equipment; or
(c) The water service must not, for
any other reason, be interrupted while the meter is
being repaired or replaced.
(2) The by-pass shall be furnished and
installed by the customer according to the utility’s
specifications. Where existing piping not containing a
by-pass is altered to meet any of the above conditions,
the alternation shall also include the installation of a
by-pass.
(D) All meters or other appliances and
equipment which are furnished by and at the expense
of the utility and which may at any time be on the
customer’s premises are and shall remain the property
of the utility unless otherwise expressly provided
herein; the customer shall protect such property from
freezing and from loss or damage and no one who is
not a representative of the utility shall be permitted to
remove such property or tamper therewith. The
customer shall be liable and responsible for all
damages to such property.
(E) Meters may require repair from time to time,
in which case the following procedures may be
employed:
(1) Ordinary repairs to meters shall be
made by the utility without expense to the customer.
The customer or representative of such shall sign a
work order indicating that service has been provided
and that current reads have been verified. Failure or
refusal to sign the work order shall not negate any
charges incurred.
(2) Meter repairs and/or replacement
necessitated through customer neglect or negligence
shall be charged to the responsible customer/property
owner. Where a frozen meter must be replaced and
such is not discovered until after the utility account
has been finaled, the new party desiring service may
be held responsible for the cost of the repair or
replacement.
(F) (1) A meter shall be tested for accuracy by
the utility if the customer requests it. The utility shall
advise the customer to first investigate the premises
for other reasons for excessive water usage before
requesting removal of the meter for a shop test. If
leaks are found or if the meter test established the
accuracy of the meter to be between 98% and 102%,
the utility may charge the customer for making the
investigation and/or the test. Upon request, the
customer may have a representative present when the
investigation is made and/or the meter is tested.

customer has abnormally high billings or other
unusual unexplainable circumstances. A report of the
results of the meter shop test shall be kept by the
utility.
(G) The utility shall place seals on all water
meters, in and for any premises, and replace such
seals found broken or removed. Meter coupling locks
may be installed at the option of the utility where
tampering is suspected. The water supply may be
turned off if such seals are found to be broken or
removed. If such seals are found broken or removed,
or the meter itself is found to have been tampered with
or removed, the utility shall charge the customer three
times the average consumption for customers of that
class, for the period for which it is determined what
usage was not metered, or six months, whichever is
less. Further, in such circumstances the customer
may be prosecuted for theft of utility property and
services.
(H) Where water is taken through one meter
servicing a multi-unit dwelling, the utility requires the
owner/designated agent of the real property to
maintain the billing in said name.
(I) The utility will attempt to obtain at least one
inside read annually. Failure of the customer to
cooperate in obtaining this read shall absolve the
utility of this obligation and financial responsibility for
any meter problem which could have been discovered.

making repairs or replacements of utility’s facilities.
In case the supply of service is interrupted or sustains
other variations, utility shall not be liable to customer
for damages or losses resulting from such interruption
or variation in service, unless due to the gross
negligence of utility.
(B) Such interruptions or variations shall not
constitute a breach of any obligations of utility under
any agreement for service with customer.
(C) The utility shall not be responsible for water
in customer’s basement unless such water is the direct

(A) This chapter sets forth uniform requirements
for users of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works for
the City of Anderson and enables the city to comply
with all applicable state and federal laws, including the
Clean Water and the General Pretreatment Regulations
(40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 403). The
objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants
into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works that will
interfere with its operation;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants
into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works that will
pass through the Publicly Owned Treatment Works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or
otherwise be incompatible with the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works;
(3) To protect both Publicly Owned
Treatment Works personnel who may be affected by
wastewater and sludge in the course of their
employment and the general public;
(4) To promote reuse and recycling of
industrial wastewater and sludge from the Publicly
Owned Treatment Works;
(5) To provide for fees for the equitable
distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and
improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment
Works; and
(6) To enable the city to comply with its
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other federal or state laws to
which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works is
subject.
(B) This chapter shall apply to all users of the
Publicly Owned Treatment Works. This chapter
authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge
2011 S-8
permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires user reporting; and
provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.

(3) Rates for Inter-Municipal Users.
Inter-Municipal Users shall be charged for services
rendered by the sewage utility based upon the
following schedule of rates and charges. Bills shall be
rendered monthly. Flows for purposes of applying
metered rates shall be determined based upon a
wastewater meter in accordance with the following
schedule:
(a) Metered flow (from April 13, 2009
through December 31, 2009):
1. $2.2455 (per CCF); and
2. $3.0000 (per 1,000 gallons).
(b) Metered flow (from January 1
through December 31, 2010):
1. $4.4910 (per CCF); and
2. $6.0000 (per 1,000 gallons).
(c) Billing charge: $2.0900 (per bill).
(B) Annual review of service charges. Prior to
June 1 of each year, the Accounting Manager of the
sewage utility and/or an independent certified public
accountant employed for that purpose shall submit to
the Board of Public Works a comparison of the
calculated unit cost for flow, removal of BOD and
suspended solids per year, with the unit charges
currently in effect from which the Board shall
determine whether the current service charges and
surcharges are adequate or should be changed. The
methodology utilized in developing this cost
comparison shall include:
(1) A system including the distribution of
the cost of operation, maintenance, and replacement
of the treatment works of the utility to each user class
in proportion to such user’s contribution to the total
waste loading of the treatment works. Factors such as
strength, volume, and delivery flow characteristics
shall be considered and included as the basis for the
user’s contribution to insure a proportional distribution
of operation, maintenance, and replacement costs to
each user class.
2011 S-8
20 Anderson - Public Works
(2) Total annual service charges and
surcharges collected from each individual user class
shall be deemed sufficient if said charges have
generated during the prior operating period sufficient
revenue to offset the cost of all treatment works
operation and maintenance provided by the utility,
including cost of management, system repair and
replacement, debt retirement and other costs incidental
to the utility operation attributable to such class.
(C) Revision of rates of surcharge. Prior to June
1 of each year, the Accounting Manager of the sewage
utility and/or an independent certified public
accountant employed for that purpose shall submit to
the Board of Public Works a comparison of the
calculated unit costs for removing BOD and suspended
solids from the sewage treatment plant influent during
the previous calendar year with the unit charges
currently in effect in order that the Board may
determine whether the current rates of surcharge are
adequate or should be changed and request legislative
enactment of said changes by the Common Council.
(D) For the services rendered to the city, the city
shall be subject to the same rates and charges as
hereinbefore provided or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith.

building discharging sewage, industrial waste, water,
or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system,
either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water
supplied by the municipally owned water utility
serving the city and the water used thereon and therein
is not measured by a meter or is measured by a meter
not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water
used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the
city in order to ascertain the rates of charge, or the
owner or other interested party, at his expense, may
install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved
method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of the sewage discharge.
(C) In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or
building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial waste,
water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage
system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water
supplied by the municipally owned waterworks and in
addition uses water from another source which is not
measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water
meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of
water used shall be otherwise measured or determined
by the city in order to ascertain the rates of charge, or
the owner or other interested party, at his expense,
may install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved
method of measurement acceptable to the city for the
determination of sewage discharge.

(D) In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or
building discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste,
water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage
system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in
excess of 100,000 cubic feet per month and it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the city that a portion of
the water as measured by the water meter does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the
owner or other interested party shall install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices,
or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage
discharge.
(E) In the event two or more residential lots,
parcels of real estate, or buildings discharging sanitary
sewage, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary
sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users
of water and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter, then in such case, for billing
purposes, the quantity of water used shall be the
average for each user and the minimum charge and
the sewage rates and charges shall apply to each of the
number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or
buildings served through the single water meter.
(F) In order that the domestic and residential
users of sewage services shall not be penalized for
sprinkling lawns during the months of June, July, and
August, the billing for sewage services for residential
or domestic users for the months of June, July, and
August shall be based on the water usage for the
previous months of February, March, and April. In
the event the water usage for the previous months of
February, March, and April is greater than the water
usage of the months of June, July and August, then
the billing for sewage services shall be computed on
the actual water used in the month for which the
sewage service bill is being rendered. Domestic or
residential sewage services as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real
estate, or building which is occupied and used as a
residence. The sprinkling rate shall not apply to any
premises which are partially used for commercial or
industrial purposes. In the event a portion of such
premises shall be used for commercial or industrial
purposes the owner shall have the privilege of
separating the water services so that the residential
portion of the premises is served through a separate
water meter, and in such case the water usage as
registered by the water meter serving such portion of
the premises used for residential purposes would
qualify under the sprinkling rate.
(G) Where a metered water supply is used for
fire protection as well as for other uses, the city may,
in its discretion, make adjustments in the minimum
charge and in the use charge as may be equitable. In
such cases the burden of proof as to the type of water
usage shall be on the user.
(H) (1) For the purpose of this division and the
application of the rate formula, the following
definitions shall be utilized:
S. Strength charge in dollars.
V. Sewage volume in 100 cubic feet.
.00075. Factor to convert 100 cubic feet to
millions of gallons.

(2) The following monthly charges are
hereby imposed on the amount of excess suspended
solids or BOD strength determined by the application
of the formula prescribed below. The formula reads
as follows:
S - Vs times 0.00075 times 8.34 times (rate
established for BOD which is $0.27 [BOD minus 500]
together with the rate established for suspended solids
which is $0.24 [SS minus 500]).
(3) The computation of the total charges
under this division shall be by the application of the
volume rate formula and the excess strength waste rate
formula to the monthly waste discharges to the city
sanitary sewage system.

§ 51.22 SEWAGE RATES BASED ON
CONTENT OF DISCHARGE.
In order that the rates and charges may be justly
and equitably adjusted to the services rendered, the
city shall have the right to base its charges not only on
volume but also on the strength and character of the
sewage and waste which it is required to treat and
dispose of. The city shall have the right to measure
and determine the strength and content of all sewage
and waste discharge, either directly or indirectly, into
the city’s sanitary sewage system in such manner and
by such method as may be deemed practical in the
light of the conditions and attending circumstances of
the case in order to determine the proper charge.
Except as may be permitted by an ordinance
regulating the use of public and private sewers and
2010 S-7
Sewers 21
drains and the discharge of wastes into the public
sewer collection system for the City, and subject to
payment of the excess strength waste rate charges
provided for above, any and all commercial and
industrial installations shall be so controlled or treated
as to the sewage strength that their effluent discharge
to the city’s sewers shall have a BOD (biological
oxygen demand) not to exceed 500 parts per million
and suspended solids not to exceed 500 parts per
million at any time, which provisions are in general
agreement with the recommendations contained in the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management
“Facilities Planning Handbook.” The Board of
Public Works is authorized to prohibit the dumping of
wastes into the city’s sewage system which, in its
discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation of the
sewage disposal works of the city.

§ 51.23 BILLING AND COLLECTION OF
SEWAGE RATES.
(A) The rates and charges shall be prepared and
billed by the city and shall be collected in the manner
provided by law and ordinance. The rates and
charges may be billed to the tenant occupying the
property served unless requested in writing by the
owners, but such billing shall in no way relieve the
owners from liability in the event payment is not made
as herein required. The owners of property served
which are occupied by tenants shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the
purpose of determining whether such rates and
charges have been paid by such tenants, provided that
such examination shall be made at the office in which
the records are kept and during the hours that such
office is open for business.
(B) Except as provided hereinbefore for the
application of excess strength waste rate charge,
billing for sewage rates and charges shall be made
monthly and such rates and charges shall be based on
the quantity of water used on or in the property or
premises as the same is measured by the water meter
there in use, and the metered water usage shall be
determined from the meter readings as furnished by
the City Municipal Water Utility.

sewer connection is made any lot, parcel of real
estate, or building directly to a public or private sewer
suitable for use as a local or lateral sewer by that lot,
parcel of real estate, or building, precluding any
assessment therefor under the assessment laws of the
state (sometimes called the “Barrett Law” or a
contract sewer) against such lot, parcel of real estate,
or building for a local or lateral sewer, then and in
such case a connection charge in the amount of $500

sewer is outside the corporate limits of the city, then,
in such case, the connection charge shall be at a rate
of three times the connection charge of any such
connection within the corporate limits of the city for
each and every lot, parcel or building. Prior to
connection to the city’s Sanitary Sewer System, the
property owner outside of the city limits shall sign and
record a waiver of annexation.
(C) Definition. For the purposes of this section,
one EDU shall be defined as the average use of 9,300
gallons of water per month over one calendar year.
The present number of EDUs for various land uses
are listed in Exhibit A, partially excerpted from the
Indiana State Board of Health Bulletin S.E. 13, which
is attached hereto. Exhibit A shall be used to
determine the number of EDUs for all users unless the

interaction with other pollutants, will cause
interference with either the POTW; or any wastewater
treatment or sludge process, or which will constitute
a hazard to humans, animals or aquatic life.
(5) Heats in amounts which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW resulting in
interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that
the temperature entering the POTW Treatment Plant
exceeds 40E C (104E F).
(6) Petroleum oil or nonbiodegradable

user and payment of the applicable user charges and
fees and authorization by the agency.
(C) No discharger is allowed to increase the use
of potable or process water in any way, nor mix
separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
applicable standards.
(D) Except to the extent that it may be preempted
by the acts of state or federal agencies pursuant to
state or federal laws, rules, or regulations, the agency
may prohibit any discharge to the community sewer
collection system if it is not demonstrated that there is
sufficient capacity in all downstream sewers, lift
stations, force mains, and treatment plants, including
capacity for BOD5 and TSS, to accommodate any
person applying for a discharge permit pursuant to
§ 51.57. The person shall provide the information
deemed appropriate, as required by § 51.58, and upon
evaluation of such data, a permit may be issued as
provided. When wastewater subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not
regulated by the same standard, the agency shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(e)
(E) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is
expressed only in terms of either the mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Agency
may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with §§ 51.54(G) and 51.54(H).
2011 S-8
Sewers 30A
(F) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment
standard are expressed only in terms of mass of
pollutant per unit of production, the Agency may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or
effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial
users.
(G) When a categorical pretreatment standard is
expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an
industrial user may request that the Agency convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination
to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within
the discretion of the Agency. The Agency may
establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial
user meets all the conditions set forth in
§ 51.51(G)(l)(a) through 51.51(G)(l)(e) below.
(1) To be eligible for equivalent mass
limits, the industrial user must:
(a) Employ, or demonstrate that it will
employ water conservation methods and technologies
that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
(b) Currently use control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not
have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
(c) Provide sufficient information to
establish the facility’s actual average daily flow rate
for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the
facility’s long-term average production rate. Both the
actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of
current operating conditions;
(d) Not have daily flow rates,
production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
(e) Have consistently complied with all
applicable categorical pretreatment standards during
the period prior to the industrial user’s request for
equivalent mass limits.
(2) An industrial user subject to equivalent
mass limits must:
(a) Maintain and effectively operate
control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve
compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
(b) Continue to record the facility’s
flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent
flow monitoring device;
(c) Continue to record the facility’s
production rates and notify the Agency whenever
production rates are expected to very by more than 20
percent from its baseline production rates determined
in division (G)(l)(c) of this section. Upon notification
of a revised production rate, the Agency will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility;
and
(3) When developing equivalent mass
limits, the Agency:
(a) Will calculate the equivalent mass
limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate
of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by
the concentration-based faily maximum and monthly
average standard for the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
(b) Upon notification of a revised
production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit
and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
(c) May retain the same equivalent
mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater
discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result
of the implementation of water conservation methods
and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent
mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a
2011 S-8
30B Anderson - Public Works
substitute for treatment pursuant to § 51.54(D). The
industrial user must also be in compliance with
§ 51.562 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
(H) The Agency may convert the mass limits of
the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR
Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for
purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. The conversion is a the
discretion of the Agency. When converting such limits
to concentration limits, the Agency will use the
concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40
CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that
dilution is not being substituted for treatment as
prohibited by § 51.54(D). In addition, the Agency will
document how the equivalent limits were derived for
any changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice
versa, and make this information publicly available.
(I) Once included in its permit, the industrial
user must comply with the equivalent limitations
developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
(J) Many categorical pretreatment standards
specify one limit for calculating maximum daily
discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating
maximum monthly average, or four-day average,
limitations. Where such standards are being applied,
the same production or flow figure shall be used in
calculating both the average and the maximum
equivalent limitation.
(K) Any industrial user operating under a permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits
calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Agency within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the
production level will significantly change within the
next calendar month. Any user not notifying the
Agency of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in it permit that
were based on the original estimate of the long term
average production rate.

result in revocation of discharge permit.
(I) Charges will be based upon a minimum
charge or the actual gallonage discharged into the
treatment works, whichever is greater. Billing to the
haulers will be on a monthly basis by the agency.
(J) Effective January 1, 1988, septic tank
haulers shall be charged $4 per 100 gallons of septic
tank waste that is discharged at the city wastewater
treatment facility.
(1) In succeeding years, the Board of
Public Works shall have the option to increase said
charge up to 50% per year. Any such increase shall
go into effect on January 1, and shall be made by
resolution of the Board of Public Works. If the Board
of Public Works desires to increase charges to septic
tank haulers, it shall pass its resolution doing so at
least 30 days prior to the effective date of any such
increase.

§ 51.53 SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS.
(A) Specific pollutant limitations have been
adopted as follows. The following limits have been
established in cooperation with the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management and the
EPA to protect the integrity of the POTW and White
River within and beyond the city limits. All limits are
for total concentrations at the discharge location. All
limits are in mg/l unless otherwise noted.

(B) Where dilution from nonregulated sources
occurs, the combined waste stream formula set forth
in 40 CFR 403.6 (e) shall be used to calculate legal
limits. The details for determining legal limits after
dilution shall be regulated by wastewater discharge
permits issued to users subject to the above limits.
(C) Concentrations apply at the point where the
industrial waste is discharged to the POTW. All
concentrations for metallic substances are for “total”
metal unless indicated otherwise. Mass limitations
may be imposed in addition to or in place of the
concentration-based limitations above.
(D) The City of Anderson Water Pollution
Control may develop best management practices
(BMPs) by ordinance or in individual wastewater
discharge permits to implement local limits and the
requirements of § 51.51.

§ 51.54 HAZARDOUS WASTES.
(A) If any sewage is discharged, or proposed to
be discharged to the community sewer collection
system which contains the substances or possesses the
characteristics enumerated in § 51.51(A)(1) through
(14), and which in the judgment of the agency, may
have a deleterious effect upon wastewater treatment
and collection system, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the agency may
in writing:
(1) Reject the wastes;
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable
condition prior to discharge to the community sewers;
(3) Require flow equalization of the rate of
discharge; or
(4) Require payment to cover the added
cost of handling and treating the wastes not allowed in
this section under the provision of § 51.99(B)(3).
(B) National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) must be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories if they are more
stringent than state or local standards. All categorical
pretreatment standards must be met at the point of
discharge from the industrial pretreatment system
prior to mixing with any other waste stream.
(C) The Agency reserves the right to enter into
special agreements with industrial users setting out
special terms under which they may discharge to the
POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive
compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement. However, the industrial user may
request a net gross adjustment to a categorical
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The
2018 S-15
Sewers 32A
industrial user may also request a variance from the
categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a
request will be approved only if the industrial user can
prove that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by
EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard.
An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different
variance must comply with the procedural and
substantive provisions of 40 CFR 403.13.
(D) No industrial user shall ever increase the use
of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a
discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
2012 S-9
32B Anderson - Public Works
Sewers 33
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an
applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Agency may impose mass limitations on industrial
users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
(E) Limitations on wastewater strengths in
§ 51.53 may be supplemented with more stringent or
new standards or requirements on discharges to the
POTW:
(1) If the agency determines that the
limitations in § 51.53 may not be sufficient to protect
the operation of the wastewater treatment system; or
(2) If the agency determines that the
limitations in § 51.53 may not be sufficient to enable
the wastewater treatment plant to comply with water
quality standards or effluent limitations specified in
this National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
(NPDES) permit;
(3) The most stringent requirements,
whether federal, state or local, shall apply.

§ 51.55 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
(A) Each discharger must provide protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated
materials or substances. Where necessary, procedures
and facilities to prevent the accidental discharge of
prohibited materials must be provided and maintained
at the discharger’s expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities’ and operating procedures’ accidental
discharge protection must be submitted to the agency
before construction of the facility. Review and
approval of plans and operating procedures by the
agency will not relieve the discharger from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet applicable requirements.
(B) Every two years the Agency is required to
evaluate whether an industrial user needs to implement
an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Each
industrial user required to develop and implement an
accidental discharge/slug control shall submit to the
Agency a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the
following:
(1) Description of discharge practices,
including non-routine batch discharges.
(2) Description of stored chemicals.
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying
the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such
notification must also be given for any discharge
which would violate any of the prohibited discharges
in § 51.53.
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact
from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plan site run-off, worker
training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response.
(C) Significant industrial users are required to
notify the Agency immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for an accidental
discharge/slug discharge.

see § 51.99
§ 51.56 UPSET PROVISION.
(A) For the purposes of this section, UPSET
means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and contemporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user.
An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
2011 S-8
34 Anderson - Public Works
caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities,
lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
(B) An upset shall constitute an affirmative
defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards if the industrial user
can demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant
evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the industrial
user can identify the causes of the upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being
operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in
compliance with applicable operations and
maintenance procedures;
(3) The industrial user has submitted to the
POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset the following information (if this information
was provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
(a) A description of the discharge and
cause of non-compliance;
(b) The period of non-compliance,
including exact dates and times or, if not corrected,
the amount of time the non-compliance is expected to
continue;
(c) Action being implemented and/or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of
the non-compliance.

§ 51.562 BYPASS PROVISION.
For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
(A) (1) BYPASS. The intentional diversion of
wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user’s
treatment facility.
(2) SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.
Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which cause them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of
natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
(B) An industrial user may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only it if it also
essential for maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to divisions (C) and
(D).
(C) (1) If an industrial user knows in advance
of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to
the POTW at least ten days before the date of the
bypass if possible.
(2) An industrial user shall submit oral
notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment program requirements of the
POTW immediately but not later than 24 hours from
the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.
The written submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Agency may waive the written report on a case by
case basis if the oral report has been received within
24 hours.
(D) Bypass is prohibited, and the Agency may
take enforcement action against the industrial user for
a bypass unless:
(1) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss
of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2011 S-8
Sewers 35
(2) There was no feasible alternative to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
equipment should have been installed in the exercise
of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3) The industrial user submitted notices as
required under division (C).

§ 51.57 PRETREATMENT.
(A) In cases where the agency determines that
pretreatment will be required, facilities shall be
constructed, operated, and maintained at the user’s
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the agency and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management for review, and shall be
approved before construction of the facilities. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in
no way relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an acceptable discharge to the POTW under
the provisions of this code. Grease, oil or sand
interceptors shall be required at all restaurants and at
all industrial and commercial enterprises when, in the
opinion of the agency, they are necessary to contain
grease, flammable wastes or sand and other harmful
inert materials. All interceptors shall be approved by
the agency and shall be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. Log books and pumping
records shall be maintained and shall be readily
available for the review by the agency.
(B) The Agency may require any person
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on
their property and at their expense, a suitable storage
and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of
flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may
be issued solely for flow equalization.
(C) The review of plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the agency under the
provisions of this subchapter.
(D) Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method which may change the quality or
quantity of the pretreatment wastewater shall be
reported to and be acceptable to the agency and to all
divisions of the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management having jurisdiction.
(E) The agency reserves the right to refuse or
accept any or all industrial wastewaters from an
industry or combination of industries as may be
necessary to insure adequate treatment and proper
operation of the community wastewater collection
system. The agency may accept any or all
conventional industrial wastewaters from an industry
or a combination of industries provided that the
agency determines that constituents in the wastewaters
are compatible with the agency’s wastewater
collection system and treatment processes.
(F) All industrial users must submit information
on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater
by completing a wastewater survey prior to
commencing their discharge. The Agency is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may
periodically require industrial users to update the
survey. Failure to complete the survey shall be
reasonable grounds for terminating the service to the
industrial user and shall be considered a violation of
this code.

industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an
applicable standard, shall be required to submit to the
Agency a report which contains the information listed
in (C)(1) below. A new source shall also be required
to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use
to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new
source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants discharged. Users that
become subject to new or revised categorical
pretreatment standards are required to comply with the
following reporting requirements even if they have
been designated as a non-significant categorical
industrial user.
(1) The industrial user shall submit with the
baseline monitoring report the information listed
below:
(a) Name and address of the facility
including the name of operators and owners.
(b) Any environmental control permits
held by or for the facility.
(c) A description of the operation
including:

2. Average rate of production;
3. S t a n d a r d i n d u s t r i a l
classifications of all operations;
4. Flow rates in gallons per day
for process wastestreams, dilution wastestreams and
non-regulated wastestreams containing regulated
pollutants;
5. Identity of each categorical
pretreatment standard and concentration of regulated
pollutants in each wastestream;
6. A statement reviewed by the
facility authorized representative and certified by a
Professional Engineer as to compliance status;
7. A compliance schedule if
additional construction or operation and maintenance
is necessary.
(d) Measurement of pollutant:
1. The user shall identify the
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated
process;
2. In addition, the user shall
submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying
the nature and concentration (or mass, where required
by the standard or Control Authority) of regulated
pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be
reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. In cases where the standard requires
compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the Control Authority or
the applicable standards to determine compliance with
the standard;
3. The user shall take a minimum
of one representative sample to compile that data
necessary to comply with the requirements of this
division (C)(1)(d).
4. Samples should be taken
immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities
if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other
wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater
prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
2011 S-8

combined wastestream formula of § 403.6(e) in order
to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass
limit has been calculated in accordance with
§ 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the Control Authority.
5. Sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments
thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the Administrator determines that
the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures
suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by
the Administrator.
6. The Control Authority may
allow the submission of a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need
for industrial pretreatment measures.
7. The baseline report shall
indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and
methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
(D) Compliance schedule reports (categorical
users). All users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards and who are required to submit a
compliance schedule, are to submit a compliance
schedule containing the following dates:
(1) Date for hiring an engineer;
(2) Completing preliminary plans;
(3) Completing final plans;
(4) Executing contracts;
(5) Commencing construction;
(6) Completing construction; and
(7) Final compliance.
A progress report must be submitted not later than 14
days following each compliance schedule deadline.
(E) Report on compliance with pretreatment
standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date
for final compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any industrial user subject to those
standards must submit to the agency and the approval
authority a report containing the information described
in § 51.62(C). For all industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
equivalent mass or concentration limits established in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall
contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user’s
long-term production rate. All other industrial users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation) shall
include with this report the industrial user’s actual
production during the appropriate sampling period.
All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 51.62(C).
(F) Periodic compliance reports.
(1) All significant industrial users must, at
a frequency determined by the City of Anderson
Water Pollution Control submit no less than twice per
year, in June and December or as specified by permit,
reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting
period. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a best management practice
(BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the City of
Anderson Water Pollution Control, or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user.

(2) The City of Anderson Water Pollution
Control may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling
of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment
standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present
in the discharge, or is present only at background
levels from intake water and without any increase in
the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
(a) The waiver may be authorized
where a pollutant is determined to be present solely
due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated
by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise
includes no process wastewater.
(b) The monitoring waiver is valid
only for the duration of the effective period of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new
request for the waiver before the waiver can be can be
granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
(G) Records retention. Users subject to the
reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and
make available for inspection and copying, all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by this chapter, any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user
independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with best management practices established
under § 51.53(D). Records shall include the date,
exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the
name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods use;
and the results of such analyses. These records shall
remain available for a period of at least three years.
This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or the
city, or where the user has been specifically notified
of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.
(H) Users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards shall report any planned increase or
decrease in production at least two days prior to the
planned change in production.
(1) The Agency may require the industrial
user to submit information deemed necessary to
evaluate the changed condition, including submission
of a wastewater discharge permit application in
accordance with § 51.59.
(2) The Agency may issue a wastewater
discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit in accordance with § 51.58.
(3) Flow increases of 10% or greater and
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall
be deemed significant for purposes of this
requirement.
(4) No industrial user shall implement any
significant planned change without a response to the
request from the Agency.
(I) Reports from non-significant industrial
users. All non-significant industrial users (not subject
to categorical pretreatment standards and not required
to get a wastewater discharge permit) shall provide
appropriate reports to the Agency as may be required.
(J) Notice of violation/repeat sampling and
reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial
user indicates a violation, the industrial user must
notify the Agency within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat
the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Agency within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user
is not required to resample if the Agency performs
monitoring at the industrial discharge at least once per
month or if the Agency performs sampling between
the industrial user’s initial sampling and when the
industrial user receives the results of the sampling. If
the city performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat
sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the
violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis.

(K) Notification of the discharge of hazardous
waste.
(1) (a) Any industrial user who
commences the discharge of a hazardous waste shall
notify the Agency, the USEPA Region V Waste
Management Division Director, and the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management Hazardous
Waste Management Director in writing of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include:
1. The name of the hazardous
waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
2. The EPA hazardous waste
number;
3. The type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other);
(b) If the industry discharges more
than 10 kilograms of such waste per calendar month
to the POTW the notification shall also contain the
following information to the extent that is known by
the industrial user:
1. An identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;
2. An estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream
discharged during the following 12 months;
(c) All notifications must take place no
later than 180 days after the discharge commences.
Any notification under this division (K) need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under division (L)
below. The notification requirement under this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported
under the self-monitoring requirements of divisions
(C) through (F) above.
(2) Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of divisions (L) during a calendar month
in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of
non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time
notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of
any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations
under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the
industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA
Region V Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and the Indiana Department of
Environmental Management Hazardous Waste
Management Director of the discharge of such
substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made
under this section, the industrial user shall certify that
is has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree
it has determined to be economically practical.
(L) All wastewater discharge permit
applications. User reports and certification statements
must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the certification statement in
§ 51.62(A). If the designation of an authorized
representative is no longer accurate because a
different individual or position has responsibility for
the overall operation of the facility or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the
company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of this section must be submitted to [the
Superintendent] prior to or together with any reports
to be signed by an authorized representative. A facility
determined to be a non-significant categorical
industrial user pursuant to § 51.50 must annually
submit the signed certification statement in
§ 51.62(N).

(A) Discharge of wastewater in any manner
which violates this subchapter or any order issued
pursuant to it, shall constitute a violation punishable
by § 51.99.
2018 S-15
44 Anderson - Public Works
(B) It is the responsibility of the industrial user
to report any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine,
episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or
a slug load which may cause potential problems for
the POTW, including violation of the prohibited
discharge standards in § 51.51. This notification shall
include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken by the industrial user. Whenever a
discharge of wastewater is in violation of the
provisions of this subchapter or the provisions of a
wastewater discharge permit, or otherwise causes or
threatens to cause a condition of contamination,
pollution, or nuisance, the agency may issue an order
to cease and desist, and direct that those persons not
complying with the prohibitions, limits, requirements,
or provisions to:
(1) Comply forthwith;
(2) Comply in accordance with a time
schedule set forth by the agency; or
(3) Take appropriate remedial or preventive
action in the event of a threatened violation.
(C) When the agency finds that a discharge of
wastewater has been taking place, in violation of
prohibitions or limitations prescribed in this
subchapter, or wastewater source control
requirements, effluent limitations or pretreatment
standards, or the provisions of a wastewater discharge
permit, the agency may require the user to submit for
approval, with such modification as it deems
necessary, a detailed time schedule of specific actions
which the user shall take in order to prevent or correct
a violation of requirements.
(D) When a discharge of wastes causes an
obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to
agency facilities, the agency may assess a charge
against the user for the work required to clean or
repair the facility and add the charge to the user’s
charges and fees.
(E) Users shall notify the agency immediately
upon accidentally discharging waste in violation of this
subchapter. Failure to notify the Agency of potential
problems shall be deemed a separate violation of this
code.
(F) Within five days following the discharge,
users shall, unless waived by the Agency, submit a
detailed written report describing the cases of the
discharge and measures taken by the industrial user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notifications
do not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the industrial user of any
fines, or other liability which may be imposed by this
code.
(G) The notification will not relieve users of
liability for any expense, loss, or damage to the sewer
system, treatment plant, or treatment process, or for
any fines imposed by the agency in accordance with

§ 51.64 MONITORING FACILITIES.
(A) The agency may require the user to construct
at his own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the
building sewer or internal drainage systems and may
also require sampling or metering equipment to be
provided, installed, and operated at the user’s
expense. The cost of monitoring activities by city
personnel may be charged to the user. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the
user’s premises, but the agency may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship
on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
(B) If the monitoring facility is inside the user’s
fence, there shall be accommodations to allow access
for agency personnel. There shall be ample room in
or near sampling manholes to allow for accurate
sampling and compositing of samples.
(C) Analytical requirements. All pollutant
analyses, including sampling techniques, to be
submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with methods approved by
EPA.
(1) Sample collection. Samples for oil and
grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity,
sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be grab
samples. Cyanides may be collected by composite
sampling techniques if the absence of sulfide has been
documented. All other parameters must be sampled
using flow proportional composite sampling
techniques. Where flow proportional composite
sampling is unfeasible, the Agency may authorize time
proportional sampling. A minimum of four grab
samples (per discharge duration or 24 hours,
whichever is shorter) may be authorized by the
Agency where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. Grab samples may be used to show
noncompliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(D) Sample collection.
(1) Except as indicated in division (D)(2)
and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater
samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Agency. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
samples must be representative of the discharge.
Using protocol, including appropriate preservation
specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a
24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters
unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Agency as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous limits.
(2) Unless otherwise specified samples for
oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals,
including BTEX, must be grab samples. Cyanides
may be collected by composite sampling techniques if
the absence of sulfide has been documented.
(3) For sampling required in support of
baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports
required in divisions (C) and (E) of § 51.62, a
minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the
Agency may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by § 51.62(F), the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples

§ 51.65 INSPECTION.
(A) The agency may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
subchapter is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises
where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow
the agency or its representative ready access at all
reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the
purpose of inspection or sampling or in the
performance of any of their duties.
(B) The agency shall have the right to set up on
the user’s property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a
user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before
entry into their premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with their security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the agency will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
(C) The agency and its representatives shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the company, and the company shall be
held harmless for injury or death to agency
employees. The agency shall indemnify the company
against loss or damage to its property by agency
employees, against liability claims and demands by
agency employees, and against liability claims and
demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the company and growing out of the
gauging and sampling operation, except as such may
be caused by negligence or failure of the company to
maintain safe conditions.
(D) The agency may require the industrial user
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facilities sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the industrial user at his own expense.
All devices to measure wastewater flow shall be
calibrated periodically to insure their accuracy.
(E) Any temporary obstruction to safe and easy
access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or
sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial
user to the verbal or written request of the agency and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be born by the industrial user.
(F) The agency may use digital photography
during an inspection.
(G) Unreasonable delays in allowing agency
personnel access to the industrial users premises shall
be a violation of this chapter.

§ 51.66 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
(A) All information and data on a user obtained
from reports, questionnaires, monitoring programs,
and inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restrictions unless
the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the agency that the
release of this information would divulge information,
processes, or methods which would be detrimental to
the user’s competitive position.
(B) Information which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public upon request by the user,
but shall be made available to governmental agencies
for use in making studies, judicial review, or in
enforcement proceedings involving the user.

§ 51.67 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.
(A) The agency may revoke, after providing
reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing, any
wastewater discharge permit, or terminate or cause to
be terminated wastewater service to any premises if a
violation of any provision of this subchapter is found
to exist or if it appears to the agency that an actual or
threatened discharge presents an imminent danger to
the welfare of persons, the environment, or the
operation of the POTW. If the user fails to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, within the time
period determined by the agency, the agency must
immediately commence judicial proceedings to make
the user comply with the order. The agency can
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit or
wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial
proceedings provided the user can prove elimination
of the problem.
(B) Any user, permit applicant, or permit holder
affected by any decision, action, or determination,
including cease and desist orders, made by the
agency, interpreting or implementing the provisions of
this subchapter or in any permit issued herein, may
file with the agency a written request for
reconsideration within ten days of the decision, action,
or determination, setting forth in detail the facts
supporting the user’s request for reconsideration.
This request for reconsideration and a final
determination by the agency shall be a condition
precedent to the relief provided for in division (C)
below.
(C) Any person aggrieved by any decision,
action, or determination by the agency, including a
decision upon a request for reconsideration, shall have
the right to judicial review, with the Circuit or
Superior Courts of Madison County, within 30 days
after the making of the decision, action, or
determination. The agency’s decision, action, or
determination shall remain in effect during the
pendency of such judicial review, unless the court first
shall find there is no significant hazard to health or
risk of damage to the agency’s wastewater collection
system or treatment facilities, in which event the court
may stay or supersede the effect of the decision,
action, or determination upon the parties of such bond
as the court may determine and order.
(D) When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may petition
through the City Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of
the user. The Superintendent may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against a user.

A stormwater service charge shall be imposed on
each and every lot and parcel of land within the city
which directly or indirectly contributes to the
stormwater system of the city, which charge shall be
assessed against the property owner thereof, who shall
be considered the user for the purposes of this
chapter. This charge is deemed reasonable and is

(Ord. 77-01 passed 1-10-02)
§ 51A.05 STORMWATER SERVICE RATE
ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES.
(A) Charge per ERU. The stormwater service
charge shall be $3.50 per ERU per month. For the
purpose of this chapter, a month shall be considered
25 through 35 days. Any billings for stormwater
service outside this time shall be on a per diem basis.
(B) Basis for charge. The stormwater service
charge is designed to recover the cost of rendering
stormwater service to the users of the stormwater
system, and shall be the basis for assessment of the
stormwater service charge. This rate is established so
as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for
reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing
services, as well as variations in the demand for
services.
(Ord. 77-01 passed 1-10-02)
§ 51A.06 RATE STRUCTURE AND
CALCULATION.
(A) Generally. For the purposes stated in
§§ 51A.02 and 51A.05 there is hereby assessed a
stormwater service charge for each property owner
owning land situated within the corporate limits of the
city that contributes directly or indirectly to the
stormwater system of the city, in an amount as
determined below.
(B) Impervious area. For any such property,
lot, parcel of land, building or premises which
contribute directly or indirectly to the stormwater
system of the city, such charge shall be based upon
the quantity of impervious area situated thereon.
Impervious area of public. rights-of-way and railroad
lines (which shall not be deemed to include adjacent
property, such as a railyard operated by a railroad),
will not be included in the determination of a
stormwater service charge. In addition, the department
shall establish policies and procedures to make
determinations whether commonly-owned, adjoining
properties with separate plat or legal descriptions
should be treated as a single parcel of land for
purposes of calculating the stormwater service fees to
be charged for such properties.
(C) Classification of property. All properties
within the city will be assigned an Equivalent
Residential Unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, with all
properties having impervious area assigned at least
one ERU (except as otherwise provided in
§ 51A.06(E) below), as follows:
52 Anderson - Public Works
(1) Single-family residential properties. A
monthly flat-rate charge for stormwater service
rendered to single-family residential properties shall
be assessed to each single-family residential parcel
within the city limits. All single-family residential
properties are hereby assigned one ERU.
(2) Other properties. Properties with
impervious area other than those containing a singlefamily
residence will be assigned an ERU multiple
based on the total amount of impervious area on the
property (measured in square feet) divided by 2,500
square feet. ERU multiples, after taking into
consideration any credits granted as provided in
§ 51A.09 of this chapter, shall be rounded to nearest
whole integer.
(D) Land alterations. The issuance of any
building permit or other action which results in a land
alteration of a property other than a single-family
residential property or a property that currently only
contains a single-family residence but will be no
longer used for such purpose shall be cause for an
adjustment of the stormwater service charge
determined under this section. The property owner
shall have the obligation of informing the department
of any such changes.
(E) Exceptions/exemptions. Except for public
rights-of-way and railroad lines, there shall be no
exceptions or exemptions from the assignment of
gross stormwater ERUs for any property with
impervious area except that properties other than
single- family residential parcels with impervious area
of less than 500 square feet shall be exempted from
the assignment of an ERU.
(Ord. 77-01 passed 1-10-02)
§ 51A.07 BILLINGS; TERMS OF PAYMENT.
(A) Billings. All stormwater service bills shall
be rendered on a monthly basis unless additional or
prorated billing is required to reflect customer
changes, initial billings or is otherwise required to
adjust billing cycles. Charges for miscellaneous
services or work performed on behalf of a stormwater
customer by the department shall be assessed at the
time the work is completed and shall be included in
the customer’s next stormwater service bill.
Stormwater billing for a new property shall commence
with the billing for water service, the meter set date or
date of occupancy whichever shall first occur.
Additional stormwater charges for an established
service address necessitated by a change in the amount
of impervious area at the property shall commence on
the date the new certificate of occupancy or
compliance is issued. Billing adjustments required to
correct impervious area measurements shall be applied
retroactively to the date of the customer’s initial
protest. Billing adjustments required to implement
credits under § 51A.09 of the chapter shall be applied
retroactively to the date of the customer’s application.
Adjustments shall be made by crediting the stormwater
service charge portion of the customer’s utility
account until any overpayment has been fully repaid.
If the adjustment is greater than the total of that
customer’s previous two month’s billings for
stormwater services, the city utilities department will
issue a refund check for the adjustment amount upon
written request to such department.
(B) Rights and responsibilities of property
owner. The provisions of the following subsection are
applicable only to residential leaseholds of a singlefamily
dwelling unit, and shall not be applicable to
commercial leaseholds or residential leaseholds of
structures containing more than one dwelling unit. The
rates and charges may be billed to the tenant
occupying the property served if evidence is presented
in writing to the utility office that the tenant has
agreed to pay these rates and charges. The owners of
property served which are occupied by tenants shall
have the right to examine the collection records of the
city for the purpose of determining whether such rates
and charges have been paid by such tenants. Charges
for stormwater service shall remain the ultimate
responsibility of the property owner, including all
penalties, recording fees, attorney’s fees, interest and
court costs. Other than the property owner, no other
person shall be permitted to inspect, examine or
otherwise obtain confidential information including the
social security number of the property owner obtained
by the city utility for the sole purpose of billing for
stormwater system service. For properties with
inactive utility accounts where no water charges have
been generated for 60 days or more, a stormwater
only account number will be issued to such property,
Stormwater Management 53
payable by the owner of said property, until water
charges have been reinstated. Stormwater service
charges attach to the property, provided, however,
that if a property owner sells or otherwise transfers
such property billed for stormwater service, such
property owner shall be responsible for the payment
of all bills rendered for stormwater service until
written notice of the transfer has been provided to the
city utility department and the account may properly
be transferred to another customer.
(C) Terms of payment. The stormwater service
charges prescribed in § 51A.06 shall be due on the
payment date set out on the bill. It shall be a violation
of this chapter to fail to pay a stormwater service bill
when due. All bills for stormwater services not paid
on or before the due date, shall be subject to a
collection or deferred payment charge of 10% on the
outstanding balance. Moving from one location to
another in no way absolves the customer from
responsibility for any unpaid charges incurred at a
previous location.

§ 51A.08 APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.
If, in the opinion of any single-family residential
property owner, the ERU multiple assigned to the
property of such owner is inaccurate in light of the
amount of impervious area contained on said property,
such property owner shall have the right to contest
such ERU determination. The Department shall
develop and promulgate policies and procedures to
resolve any such contests, including, as determined
necessary, the conducting of hearings and the making
of determinations with respect to the measurement of
impervious area contained on any property.
(Ord. 77-01 passed 1-10-02)
§ 51A.09 CREDIT POLICIES AND
PROCEDURE.
Currently the city requires all developments to
meet certain minimum detention criteria. Properties
that meet such criteria will receive a 25% credit.
Properties that meet the minimum city requirements
plus achieve additional detention will receive up to an
aggregate total of 40% credit for stormwater
detention. An additional 10% credit can be obtained
for water quality measures implemented by the
property owner. The minimum stormwater service
charge shall remain one ERU, even if the credit or
credits reduce the ERU multiple below one ERU. The
following outlines the criteria for each level of credit.
(A) Minimum detention criteria. The city
currently requires that all new developments meet the
following criteria:
(1) Developed discharge not to exceed five
years predeveloped rate; and
(2) Development must provide retention or
detention of 25 years developed rate on site through
inline storage, pond or parking lot.
Properties that meet these criteria shall receive a 25%
credit. The department shall develop policies and
procedures for documenting compliance with the
requirements for this credit, including provisions for
extending the credit for properties with improvements
built prior to the date that detention/retention was
required but which has a basin in use. All drainage
facilities shall be in approved drainage easements
before any credit will be allowed. In addition, all
drainage facilities shall be maintained by the property
owner and verified on annual inspections for the
property owner to maintain established credit.
Inspections shall be performed annually. In the event
of non-compliance, the property owner shall be
54 Anderson - Public Works
notified and given 30-60 days, depending on the
severity of the non-compliance, to remediate the
deficiencies and respond. If such noncompliance has
not been remediated by the expiration date of the
remediation period given to the property owner, the
credit shall be forfeited and the property owner must
reapply to obtain a new credit.
(B) Maximum detention criteria. In addition to
the minimum detention credit, a property owner may
receive up to an additional 15% credit if the owner’s
stormwater facilities exceed the city minimum
detention requirements in the manner hereinafter
described. By increasing capacity on-site, these
detention efforts reduce the demand and stress on the
downstream drainage facilities. The city shall credit
up to an additional 15% for facilities that meet the
following criteria:
Criteria Credit
(1) Provide an additional
20% volume storage 4%
(2) Provide a reduction in
developed peak runoff
rate by 20% 4%
(3) Provide storage for 100-
year events 4%
(4) Provide extended storage
with the potential for
ground water recharge 3%
The department shall develop policies and procedures
for documenting compliance with the requirements for
the credits described in this division.
(C) Volume credit. Properties that provide
additional volume under the emergency spillway of the
detention facility shall receive up to an additional 4%
credit. To receive this credit, the applicant must
provide the calculations and data necessary to quantify
the additional storage volume. The credit is calculated
by determining the minimum detention volume
required by the city and comparing it to the volume
provided. The additional credit shall be calculated
based on the following table:
Table 51A.09(C) - Volume Credit
Additional Volume Provided Credit
20% or Greater 4%
15-20% 3%
10-15% 2%
5-10% 1%
0-5% 0%
(D) Peak reduction credit. Properties that
provide additional decrease in peak flow rate shall
receive up to an additional 4% credit. The credit is
calculated by determining the required peak outflow to
meet the city requirements and comparing it to the
designed peak outflow. The additional credit shall be
calculated based on the following table:
Table 51A.09(D) - Peak Reduction Credit
Additional Reduction in Peak Credit
20% or Greater 4%
15-20% 3%
10-15% 2%
5-10% 1%
0-5% 0%
(E) 100-year storage credit. Properties that
provide additional storage to contain a 100-year event
without flowing through the emergency spillway will
receive up to an additional 4% credit. This credit is
applied only if the pond is designed to contain the
100-year design flow, without flowing over the
emergency spillway. If this design criteria is met then
an additional 4% will be added to the minimum credit.
(F) Extended storage credit. Properties that
provide extended storage greater than 24 hours will
receive up to 3% additional credit. The credit will be
calculated by determining the time it takes the pond to
drain from its peak elevation to the original time to
peak of the undeveloped conditions. The additional
credit percentage will be determined by the following
table:
Stormwater Management 55
Table 51A.09(F) - Extended Storage Credit
Detention Time Provided Credit
24 hrs. or greater 3%
16-24 hrs. 2%
8-16 hrs. 1%
0-8 hrs. 0%
(G) Water quality credit. Properties that provide
measures that improve the quality of stormwater that
leaves the property will receive up to an additional
10% above the maximum 40% for stormwater
quantity. This credit can apply to property owners
who are required to maintain individual NPDES
industrial permits. All applicants for the water quality
credit will be required to provide copies of past Site
Compliance Evaluations and the most current Site
Compliance Evaluations to maintain this credit. The
department shall develop policies and procedures to
establish standards for the granting of the water
quality credit.
(H) Payment required. Application for any one
or more credits or any appeal of the determination or
determinations made in respect thereto shall not
constitute a valid reason for non-payment by the user
of the originally assessed stormwater service charge.
(I) Appeals. Determinations regarding credits
for a user may be appealed in the same manner as will
be established by the department for appeals of ERU
determinations pursuant to § 51A.08 of this chapter.
(J) Inspections. Any party requesting a credit
shall permit the department and its agents to undertake
any inspection or inspections needed in the discretion
of the Department to determine whether any one or
more credits are appropriate. The department further
reserves the right to inspect periodically all storm
drainage control facilities of a user that has received
one or more credits to ascertain whether such facilities
are operating properly. If such facilities, due to
improper maintenance or any other reason, fails to
meet the criteria required for any credit, the
superintendent shall issue an order to complete the
repairs of such facilities within 60 days. If such
repairs are not completed within the 60-day period,
the superintendent, in his or her sole discretion, may
issue an order eliminating or reducing detention
credits to an appropriate level. Any such facility shall
not be eligible to reapply for credit adjustments for a
period of 12 months following any credit reduction or
elimination ordered by the superintendent.
(K) Land alteration. The issuance of any
building permit or other action which results in land
alteration with respect to a property receiving any one
or more credits under this section shall be cause for an
adjustment, as appropriate, of the credits to which the
owner may be entitled. The property owner shall have
the obligation of informing the department of any such
changes in the manner prescribed.
(Ord. 77-01 passed 1-10-02)
§ 51A.10 STORMWATER REVENUE FUND.
(A) All revenues earned and fees collected for

charges and are payable at the office of utility or to its
authorized collection agencies.
(B) All bills are rendered as “net” bills, which
will be subject to a late payment charge determined as
specified in § 52.30. When the due date falls on the
weekend or any day utility office not open for
business, due date is extended to the next day on
which utility office is open for business.
2019 S-17
Electric Service 65
(C) Failure to receive a bill shall not entitle
customer to pay the net bill after the designated date
has passed. Upon request, utility will inform customer
of the approximate date on which customer should
receive the bill each month and, if the bill is lost,
utility will issue a duplicate.
(D) Final bills will be due and payable at the
time of discontinuance of service or due date on bill.
When utility is unable to obtain the reading of a meter
after reasonable effort, it may estimate the reading and
render a bill, so marked. In the event that the meter
has been estimated four consecutive months, utility
has the right to disconnect until egress has been made.
In the event utility’s meter fails to register properly
for any reason, utility shall estimate customer’s
energy use and/or other bill determinates during the
period of failure based on such factors as customer’s
normal load and energy usage during a like
corresponding period.
(E) Checks returned for NSF.
(1) When utility is required to reprocess a
check rendered for payment of customer’s bill due to
non-sufficient funds, the payment amount will be
posted back to the account along with a NSF fee equal
to amount specified in § 52.30. A certified letter
giving customer ten days to pay the face amount of the
check plus the NSF fee will be mailed to customer. If
the certified letter is returned to the office unclaimed
or customer fails to pay the face amount of the check
plus the NSF fee within ten days, the utility may
disconnect service immediately.
(2) If two checks for payment of customer’s
account are returned for NSF within a 12-month
period, customer is required to pay only by cash or
guaranteed funds drafts (i.e. cashier’s check, e-check,
auto draft, ACH or money orders) for a period of one
year. During that time any payment submitted by
check will be rejected for payment, customer will be
responsible for any late payment charges incurred for
untimely payment.
(3) Utility has discretion to waive the fees,
order reconnection, stop disconnection and suspend
legal action, if utility determines in its sole discretion
there is a justifiable reason the check returned. Proof
of a justifiable reason satisfactory to utility must be
given in writing.

discontinued.
(4) Utility may at any time during the
12-month period adjust the estimate so made and the
bills rendered in accordance with such estimate to
conform more nearly to the actual use of service. The
normal equal payment period will be 12 months
commencing in any month selected by the utility. In
those cases where billing is commenced during a
month which leaves less than 12 months until the
beginning of the next normal equal payment period to
which customer is assigned, payments shall be
calculated on the basis of the months in such period.
(5) In case the actual service used during
any equal payment period exceeds the bills as

before the due date of the bill covering the last month
of the equal payment period in which such excess
appears or such excess may be added to the estimated
use for the next normal equal payment period. If
customer discontinues service with utility under the
budget plan any such excess not yet paid shall become
payable immediately.
(6) In case the actual service used during
the equal payment period is less than the amount paid
under the budget plan during such period, the amount

either refunded or credited to customer at the end of
the period.
(7) If customer fails to pay bills as rendered
on the budget plan, utility shall have the right to
withdraw the plan with respect to such customer and
to restore customer to billings as provided for the

(L) When utility has discontinued service for
nonpayment of a bill, temporary removal of meters,
changes in service or for any other cause, utility
reserves the right to charge customer an amount for
reconnection commensurate with the cost of such
reconnection, but in no event will such charge be less
than applicable regular or overtime working hours
rates specified in § 52.30.
(M) If such service occurs during non-working
business or regular hours other than the standard

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.001 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be referred
to as the “Storm Water Drainage Ordinance, City of
Anderson, Indiana” and shall hereafter be referred to
as “this chapter.”
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.002 PURPOSE.
(A) This chapter establishes standards for the
planning and design of drainage systems and storm
water control facilities within the jurisdictional area of
the city. The purpose of this chapter is to control
storm water drainage facilities, grading, excavation,
clearing, and other alterations of land in order to limit
the dangers of personal injury or property damage that
may be caused by storm water runoff.
(B) This chapter also establishes standards to
reduce non-point source pollutant loads to Waters of
the State located within the jurisdiction of the city to
the maximum extent practicable in order to protect
public health and safety and enhance water quality.
(C) It is recognized that smaller streams and
drainage channels serving the city may not have
sufficient capacity to receive and convey storm water
runoff, as land changes from agricultural or open use
to a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that
deposits of sediment from developments during and
after construction activities can reduce capacities of
storm water drainage systems and result in damages to
receiving waters. With this chapter, the city has a
policy that storage and controlled release of storm
water runoff will be required of all new development,
redevelopment and other construction in the city’s
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.003 REGULATORY AUTHORITY.
This chapter regulates:
(A) Storm water drainage improvements related
to development or redevelopment of lands located
within the jurisdiction of the city.
(B) Erosion and sediment control systems
installed during new construction or redevelopment
and grading of lots and other parcels of land.
(C) The design, construction, and maintenance
of storm water drainage facilities and systems.
(D) Prohibited discharges to the city municipal
storm sewer system or Waters of the State.

STORM WATER RUNOFF CONTROL
REQUIREMENTS
§ 54.050 DESIGN OF STORM WATER
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
The following storm water management practices
should be reviewed in developing site storm water
management plans in the following order:
(A) Protect and preserve as much natural or
vegetated area on the site as possible, minimizing
impervious surfaces, and directing runoff to vegetated
areas rather than to adjoining streets, storm sewers
and ditches;
(B) Flow attenuation of storm water by use of
open vegetated swales and natural depressions;
(C) Storm water wet detention facilities
(including percolation facilities); and
(D) Other storm water management practices
including but not limited to underground storage
facilities.
(E) A combination of successive practices may
be used to achieve applicable minimum control
requirements per the City Engineer’s approval.
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.051 POLLUTION CONTROL BEST
MANAGEMENT PRACTICE
REQUIREMENTS.
(A) The requirements in this section apply to all
development or redevelopment where vehicles,
equipment, or tanks are refueled on the premises;
whether a large-sized gas station, a single-pump
maintenance yard, or a small-sized fuel tank. A fuel
dispensing facility is defined as the area where fuel is
transferred from bulk storage tanks to vehicles,
equipment, and/or mobile containers (including fuel
islands, above- or below-ground fuel tanks, fuel
pumps, and the surrounding pad). Propane tanks are
exempt from these requirements.
(B) Requirements.
(1) Cover. The fuel dispensing area shall
be covered with a permanent canopy, roof, or awning
so precipitation cannot come in contact with the
fueling activity area. Rainfall shall be directed from
the cover to an approved storm water control.
(a) Covers ten feet high or less shall
have a minimum overhang of three feet on each side.
The overhang shall be measured relative to the
2006 S-3
Storm Water Drainage 109
perimeter of the hydraulically isolated fueling activity
area it is to cover.
(b) Covers higher than ten feet shall
have a minimum overhang of five feet on each side.
The overhang shall be measured relative to the
perimeter of the hydraulically isolated fueling activity
area it is to cover.
(2) Pavement. A paved fueling pad of
asphalt or concrete shall be placed under and around
the fueling activity area and shall meet all applicable
building code requirements. Sizing of the paved area
shall be adequate to cover the activity area, including
placement and number of the vehicles or pieces of
equipment to be fueled by each pump. Fuel pumps
shall be located a minimum of seven feet from the
edge of the fueling pad.
(3) Drainage. The paved area beneath the
perimeter of the cover shall be hydraulically isolated
through grading, berms, or drains. This will prevent
uncontaminated storm water from running onto the
area and carrying pollutants away. Drainage from the
hydraulically isolated area shall be directed to an
approved city sanitary sewer or authorized
pretreatment facility. Surrounding runoff shall be
directed away from the hydraulically isolated fueling
pad to a storm water control that meets all storm water
management requirements of this chapter and other
applicable rules, regulations and laws.
(4) Installation of spill control manhole. A
spill control manhole shall be installed on the
discharge line of the fueling pad (before the domestic
waste line tie-in). The tee section shall extend 18
inches below the outlet elevation, and 60 cubic feet of
storage volume shall be provided below the outlet
elevation for storage of oil, grease, and solids. The
manhole shall be located on private property. For
more information about spill control manholes contact
the Pretreatment Section of the City Water Pollution
Control Department.
(5) Installation of Shut Off Valves. Fueling
pads require a valve downstream of the spill control
manhole. Valves installed on sanitary sewer systems
shall be installed before the domestic waste line tie-in.
These valves shall be kept closed, and opened only to
allow incidental drainage activities that do not pose a
threat or risk to the disposal point system. The valve
shall be closed immediately after drainage activities
are completed.
(6) Traffic pathways that surround fueling
pads are considered high-use/high-risk areas and will
require a valve on the storm drainage system. Valves
installed on storm drainage systems shall be installed
downstream of all applicable private stormwater
quality facilities to accommodate spill containment.
These valves shall be left open to facilitate stormwater
flows during normal conditions, and immediately
closed in the event of a spill.
(C) Per the discretion of the City Engineer, the
city reserves the right to require existing fuel
dispensing facilities, not undergoing redevelopment
activities, to install pollution control measures as
described in this chapter if it is determined that such
facilities present an imminent risk to public health and
safety or cause or contribute to a water quality
violation in a Water of the State within or downstream
of the city’s jurisdiction.
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.052 MAINTENANCE OF PRIVATE
STORM WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.
(A) All storm water management facilities shall
be designed to:
(1) Minimize the need of maintenance; and
(2) Provide access for maintenance
purposes.
(B) The owner of any private drainage system
shall maintain the site to prevent discharge of
pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system or a
Water of the State. This maintenance shall include,
but is not limited to, sediment removal, bank erosion
repairs, maintenance of vegetative covers, and

QUANTITIES.
(A) All runoff generated on a project site shall
be subject to the controlled release rate provisions as
described in this section. Runoff from adjoining
property that flows through the project site must also
be addressed. Runoff for developed conditions shall
be calculated under the assumption that the tributary
drainage area is in its ultimate, fully developed
condition.
(B) All drainage calculations included in a
Drainage Permit application shall be prepared using
one of the following methods:
(1) Hydrologic Engineering Centers River
Analysis System (HECRAS);

§ 54.062 STORM SEWER PIPE MATERIALS.
Acceptable pipe materials include RCP, PVC and
HDPE. Class and strength of pipe materials shall
depend on depth of cover and shall be subject to the
City Engineer’s approval.
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.063 DITCH/SWALE DESIGN
STANDARDS.
(A) Material. Materials acceptable for use as
channel lining are grass, revetment riprap, concrete,
pre-cast cement concrete riprap, grouted riprap, and
gabions.
(B) Manning Equation. Ditch/swale design shall
be based on the Manning Equation.
(C) Minimum size. The required channel
cross-section and grade are determined by the design
capacity, the material in which the channel is to be
constructed, and the requirements for maintenance. A
minimum depth may be required to provide adequate
outlets for subsurface drains, tributary ditches or
streams. The channel grade shall be such that the
velocity in the channel is high enough to prevent
siltation but low enough to prevent erosion. Velocities
less than one and one-half feet per second shall be
avoided because siltation will take place and ultimately
reduce the channel cross-section. Developments
through which the channel is to be constructed must
be considered in design of the channel section.
(D) Side slopes. Side slopes for grass-lined
channels shall be no steeper than three to one. Side
slopes for rock riprap-lined channels shall be no
steeper than two to one. Channels with vertical walls
or with gabions may be constructed, with approval of
the City Engineer.
(E) Drainage of vegetated waterways.
Vegetated waterways that have less than 1% slope, are
subject to low flows of long duration, or where wet
conditions prevail shall be drained with an
underdrain or low flow structure. Lines may be
outletted through a drop structure at the end of the
waterway or through a standard tile outlet.
(F) Effects of channel improvements. Culverts
and bridges which are modified or added as part of
channel improvement projects shall be approved by
the City Engineer, and have a minimum capacity
based on storm frequencies as per Table 5-1
(§ 54.061).
(G) Disposition of spoil. Spoil material resulting
from clearing, grubbing and channel excavation shall
be removed from the site unless it is to be used as part
of the approved grading plan. In no case shall spoil be
deposited in a floodway. Excavated materials, when
stored temporarily on-site, must be handled in
accordance with this chapter and all applicable rules
and regulations.

and release stored runoff in accordance with the
specifications detailed in Table 5-1 (§ 54.061).
2006 S-3
Storm Water Drainage 113
(B) The City Engineer may waive requirements
for storm water detention for development properties
that are adjacent to and have direct discharge to White
River, Little Killibuck Creek or Killbuck Creek, with
supported calculations indicating no onsite flooding.
However, such developments shall submit to the City
Engineer approvable designs for: (1) erosion control
of outfalls; and (2) structural and nonstructural Best
Management Practices (BMP’s). Consideration shall
be made to the potential impacts on the Water Quality
of the receiving stream.
(C) The following criteria shall direct the design
of all storm water detention systems:
(1) Acceptable storage methods. Increased
rates and volumes of storm water runoff resulting
from a proposed development shall be detained on-site
through the use of an appropriate storm water
detention system. When a storm water detention
system is utilized to comply with city drainage
requirements, retention of storm water shall not be
allowed to occur within any swales, ditches, streams,
creeks and other drainage ways.
(2) Allowable release rate.
(a) The allowable release rate of storm
water discharging from a proposed development shall
not exceed the pre-development storm water release
rate for a storm event of a specified frequency. The
allowable release rates to the municipal storm sewer
system or a Water of the State are specified in Table
5-1 (§ 54.061).
(b) In the event the downstream storm
sewer or receiving stream is inadequate to
accommodate the release rate specified in Table 5-1
(§ 54.061), the allowable release rate shall be reduced
to a rate determined by the capacity of the receiving
downstream channel or storm sewer system, and
additional storage volume, to be determined by the
City Engineer, shall be required to store that portion
of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving
sewers or waterways.
(c) Drainage system emergency
overflow or spillway design. Drainage overflow or
spillway systems shall have adequate capacity to
convey the storm water runoff from all upstream
tributary areas through the development for a storm
with a statistically based 100-year return period based
on the post development condition of the upstream
tributary land area.
(D) Detention system specifications and
configurations.
(1) Outlet control structures shall be
designed to operate as simply as possible and shall
require little or no maintenance or attention for proper
operation. The structures should be designed to allow
easy access from the embankment to remove trash and
debris from the outlet structure.
(2) The overflow facility shall be of such
design that its operation is automatic and does not
require manual attention.
(3) Grass or other vegetative cover
approved by the City Engineer shall be planted
throughout the entire detention basin area.
(4) Debris and trash removal and other
necessary maintenance shall be performed regularly
by the designated body (e.g., owner, developer or
homeowner’s association) to insure continued
operation in conformance with the design
specifications.
(5) All storm water detention facilities shall
be located in a drainage/utility easement.
(6) Dry bottom detention facilities must
include an underdrain to drain the bottom of the storm
water detention facility. In addition, the bottom of the
facility shall be designed to have a longitudinal slope
of 1% and traverse grade to the outlet, so the facility
will empty, leaving no ponded water.
(7) Outlets shall include properly designed
grates to keep trash and debris out of the drainage
system.

Indiana Handbook For Erosion Control In Developing
Areas and the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide.
(Ord. 6-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 54.091 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
(A) All individuals who cause, in whole or in
part, any land alteration to occur shall provide soil
erosion and sedimentation control so as to adequately
prevent soils from being eroded and discharged or
deposited into adjacent properties or into a storm
water drainage system, a public street or right-of-way,
floodplain, body of water or watercourse.
(B) During any land alteration, which exposes
soil to an increased risk of erosion or sediment
track-out, the property owner and other individuals
causing or participating in the land alteration activity
shall do the following:
(1) Comply with provisions of this chapter,
and the requirements of all applicable county, state
and federal rules and regulations;
(2) Prevent damage to any public utilities or
services within the limits of grading and within any
routes of travel or areas of work of construction
equipment;
2006 S-3
116 Anderson - Public Works
(3) Prevent damage to or impairment of any
receiving water on or near the location of the land
alteration or affected thereby;
(4) Prevent damage to adjacent or nearby
land;
(5) Apply for all required approvals or
permits prior to the commencement of work;
(6) Proceed with the proposed work only in
accordance with approved plans and permits in
compliance with this chapter;
(7) Maintain all required soil erosion and
sedimentation control measures, including but not
limited to, measures required for compliance with the
terms of this chapter;
(8) Promptly remove all soil, sediment,
debris or other materials applied, dumped, tracked, or
otherwise deposited on any lands, public streets,
sidewalks, or other public ways or facilities, including
catch basins, storm sewers, ditches, drainage swales,
or water bodies. Removal of all such soil, sediment,
debris or other materials within 24 hours shall be
considered to be in compliance with this requirement,
unless such materials present an immediate hazard to
public health and safety; and
(9) Developers shall not conduct any land
alteration activities at locations adjacent to any of the
following: public streets, sidewalks, alleys, or other
public or private property without providing adequate
support or other measures so as to protect such
adjacent properties.
(C) Sediment control measures must be properly
installed by the developer before construction activity
begins. Control measures may be adjusted during dry
weather to accommodate short-term activities, such as
activities that require the passage of large vehicles or
equipment.
(D) Sedimentation basins must have a minimum
surface area equal to at least 1% of the area draining
to basin, and be constructed in accordance with
accepted design specifications including access for
assessment and maintenance. Basin discharge rates
must also be controlled to prevent erosion in the
discharge channel.
(E) The applicant shall install erosion and
sediment controls at locations directed or per final
approval by the City Engineer. Minimum
requirements include silt fences, rock check dams, or
other equivalent control measures along slopes. Silt
fences are required along channel edges to reduce the
potential of sediment introduction into any water
channel. Silt fences, rock check dams, etc. must be
regularly inspected and maintained.
(F) Sufficient silt fence shall be required to
intercept all overland flow runoff generated at an
individual site, until it can either infiltrate or seep
through the silt fence pores.
(G) Dewatering control measures shall discharge
into an appropriate sized and designed sediment trap
or pond.
(H) All temporary and permanent erosion and
sediment control BMP’s shall be maintained in a
manner to insure continued performance of their
intended function. The owner/developer shall be
responsible for insuring that any erosion and sediment
control measures damaged during floods or other
adverse weather conditions are returned to normal
operating condition as soon as possible.
(I) Removal of temporary BMP’s. All
temporary erosion and sediment control BMP’s shall
be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization
is achieved. The removal of temporary erosion and
sediment control BMP’s may not be required for those
projects, such as single-family plats, that will be
followed by additional construction under a different
permit. In these circumstances, the need for removing
or retaining the measures will be evaluated on a
site-specific basis by the City Engineer.
(J) Changes in site topography. The maximum
surface gradient on any artificially created slope shall
2006 S-3
Storm Water Drainage 117
be two feet of horizontal run to one of vertical fall
(2:1). This gradient may be increased if it can be
demonstrated through engineering calculations to be
stable.
(K) At all times, the contractor shall have
sufficient materials, equipment and labor on-site to
stabilize and prevent erosion from all denuded areas
within 12 hours as site and weather conditions dictate.
(L) Water removed from the site by pumping
must be treated by temporary sedimentation basins,
geotextile filters, grit chambers, sand filters, up-flow
chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or
other appropriate controls. Such water shall not be
discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding
of the site, receiving channels, adjacent property or a
wetland.
(M) All erosion and sediment control BMP’s
shall be constructed and functional before any land
alteration activities occur.
(N) Cut and fill slopes shall be constructed in a
manner that will minimize erosion.
(O) Whenever construction vehicle access routes
intersect paved roads, provisions must be made to
minimize the transport of sediment onto the paved
road by use of appropriate BMP’s such as a stabilized
construction entrance. At a minimum, temporary rock
construction entrances shall be required whenever
vehicles enter and exit a site. If sediment is
transported onto a road surface, the road shall be
thoroughly cleaned. Sediment shall be removed from
roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to
a sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be
allowed only after sediment is removed in this
manner.
(P) For soil stockpiles, the toe of the pile must
be more than 25 feet from all roads, drainage channels
or storm water inlets. If such stockpiles will be left for
more than 14 days, they must be stabilized with
mulch, vegetation or suitable covers. If left for less
than 14 days, erosion from stockpiles must be
controlled with silt fences or rock check dams.
(Q) If for any reason a soil stockpile of any size
is located closer than 25 feet from a road, drainage
channel or storm sewer inlet, and will be left for more
than seven days, it must be stabilized with mulch,
vegetation, or suitable covers.
(R) All storm drain inlets made operable during
construction shall be protected so storm water runoff
shall not enter the conveyance system without first
being filtered or otherwise treated with silt fence or an
equivalent barrier designed to remove sediment.
(S) All temporary on-site conveyance channels
shall be designed, constructed and stabilized to
prevent erosion from the expected flow velocity from
a two-year frequency, 24-hour duration storm for the
post-development condition. Stabilization adequate to
prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks,
slopes and downstream reaches shall be provided at
the outlets of all conveyance systems.
(T) The City Engineer or designated
representative has the authority to inspect all
construction activities to ensure that owners/
developers comply with this chapter and all applicable
county, state and federal regulations.
(U) During construction, the individual or firm
responsible for the site development is responsible for
maintenance of erosion and sedimentation control
devices in compliance with this chapter.

contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse.
(B) The property owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent
to a watercourse, so that such structures will not
become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. The owner or lessee shall
not remove healthy vegetation beyond that actually
necessary for maintenance, nor remove said
vegetation in such a manner as to increase the
vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The
property owner shall be responsible for maintaining
and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is
within their property lines in order to protect against
erosion and degradation of the watercourse originating
or contributed from the property.
(C) (1) Easements intended for periodic or
occasional use to convey the flow of surface water
runoff shall be maintained in an unobstructed
condition by the owners of the properties they cross.
When specified as a restrictive covenant, the City
Engineer shall have the right to determine if any
obstruction exists and to repair and maintain, or
require such repair and maintenance by the property
owner if the owner is deemed responsible for the
obstruction, as shall be necessary to maintain proper
operation of the drain.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any individual to
stop, fill, dam, confine, pave, alter the course of, or
otherwise interfere with any natural or constructed
drain, or drainage way without first submitting a
drainage plan to the city in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(D) No filling, blocking, fencing or planting of
vegetation shall take place within a floodway without
obtaining all required permits from all agencies with
jurisdiction over such activity.

weight as to prevent the animal from moving about
freely. It shall be unlawful to tether any un-sterilized
dog for any period of time unless it is monitored by a
competent adult for the duration of such tethering; or
to tether or confine an animal at a vacant structure or

Dog must have access to dry land, cannot be standing
in water or his/her own waste. Your dog must be
brought inside a temperature controlled building such
as your house or garage when there is a wind-chill

addition the shelter must be shaded by either trees or
a tarp. Each situation is at the discretion of
investigating officer or official to determine if an
animal is in distress or in danger. Twenty degrees (20
degrees) may not be an issue for a Husky or dog with
an undercoat but may be a life or death situation for a
different type dog such as a Yorkie. The dog must
have access to shelter at all times. The suggested
temperatures to bring dog in is 20 degrees and 90
degrees.
(b) You may not allow your dog to

tied out.
(c) Dogs residing in kennels must be
provided with adequate space for exercise. (They
should be able to move, run and lie down without
running into another animal for lack of space.) The
suggested sq. footage for kennel is 100 square feet,
for dogs weighing more than 80 pounds, the kennel
must be 150 square feet. For each additional dog an
additional 50 square feet must be provided. There
must be adequate shelter in the kennels and must have
other than the shelter (house) shade or a tarp. No
animals may be kept in abandoned houses or in
abandoned lots.
(2) Provided with the reasonably necessary
medical care, which shall include recommended

vaccination as required by accepted veterinary
standards, and if diseased or injured, or exhibiting
symptoms of disease, receives proper care and is
segregated from other animals so as to prevent
transmittal of disease.
(3) Not left unattended in a vehicle when
the conditions in that vehicle would constitute a health
hazard to the animal (extreme heat or cold); and is not
transported in the trunk of any vehicle.
(E) A person who uses an animal in a fighting
contest violates this chapter.
(F) An animal that is mistreated in violation of
divisions (A), (B), (D) or (E)may be taken by the
police or humane officers and impounded in the city
animal care and control, and there confined in a
humane manner.
(G) If court action is not commenced by the city
against the person who has mistreated an animal in
violation of the foregoing divisions within ten days
after impoundment, the animal may be released back
to the animal’s rightful owner; provided, however,
that the owner first pays all expenses incurred by the
animal care and control during the period of the
animal’s impoundment, including any and all medical
expenses incurred by the animal care and control in
treating and/or caring for the animal and/or in having
the animal spayed or neutered if the animal was
brought to the facility unaltered and the owner of such
animal does not meet one of the exceptions contained
in § 91.71, as well as all fines, penalties or fees that
may be assessed in accordance with § 91.51 or any
other section of this chapter.
(H) If court action is commenced by the city
within ten days after impoundment, the animal may
not be released without court authorization.
(I) If the court determines that a violation of the
foregoing divisions on mistreatment has occurred, the
animal that was mistreated shall become property of
the local government authority, and shall be placed for
adoption in a suitable home or humanely euthanized.

BE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
Any vehicle parked or left standing unattended
upon any street or public place in the city in violation
of any of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances or

(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.06 POWERS AND DUTIES OF SAFETY
BOARD.
(A) Scope. The provisions of this section shall
apply only in the case of involuntary tows, meaning
situations where a vehicle is towed by a towing
service selected by the city without input from the
owner or person lawfully in possession of the vehicle.
Such situations include times when the owner is
injured and unable to select a towing service, when
public safety demands that a towing service be called
before an owner is available, or when no owner or
user of the automobile is present or reachable.
(B) Exclusions. These provisions are in no way
intended to impair the ability of a vehicle owner to
select the towing service of the owner’s choice when
the owner is present and able to express that choice.
Likewise, nothing in this section may control the
prices charged by towing services contracting
2007 S-4
Abandoned Vehicles 31
privately with individuals or others for towing and
related services without participation by the city. Also
outside the scope of these provisions are situations
where the city is the recipient and payor for towing
services, such as when vehicles are towed for
evidentiary purposes in the course of criminal
investigations, or when city vehicles are disabled.
Towing services may be purchased by the city in the
same manner in which the city purchases other
services.
(C) The Board of Public Safety is empowered to
create written minimum standards for private towing
companies who wish to perform involuntary tows
initiated by the city. Such standards may include hours
of operation, experience, equipment requirements,
insurance coverage, financial security, security
measures for stored vehicles, or other qualifications.
(D) The Board of Public Safety is further
empowered to select a single company to perform all
involuntary tows initiated by the city. Such selection
may take place by publicly soliciting either bids or
proposals from eligible towing services, in the
manners described in I.C. 5-22.
(E) In the selection process, the city must make
available written eligibility standards, specifications
for towing services, as well as the criteria by which
the winning towing service will be selected. Such
eligibility standards shall require the towing service to
maintain a lot in an I-2 zone class district within the
city and obtain a special exception for the operation of
a junk yard.
(F) The Board of Public Safety may enter into
an agreement with the selected towing service for up
to a two-year period as the exclusive provider of
involuntary tows. Such agreement shall be expressly
conditioned upon the selected towing service
performing all services adequately.
(G) The Board of Public Safety shall provide a
complaint process for citizens to raise any concerns
with the performance of towing services discussed
herein.
(Ord. 90-06, passed 1-11-07)
§ 92.07 PROCEDURES FOR REMOVING AND
IMPOUNDING VEHICLES.
(A) Vehicles involved in an accident may be
towed by any wrecker of the owner’s or operator’s
choosing, provided that such wrecker is summoned
promptly to avoid creating a traffic hazard. If the
officer on the scene of the accident determines a
traffic hazard has been created by delay in the arrival
of the owner’s or operator’s chosen wrecker, or if the
owner or operator does not care to select a wrecker of
his own choice, the officer may declare the vehicle a
traffic hazard, and it shall become subject to the
officer’s order to a contract towing service as
provided in § 92.06 to remove it from the scene.
However, the vehicle shall not be subject to
impoundment, but shall be towed to the destination
selected by the owner or operator. If the owner or
operator is under a disability by reason of injury or
arrest, the vehicle shall be subject to impoundment
upon order of the officer on the scene. If the owner or
operator does not select a destination, the officer shall
direct that the vehicle be towed to a contract towing
service lot as provided in § 92.06.
(B) Vehicles recovered as stolen or which come
into the custody of the Police Department for other
reasons, or are abandoned as defined in this chapter,
shall be subject to impoundment upon order of the
officer having control of the vehicle.
(C) All other vehicles subject to removal by the
city may be towed by a contract towing service upon
notification and order by an officer, and may be
impounded and stored pursuant to provisions of
§ 92.04.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.08 COMMUNICATIONS.
The Chief of Police may authorize in writing a
contract towing service to install police frequency
monitor radios in its trucks for use in response to
2007 S-4
32 Anderson - General Regulations
accident scenes and the locations of improperly parked
vehicles. A contract towing service tow truck may
only use such a radio to respond to direct orders from
the central police dispatcher.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.09 UNAUTHORIZED WRECKER AT
SCENE.
(A) It shall be unlawful for any wrecker to
proceed to the scene of an accident for solicitation
purposes without having been summoned by either the
party involved in the accident or an officer at the
scene of the accident. Such unauthorized response is
declared a traffic hazard and harmful to the health,
welfare, and safety of the people of the city; as such,
those wreckers so responding are declared public
nuisances and subject to impoundment procedures,
upon order of the officer at the scene of the accident.
(B) It shall be unlawful for any wrecker to
monitor for solicitation purposes, city police
frequency radios installed in tow trucks without
having written authorization for a police monitor
installation by the Chief of Police.
(C) A person violating any provision of this
section shall be fined not more than $500.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.10 LIABILITY OF CITY AND WRECKER.
The city shall not be liable for any loss or
damage which may occur to any vehicle which is
removed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. A
contract towing service as a condition to participation
in the rotating wrecker service system shall indemnify
and hold harmless the city, its officers, agents and
employees, from any loss, claim, judgment, or
damages arising from the removal and storage of
vehicles pursuant to this chapter. A contract towing
service shall have sole responsibility for any articles
of personal property which may be contained in any
vehicle at the time of its removal.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.11 RESPONSIBILITY OF WRECKER AT
ACCIDENT SITE.
A wrecker directed by an officer or the police
dispatcher to remove vehicles from the scene of an
accident shall clean the street or accident location of
all debris caused by the accident.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.12 DESIGNATION OF VEHICLE.
The officer requesting the impoundment of a
vehicle shall designate the vehicle as an abandoned
vehicle if it is being impounded as such.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.13 VEHICLES UNCLAIMED AFTER
FIFTEEN DAYS; PROCEDURE.
The Police Department shall maintain a record of
vehicles towed and released. If any vehicle remains
unclaimed after fifteen days from the date of towing,
it shall be the responsibility of the contracting tow
service to so notify the Police Department of such
fact. Upon such further investigation and
determination as the Department shall deem
appropriate, the Department or the towing service
shall through its designated officer, prepare, execute
and forward to the State Bureau of Motor Vehicles the
appropriate abandoned vehicle report. In any instance
in which a vehicle is towed as abandoned pursuant to
I.C. 9-22-1-16 or becomes abandoned by virtue of
being unclaimed for 15 days, the Police Department
shall follow the procedures outlined in I.C. 9-22-1-22.
(Ord. 41-88, passed 8-22-88)
§ 92.14 DISPOSITION OF ABANDONED
VEHICLES.
(A) This section pertains only to the disposition
of abandoned motor vehicles found upon public
places, vehicles abandoned upon private property or
in the possession of persons other than the person who
owns the vehicle and the person cannot establish the
right to possession of the vehicle, as provided within
I.C. 9-22-1, et seq.
2007 S-4
Abandoned Vehicles 32A
(B) The market value below which a law
enforcement officer may dispose of a vehicle or parts
under the provisions of I.C. 9-22-1-13(a) is now
established to be $500.
(C) An abandoned vehicle having a value
under$500 shall not be required to be tagged for 72
hours as otherwise required by state law, but may be
immediately disposed of to an automobile scrapyard,
all in accordance with I.C. 9-22-1-13(a). The law
enforcement officer shall proceed thereafter in
accordance with all other provisions of state law
pertaining to abandoned vehicles.

§ 99.27 PERMISSION TO PLANT.
(A) No person shall plant, treat, spray or prune
a street tree or hire a certified arborist to care for a
street tree unless the Tree Commission and/or Urban
Forester first grants a proper permit. Said permits
may be issued to property owners or to certified
arborists. The purpose of this permit is to insure the
planting of desirable trees and the proper spacing
along the streets.

the Tree Commission and/or Urban Forester, or
Urban Forestry Representative, has granted a proper
permit. Said permits may be issued only to certified
arborists.

person to plant any trees, shrubs, or any other plants
on any public right-of-way or municipal property until
a permit has been obtained from the Tree Commission
and/or Urban Forestry Representative. The purpose
of this restriction is to reduce overhead line clearance
2010 S-7
100 Anderson - General Regulations
and tree removal costs, and lessen potential highway
hazards by reducing the interference with street
lighting and the danger of falling limbs and trees. The
Commission is authorized to refuse the granting of a
permit when the planting is likely to create a public
danger or nuisance or to be detrimental to the growth
of adjacent trees.
(B) The Commission may remove, prune, or
cause to be removed or pruned, all trees, shrubs, or
plants that are planted on the public right-of-way or
municipal property, when it is determined the pruning
or removal will be beneficial to the peace, health, and
safety of the public and public improvements or where
trees, shrubs, or plants are detrimental to the growth
of adjacent trees.
(C) Any tree removed from the public
right-of-way or municipal property must be cut flush
with the ground, unless the stump is to be removed
then refer to § 99.38. No brush, limbs or other parts
of a removed tree shall be allowed to remain on any
city street overnight.

No street trees may be planted under or within 20
horizontal feet of any overhead utility line, or within
five horizontal feet of any underground water line,
sewer line, transmission line or other utility line.
Shrubs growing no more than ten feet high are
acceptable under utility lines, if they do not otherwise
create a hazard. No street tree may be planted in a
position to block the direct path of light from a street
light to roadway or sidewalk surfaces. Any tree that
grows to block the direct path of light from a street
light to the roadway or sidewalk may be removed by
the city or a public utility as prescribed in
§ 99.30(C)(4).

see § 99.99
§ 99.30 ROUTINE TREE CARE.
(A) Rights and responsibilities of the city/public
utilities.
(1) The city shall have the right to plant,
prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs
within the boundaries of dedicated rights-of-way,
alleys, avenues, lanes, squares and park grounds, or
other areas maintained as public rights-of-way as may
be necessary to insure public safety or to preserve or
enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public
grounds. See Appendix B for Tree Care Standards for
Public Land Trees.
(2) A utility may remove or cause to be
removed any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe
condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious
to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water lines,
or other public improvements, or which is affected
with any injurious fungus, insect or other pest, or
which otherwise poses an identifiable threat to public
safety. Except in emergency situations,
communications or electric utilities will notify the
Tree Commission and/or Urban Forestry
Representative before removing any tree.
(3) Public utilities may trim or remove
trees, tree roots and branches as necessary for the
maintenance of utility service and as is prescribed by
state law and limited in division (C)(4) below. The
cost of such tree care on private property is not the
responsibility of the city.
(4) Within the limits of this chapter and the
Tree Commission’s budget, the city shall assume the
expense of tree care for street trees. All routine street
tree care undertaken by the city shall be initiated by
the Tree Commission and undertaken by a certified
and/or trained arborist according to standards listed in
Appendix B.
(B) Rights and responsibilities of property
owners.
2010 S-7
Trees 101
(1) All property owners shall be responsible
for having all trees, shrubs, vines or other plants
growing under or near the utility lines on their
property trimmed or pruned, so as to prevent them
from growing under, near or over utility lines within
a horizontal distance of 20 feet from such lines. In the
event that the property owner fails to trim or prune the
trees, shrubs, vines and other plants, the utility shall
have full authority to trim or prune the trees within a
horizontal distance of 20 feet from such lines. The
applicable utility must be contacted by the property
owner before trimming or removing any trees, shrubs,
vines or other vegetation growing in or near utility
lines on private property, so that electric or other
utility service may be shut off as needed. Trimming
and removal techniques of trees shall follow standards
stated in Appendix B. Division (A)(4) above shall
apply for street trees growing under/into power lines.
(2) The property owner shall share with the
city the responsibility of proper routine care, as stated
in Appendix B and § 99.32, of street trees in the street
rights-of-way. This area will include the distance,
recorded on the city plat maps, including the curb and
the sidewalk plus any remaining footage to equal the
established right-of-way for a specific address. This
responsibility includes monitoring tree health and
notifying the Urban Forester or Urban Forestry
Representative/city when street/right-of-way trees
have major maintenance needs.
(3) This section does not prohibit the
planting of street trees by adjacent property owners
provided that the selection, location and installation of
said trees are in accordance with Appendices A, B, C
and §§ 99.25 through 99.29.
(C) Tree care standards of general applicability.
(1) In general it will be more satisfactory to
engage an arborist or someone familiar with tree care
to do any planting. If the property owner does the
planting, he or she should familiarize himself or
herself with the requirements for proper selection,
placement, and transplanting of trees. See Appendix
C for the city Planting Standards for Public Areas.
(2) All materials to be planted should be
nursery stock.
(3) Proper watering is extremely important
for trees the first two years following transplanting.
During dry periods, add enough water to soak the soil
to root depth once a week. Transplanted trees can be
overwatered. If the soil is heavy and drains poorly,
the trees may be injured by too much water as well as
too little.
(4) Unless approved in advance by the
city’s Tree Commission and/or Urban Forestry
Representative(s) for good cause shown, it shall be
unlawful for any person to top (see § 99.32) trees
within a city right-of-way or on other city property,
including doing any of the following:
(a) Prune horizontally a branch of
more than one inch in diameter; or
(b) Cut limbs within a tree’s canopy
back to stubs.

(A) No person shall prune, cut, molest, break,
deface, repair, or do surgery on any tree or part
thereof, or in any manner interfere with, disturb, or
injure any tree, shrub, or plant on a public
right-of-way or municipal property, nor shall any
person permit any hazardous chemical, either solid or
fluid to seep, drain, or be emptied on or about any
tree, shrub, or plant that is now or hereafter, growing
on a public right-of-way or municipal property.
(B) No person shall fasten to a tree or shrub, for
the purpose of anchorage, any wire, rope, chain, or
cable. No person shall nail, tie, or in any other
manner fasten any cords, signs, posters, boards, or
any other particle to any tree, shrub, or plant that is
now or may hereafter be growing on a public
right-of-way or municipal property.

(4) Which obstructs or endangers passing
vehicles and pedestrians.
(B) If a tree constitutes a hazard to life and
property, or harbors insects or disease which
constitutes a potential threat to other trees, the city
shall have the right to cause the removal of such dead
or diseased trees on private property within the city.
The Tree Commission will notify in writing the
owners of such trees, removal shall be done by said
owners at their own expense within 60 days after the
date of service of notice. In the event of failure of
owner to comply with such provisions, the city shall

§ 99.39 REMOVAL OF TREES INTERFERING
WITH POWER LINES ON PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
(A) Trees sometimes create unreasonably
hazardous conditions for electrical supply lines by
growing near, into or around these lines. Such a
condition may create risks of fire, personal injury,
property damage, or interruption of the electrical
supply to neighboring homes or businesses. In the
event that a tree creates a hazard by virtue of its
position or proximity in relation to power lines on
private property, the situation may be fixed by:
(1) The owner having the tree(s) pruned
back to a safe distance from power lines, at the
owner’s expense;
(2) Rerouting or burying the power lines,
at the owner’s expense; or
(3) For persons unable to afford trimming,
rerouting or burying, the utility may remove a tree
entirely. In this situation, the utility may at its option
bury electrical supply lines, but only if burying is
more cost-effective than removing the tree entirely.
Burying the lines may only be done if the property
owner converts the property’s electrical system to
receive an underground electrical supply, at the
owner’s expense.
(B) Until the situation is fixed to remedy the
unsafe condition, the utility may be unable to supply
electricity. It remains the responsibility of property
owners to monitor tree growth on their property and
maintain trees in a safe manner.

APPENDIX B: TREE CARE STANDARDS FOR CITY TREES
(A) Trees pruning terminology - standard pruning.
(1) Coarse pruning. (See Figure B-1) removal of dead wood greater than two inches diameter and any
hazardous branches.
(2) Medium pruning. (See Figure B-2) includes coarse pruning, plus removal of dead wood greater
than one inch diameter and specialty treatments (raising branch height, site clearance, crossing or broken
branches, thinning canopy).
(3) Fine pruning. (See Figure B-3) includes medium pruning, plus removal of all dead wood and any
water sprouts, suckers and crossing branches; inspection for health conditions. Climber should inspect to the tip
of every branch. Up to 15% of canopy may be removed for light and air penetration.
2010 S-7
104L Anderson - General Regulations
(4) Raising branches. Removal of lowest branches to a prescribed height for appropriate clearance
needs. Generally eight feet over sidewalks, 14 feet over streets and a variety of heights for mower clearance (only
if needed).
(B) Pruning trees- natural target pruning. The practice of natural target pruning makes use of the branch
collar to identify the proper location to remove a branch. But there is a three-cut process that must be used to
remove branches in order to preserve the bark tissue and the branch collar. See Figures B-4 and B-5.
(1) The first cut (marked A in figures below) is an undercut about one-fourth through the branch made
upward from the bottom of the branch about one or two inches farther out than the collar.
(2) The second cut (marked B in figures below) is a downward cut just outside the undercut that
actually removes the entire branch, eliminating the weight of the branch before making the final natural target
cut.
(3) The third cut (marked C-D in figures below) is the natural target cut. The remaining portion of the
stub is removed with a cut made just outside of the branch collar tissue.
(4) The American National Standard for tree pruning is ANSI A300. The American National Standards
Institute approved its development process. This pruning standard should be followed where possible in all
pruning situations to remain consistent with industry standards. Please note that the A300 standard has been
2010 S-7
Trees 104M
drafted to address pruning specifications across all geographic areas. Knowledge of the growth habits of certain
tree species within a given environment may alter how the recommendations of A300 are interpreted.
PRUNING TYPES:
A300 provides two basic objectives.
Hazard Reduction Pruning (HRP) is recommended when the primary objective is to reduce the danger to
a specific target caused by visibly defined hazards in a tree. For example, HRP may be the primary objective
if a tree had many dead limbs over a park bench.
Maintenance Pruning (MP) is recommended when the primary objective is to maintain or improve tree
health and structure, and includes hazard reduction pruning. An example here might be to perform a MP
operation on a front yard tree.
HRP and MP should consist of one or more of the pruning types noted below.
Crown Cleaning shall consist of the selective removal of one or more of the following items: dead, dying
or diseased branches, weak branches and watersprouts.
Crown Thinning shall consist of the selective removal of branches of increase light penetration, air
movement and reduce weight.
Crown Raising shall consist of the removal of the lower branches of a tree to provide clearance.
Crown Reduction, or Crown Shaping decreases the height and/or spread of a tree. Consideration should
be given to the ability.
Vista Pruning is selective thinning of framework limbs or specific areas of the crown to allow a view of an
object from a
Crown Restoration should improve the structure, form and appearance of trees that have been severely
headed, vandalized,
PRUNING SPECIFICATIONS:
Some deviations in these specifications may occur for specific site conditions/situations. Please contact the Tree
Commission and/or Urban Forestry Representative for approval.
All trees (protecting the branch collar): Crown cleaning limbs to a minimum of one and one-half inches;
Vertical clearance of 14 feet over streets and eight feet over sidewalks; reduce end weight by removal of
limbs less than two to three inches at the end of scaffolds;
2010 S-7
104N Anderson - General Regulations
Tie back branches to provide temporary clearance;
Do not prune if boring insects are flying (they are attracted to fresh wounds);
All pruning shall be performed by qualified arborist (ISA Certified Arborist or Tree Worker);
All pruning shall follow ISA’s Tree Pruning Guidelines or most recent ANSI A300 Pruning Standards, and
ANSI Z133.1 Safety Standards;
Some interior branches shall remain;
No live wood greater than four inches in diameter shall be cut;
Heartwood shall not be exposed if possible;
A maximum of 20% of live wood shall be removed;
The arborist shall identify defects by performing aerial inspection and report to supervisor; and
Chipped brush shall be spread on the root zone to a maximum of six inches, but the trunk shall be clear of
mulch.
GENERAL INFORMATION:
Although topping trees is a common practice in many communities, it is not a professional method for pruning
trees. It is not a practice that should be performed by any certified arborist because there are professional pruning
techniques to limit the height of a tree.
Topping practices do not follow the rules of pruning that protect the branch collars or that stipulate size limits for
pruning to lateral branches, thus they are not made in a professional manner and leave stubs of branches in the
canopy. These stubs are not protected from decay organisms, and open the tree to invasion by insects and decay.
This decay can penetrate to the lower branches and trunk of the tree and cause its rapid decline and possibly
death. These problems are shown in Figure 7-3.
Topping, or “rounding over” is mistakenly believed to control the height of a tree. However, the new stems will
soon grow to be the same height as the tree is genetically programmed to be. But the new stems will be numerous
and crowded and weakly attached at the point of topping. Many of these will die back and fall off during windy
weather.

APPENDIX C: PLANTING STANDARDS FOR CITY TREES AND SHRUBS
Accepted tree planting techniques.
(A) The hole should be no deeper than the root ball.
(B) The hole should be three to four times wider than the root ball.
(C) Mulch should cover the entire planting hole, but not be piled onto the trunk of the tree.
(D) Contrary to popular belief, the burlap material should be removed because it may not dissolve below
ground. The best suggestion is to remove all of the burlap. But at the least the top third of the burlap should be
cut off to allow new roots to grow unobstructed. The biggest difference from previous planting diagrams is the
hole itself, that has the shape of a shallow basin.
(E) The hole is only as deep as the root ball. This provides a firm base that will keep the tree from settling
to submerge the trunk flare.
(F) The hole is three to four times wider than the root mass. This prepares a loosened and aerated soil in
the area that the new roots will grow.
(G) A small water retaining berm is placed at the edge of the hole to help hold irrigation water in the root
zone.
(H) The mulch is applied over the entire transplanting hole. This will help retain moisture in the root zone
and possibly protect the trunk from mower damage. The mulch is applied neither onto the trunk flare nor up onto
the trunk. Mulch on the trunk can allow the bark to decay and make the tree likely to become diseased or rot
through.
(I) The hole is only as deep as the root ball. This provides a firm base that will keep the tree from settling
to submerge the trunk flare.

104P Anderson - General Regulations
(J) Staking is not usually needed on small trees. If one believes stakes are needed, the stakes are placed well
outside the existing root mass, and the holding straps are fastened loosely to the trunk to let it partially sway in
the wind as it would naturally. This will let the roots develop strength needed to support the weight of the tree
against wind throw.
(K) Once planted, the tree should receive approximately ten gallons of water to start. Watering will continue
until the tree has fully established (one year for every inch caliper). Based on the standard that a new tree should
receive an inch of rain weekly, and if it doesn’t rain, one must irrigate to supply the difference. The irrigation
recommendation is to provide at least three to five gallons of water per week.
(L) Many people, including many landscape architects, landscape contractors and maintenance
professionals, discount the importance of the process and techniques of transplanting trees. The transplanting
process is critical to the successful establishment and future health of the tree.
(M) Unfortunately, lots of books have information and diagrams that are incorrect, outdated and contrary
to recent recommendations. Using these old procedures will eventually cause direct damage to the tree, or
jeopardize the health of the tree.
(N) The information presented here is based on the most recent research and recorded observations of
successful techniques. For example, recent studies about transplanting trees have indicated that smaller trees
transplant more easily and more successfully than larger diameter trees. They are lighter and easier to handle,
they are less likely to be dropped or damaged in transit and they are more likely to have adequate roots to support
their crown.
(O) Successful transplanting depends on three main factors:
(1) Root zone moisture level and watering, (see below);
(2) Planting depth in a proper hole; and
(3) Time of year for planting.
ROOT ZONE MOISTURE AND WATERING:
The root mass needs adequate moisture levels to supply the leaves and stems for turgor (rigidity). The
general rule applied here is that the tree should receive an inch of rain weekly, and if it doesn’t rain, one must
irrigate to supply the difference. At least three to five gallons of water is suggested. A common error that will
prevent successful establishment is to stop irrigating the tree too early in its development.
How long should one continue to watch the tree for wilting conditions? Arnold (1993) indicated that irrigation
may be needed for as long as three years after transplanting. (These time frames are for one and one-half inch
to two inch caliper (diameter) trees at planting). This amount of time is not the usual concern of most landscapers,
but one should inspect the condition of the root zone regularly and keep up the irrigation if one wants the tree to
survive. The report also indicated that more time will be needed for establishment if one is planting large (three
to four inches) caliper trees or if one is planting trees in northern latitudes.
2010 S-7
Trees 104Q
PROPER PLANTING DEPTH:
Planting depth is probably the most common error made when transplanting trees. Our experiences and
observations indicate that trees are frequently planted too deeply into the ground.
If one cannot see the trunk flare at purchase, excavate the top of the ball to expose it. This tree had been
planted too deeply at the nursery. The root mass is distinctly restricted and the trunk is subject to disease and
decay.
This may occur at the nursery during planting or the soil may build up because of cultivation practices. In
this case the trunk flare will not be visible at the surface of the root mass.
Be sure to excavate the soil to find the trunk flare before transplanting, otherwise the buried trunk may
develop suckers. This concern holds true for containerized trees as well.
If a tree has been planted too deeply, one may be able to see space around the trunk where it has ‘wiggled’
in the breeze. Remove the upper portion of the potting mix until the trunk flare is exposed.
A visible trunk flare is the proper level for the transplant depth.
TIME OF YEAR FOR PLANTING:
B&B trees can be transplanted in the fall, winter or spring because root growth occurs mainly in two
seasons, fall and early spring. The trees should be dormant because they have suffered severe (up to 85%) root
loss while being dug and wrapped in burlap. They will use energy stored in the trunk and roots to support new
root growth. If planting after winter, don’t wait too long because trees need adequate time to develop enough
roots to supply moisture to the spring growth of leaves and stems. When selecting these trees, be cautious if one
notices that fresh roots are growing out of the burlap. This indicates that the trees have been in storage for a long
time. Although new roots may exist within the ball, those roots outside the burlap will be destroyed when
removing the burlap to transplant the trees.
Containerized trees are becoming more popular in the nursery industry. They are easier to handle and store
than B&B trees because they weigh less and are not as prone to damage of the root mass. It is assumed that they
can be transplanted at any time of year because the root mass is extensive in the container and the roots will suffer
very little damage in transplanting. Although generally true, one still must give serious consideration to root zone
moisture during dry months because the plants are not dormant and leaves will be actively growing and losing
water through transpiration.
2010 S-7
104R Anderson - General Regulations
Containerized production usually uses an artificial mix without soil that can dry out rapidly. Be sure the root
mass has been thoroughly watered before transplanting and keep adequate moisture levels during establishment.
Bare-root trees will be available from late winter to early spring, and must be dormant during storage, transit
and transplanting. The roots may be misted in storage to prevent drying, or the roots may be bagged in plastic
or mesh bags with moist sawdust or wood chips to prevent drying. Be sure to shake or brush off as much sawdust
as possible before transplanting and do not mix the sawdust or wood chips into the hole. The sawdust or wood
chips can be added to any surface mulch one may use.

§ 102.05 INVESTIGATION.
(A) Whenever a local government designee has
reason to believe that a discharge of a hazardous
substance has occurred or is about to occur, the local
government designee may undertake such
investigation, monitoring, surveying, testing and other
information gathering as the local government
designee may deem necessary or appropriate to
identify the existence and extent of a discharge or the
threat of a discharge, the source and nature of any
hazardous substances involved and the extent of
danger to the public health or welfare or to the
environment.
(B) The local government designee may issue an
administrative subpoena, approved by the city’s
Department of Law and attested and filed in the office
of the City Clerk, requiring any person who has or
may have information relevant to any of the following
to furnish, upon reasonable notice, information or
documents relating to such matter:
(1) The identification, nature and quantity
of materials which have been or are manufactured,
generated, treated, stored or disposed of at the
property;

same manner as a subpoena issued pursuant to
I.C. 36-4-6-21.
(D) In addition, upon reasonable notice, such
person shall either:
(1) Grant the local government designee
access at all reasonable times to any vessel, facility,
establishment, place, property or location to inspect
and copy all documents or records relating to such
matters; or
(2) Copy and furnish to the local
government designee all such documents or records,
at the option and expense of such person. However,
nothing in this section shall be interpreted to waive the
local government designee’s ability to inspect original
documents.
(E) The local government designee is authorized
to enter at reasonable times any of the following:
(1) Any vessel, facility, establishment or
other place or property where any hazardous
substance may be or has been discharged;

§ 112.21 POLE LINES AND FACILITY
ARRANGEMENTS.
(A) The city and a grantee shall follow the
provisions of a general agreement regarding pole
attachment between a grantee and the City of
Anderson Department of Municipal Light and Power.
(B) A grantee shall, where an agreement can be
reached with the telephone company, the utility
company serving the city and all other holders of
public licenses and franchises within the corporate
limits of the city, utilize existing poles, towers or
other facilities of said holders wherever possible, and
it shall be the sole responsibility of a grantee to
negotiate and to enter into any and all contracts with
the owners of such facilities to secure the necessary
space thereof or therein for its operation under a
franchise agreement.
(C) Upon securing such agreement with such
other holders of public permits and franchises, a
grantee shall be granted the right to use such existing
poles, towers, and other facilities. Such use shall be
subject to all existing and future ordinances and
regulations of the city. All holders of public licenses
and franchises within the corporate limits of the city
shall cooperate with a grantee to allow grantee’s joint
use of their poles and pole line facilities wherever
possible or wherever such usage does not interfere
with the normal operation of said poles. Said
cooperation shall include the rights of joint usage at
reasonable rates and terms in accordance with
applicable law.
(D) To the extent that a grantee is unable to
contract with the owners and users of such existing
poles, towers and other facilities, it may erect such
poles, towers and other facilities which may be
required as may be necessary for the proper
construction and maintenance of the cable system
upon the filing of the plans and specifications for same
with the Board of Works and receiving the Board of
Works’ approval.
(E) A grantee shall grant to the city free of
expense, joint use of any and all poles owned by a
grantee for any proper municipal purpose insofar as
such may be done without interfering with the free use
and enjoyment of grantee’s own wires and fixtures,
and the city shall hold a grantee harmless from any
and all actions, causes of actions or damages caused
by the placing of city wires or appurtenances upon the
poles of a grantee. Where the city desires to make use
of the poles or other wire-holding structures of a
grantee, but agreement thereof with grantee cannot be
reached, the city may require grantee to permit such
use for such consideration and upon such terms as the
city shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the
city determines that the use would enhance the public
convenience and would not unduly interfere with the
grantee’s operations.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.22 SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION.
(A) Initial franchises - required documents and
construction schedule.
(1) Upon accepting an initial franchise, a
grantee shall within 60 days file the documents
required to obtain all necessary federal, state and local
licenses, permits and authorizations required for the
conduct of its business and shall submit monthly
reports to the Common Council on progress in this
respect until all such documents are in hand. Failure
of a grantee to pursue all necessary steps to secure the
aforementioned authorizations with due diligence shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
(2) Franchise applications shall include a
schedule for construction of the cable system,
including a timetable for commencement of cable
service to subscribers. Said schedule shall be
incorporated into the franchise agreement and shall be
20 Anderson - Business Regulations
enforceable as to a grantee under the provisions of this
chapter.
(3) Within 90 days after accepting a
franchise, a grantee shall furnish the city a copy of the
preliminary engineering drawings and an operating
construction schedule setting forth target dates by
areas for construction activity. The drawings and
schedule shall be updated whenever substantial
changes become necessary.
(4) Every three months after the start of
initial construction, or more frequently if requested by
the city, a grantee shall furnish the Common Council
a report on progress of construction until complete.
The report shall include a map that clearly defines the
areas wherein cable service to subscribers is available.
(B) New construction timetable.
(1) Within two years from the date of the
award of an initial franchise, a grantee must make
cable television service available to every residential
dwelling unit within the franchise area.
(a) A grantee must make cable
television service available to at least 20% of the
residential dwelling units within the franchise area
within six months from the date of the award of the
franchise.
(b) A grantee must make cable
television service available to at least 60% of the
residential dwelling units within the franchise area
within one year from the date of the award of the
franchise.
(c) A grantee must make cable
television service available to 100% of the residential
dwelling units within the franchise area within two
years from the date of the award of the franchise.
(2) The grantee in its application may
propose a timetable of construction which will make
cable television service available in the franchise area
sooner than the above minimum requirements, in
which case said schedule will be made part of the
franchise agreement, and will be binding upon a
grantee.
(3) Any delay beyond the terms of this
timetable, unless specifically approved by the city,
will be considered a violation of this chapter for which
the provisions of § 112.71 shall apply, as determined
by the city.
(4) In special circumstances and for good
cause shown by a grantee, the city in the exercise of
its sole discretion may waive 100% completion within
the two-year time frame, provided that substantial
completion is accomplished within the allotted time
frame, substantial completion to be not less than 95%.
Justification for less than 100% must be submitted
subject to the approval of the city.
(C) Line extensions and density requirements for
service.
(1) Following completion of construction
within the franchise area, each grantee shall extend its
cable system and make cable service available to areas
newly annexed by the city which do not yet receive
cable service as follows:
(a) Along public streets or parts of
public streets of newly-annexed areas, beginning at
the boundary of the prior franchise area or at any
trunk, feeder line extension or node beyond the prior
franchise area within three months after any such
public street reaches a minimum density of 32
dwelling units per street mile; and,
(b) Concurrently with the installation
of utility lines to newly-annexed developing areas
having a planned minimum density of 32 dwelling
units per street mile which lie contiguous to the
boundary of the prior franchise area or at the end of
any trunk or feeder line extensions or within the
service area of any node located beyond the prior
franchise area.
(2) Any grantee, in its new or renewal
application or proposal, may propose a line extension
policy which will result in serving more residents of
the newly-annexed areas of the city than as required
above, in which case a grantee’s proposal will be
incorporated by reference in the franchise agreement
and will be binding on a grantee.
Cable Television 21
(3) A grantee shall extend and make cable
television service available to any isolated resident
outside the initial service area requesting connection
at the standard connection charge if the connection to
the isolated resident would require no more than a
standard 125-foot drop line from grantee’s trunk or
feeder line.
(4) In areas not meeting the requirements
for mandatory extension of service, a grantee shall
provide upon the request of a potential subscriber
desiring service an estimate of its costs required to
extend service to the subscriber prior to starting
construction. A copy of the engineering report and
proof of payment will be submitted to the Board of
Works on areas exceeding ten homes. A grantee shall
then extend service upon request of the potential
subscriber.
(5) In the event the area subsequently
reaches the density required for mandatory extension
within 12 months from initial construction, such
payments shall be refunded within 12 months from
initial construction to the subscriber.
(D) Undergrounding.
(1) All installations shall be underground in
those areas of the city where utilities providing both
telephone and electric service are underground, except
as otherwise specifically approved in advance by the
city. In areas where either telephone or electric
facilities are aboveground at the time of installation, a
grantee may install its service aboveground, provided
that at such time those facilities are required to be
placed underground by the city or are placed
underground, a grantee shall likewise place its
services underground without additional cost to the
city or to the individual subscriber so served within
the city. Where not otherwise required to be placed
underground by this chapter, a grantee’s system shall
be located underground at the request of the adjacent
property-owner, provided that the excess cost over
aerial location shall be borne by the property-owner
making the request. Such underground installation
shall be constructed to the maximum extent with the
then-existing technology and in accordance with all
city codes, ordinances and state statutes.
(2) In cases of new construction or property
development where utilities are to be placed
underground, all cable system facilities also shall be
placed underground. If a grantee receives notice of
such new construction or property development,
including the date on which open trenching is
available for the grantee’s work (the “Notice”), then
a grantee shall provide to the developer or propertyowner
and to the city the specifications for its
trenching, and a grantee shall install its trunk or
feeder cable, pedestals and vaults and laterals within
48 hours after the trenches first become available to a
grantee for such work, provided grantee has received
prior reasonable notice of the availability of the
trench(es) unless weather conditions prohibit such
trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required
to bring service to the development shall be borne by
the developer or property owner; provided, however,
that if a grantee fails to install its trunk or feeder
cable, pedestals and vaults and laterals within said 48
hours subject to the foregoing, then the cost of any
new trenching and easements if necessary shall be
borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to a
grantee at the address stated in the franchise
agreement or to the local general manager or system
engineer of grantee. Written or oral notice from the
developer, property owner or city shall be sufficient
to qualify as the Notice.
(E) Property restoration
(1) In the event of disturbance of any public
street or public way, private property or improvement
on either of them by a grantee, it shall at its own
expense and in a manner approved by the Board of
Public Works or other appropriate governmental
authority and the owner replace and restore such
public street, public way, private property or
improvement in substantially as good a condition as
before the work causing such disturbance was done.
Where a public street or a public way has been
disturbed, a grantee shall restore said public street or
public way in accordance with the requirements of
applicable city codes and ordinances.
(2) In the event that a grantee fails to
perform such replacement or restoration within 30
days to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, the
Board of Public Works shall on prior notice to grantee
22 Anderson - Business Regulations
have the right to undertake remedial restoration
activities at the grantee’s cost, with such costs to be
chargeable against the security fund required of a
grantee herein below.
(3) In the event that a grantee has failed to
replace or restore private property, replacement or
restoration shall be at the sole expense of a grantee.
(4) Whenever in case of emergency it
becomes necessary in the judgment of the Mayor,
Chief of Police or Fire Chief, to remove or damage
any of a grantee’s facilities, no charge shall be made
by a grantee against the city for restoration or repair.
(F) Movement of buildings. At the request of
any person holding a valid building moving permit
issued by the city or other appropriate government
authority and upon at least five days advance written
notice, a grantee shall temporarily raise, lower or
remove its wires as may be necessary to facilitate such
move. The direct expenses of such temporary
changes, including standby time, shall be paid by the
permit-holder, and a grantee shall have the authority
to require payment in advance.
(G) Removal of vegetation.
(1) A grantee shall have the authority to
trim trees upon and overhanging public streets and
public ways that interfere with or come into contact
with the wires and cables of a grantee. However, all
trimming is to be done under the supervision and
direction of a designated city official(s) and at the
expense of grantee.
(2) Regardless of who performs the work
requested by a grantee, a grantee shall be responsible
and shall defend and hold city harmless from any and
all damages to any tree as a result of trimming or to
the property surrounding any tree, whether such tree
is trimmed or removed.
(3) The grantee shall have the authority to
trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of
its cable system in the service area at its own expense
so as to prevent branches from coming into contact
with the grantee’s wires, cables or other equipment,
subject to the supervision and direction of the
franchising authority. Trimming of trees on private
property shall require the written consent of the
property-owner when such may reasonably be
obtained.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.23 CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL

for node sites, transportation and trunk amplifiers for
a minimum of four hours.
(I) Plans and permits.
(1) Right to review; briefings.
(a) The city shall have the right to
review a grantee’s construction plans and
specifications prior to the commencement of any new
construction to assure compliance with the standards
specified in this chapter and to inspect all aspects of
cable system construction.
(b) The city shall not, however, be
required to review or approve such plans and
specifications or to make such inspections, and the
city specifically disclaims such obligation.
(c) A grantee shall be solely
responsible for taking all steps necessary to assure
compliance with such standards and to ensure that the
cable system is installed in a safe manner and pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this chapter and a
franchise agreement.
(2) A grantee shall within 90 days after the
completion date of cable system construction,
reconstruction or upgrade furnish to the city complete
“as-built” plans of the cable system and shall
thereafter furnish to the city amendments to such plans
within 45 days after completion of any extension or
modification of the cable system. These plans may be
submitted in an electronic format compatible with the
city’s Geographic Information System (GIS) if the
City Engineer and the grantee determine that such
plans can be provided electronically and if the grantee
has the ability to do so. If so requested in writing by
a grantee, the city shall keep such as-built plans
confidential to the extent allowable by law and shall
show such plans only to those employees, contractors
or city officials who need to see them as a part of their
responsibilities to the city or pursuant to their utilitylocating
responsibilities. The as-built plans shall not
be released to private parties for competitive purposes
in accordance with applicable law.
(3) A grantee shall secure all necessary
building and/or inspection permits which are required
or hereafter may be required by the ordinances of the
city before commencing any new construction of or
within the cable system, with specific permission
being required for the opening or disturbance of any
public street or public way within the city. The permit
application shall include a plan drawn in sufficient
detail to demonstrate to the city that the cable system
will be constructed in accordance with all applicable
codes and ordinances. Where cable is to be installed
on existing poles, the permit application shall include
a drawing showing the existing poles and additional
poles, if requested. No construction or other work
relating to such facilities within the public streets or
public ways of the city shall be commenced until the
city shall have approved and issued a permit on the
plans, specifications and methods for such work. Any
such permit may be so conditioned or restricted as
deemed necessary by the city to protect the public
health and safety of local residents. Grantee will
ensure that all subcontractors are operating in
compliance with all applicable federal and state laws
24 Anderson - Business Regulations
and local ordinances. Subcontractors will be as
specified in required permits if the work to be done
requires a permit.
(4) Without characterizing the violation of
other provisions of this chapter, the failure to obtain
said permits shall constitute a material violation of this
chapter.
(J) All work involved in the construction,
operation, maintenance, repair and removal of the
cable system or any part thereof shall be performed in
a workmanlike manner using materials of good and
durable quality. If at any time it is determined by the
city or any other agency or authority of competent
jurisdiction that any part of the cable system,
including without limitation any means used to
distribute signals over or within the cable system, is
harmful to the health or safety of any person, then a
grantee, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly
correct all such conditions. Any contractor,
subcontractor or other person proposed to be
employed for the installation, maintenance, relocation
or repair of cable system equipment or facilities shall
be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and
shall be thoroughly experienced in the work for which
he or she is retained.
(K) A grantee’s transmission and distribution
system, poles, wires, pipes, conduits, structures and
other appurtenances shall be located, erected and
maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the
lives of persons or to interfere with new improvements
that the city may deem proper to make or to
unnecessarily hinder or restrict the free use of the
public streets and public ways. The removal of poles,
wires, pipes, conduits, structures or other
appurtenances to avoid such interference shall be at a
grantee’s own expense.
(L) Excavation work and time periods.
(1) No excavation on or in any public
street, public way, public property or private property
in the city permitted hereunder in connection with the
installation of any cable system facilities shall be made
more than 24 hours immediately before installation of
such facilities. A grantee may apply for a waiver in
unusual circumstances.
(2) A grantee shall notify the Director of
the Board of Public Works or designated individual at
least 72 hours before any excavation on or in any
public street, public way, public property or private
property so that the Director of the Board of Public
Works or his or her designee will have the opportunity
to inspect such excavation work.
(3) From April 1 through November 15, all
excavations in lawns or grassy parkways shall be
backfilled, tamped and restored with sod within 30
calendar days in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
(M) Location of pedestals and vaults.
(1) Pedestals and similar above-ground
appurtenances.
(a) As of the effective date of this
chapter, where the city has determined that the
location of pedestals and similar aboveground
appurtenances located on a public street or public way
(other than in an alley or as provided in division (c)
below) or on public property will adversely affect the
appearance of the city and of the property therein and,
accordingly, pursuant to Section 541(a)(2) of the
Cable Act, a grantee shall not, except with the express
authority of the city, which authority shall not be
unreasonably withheld, install or locate a pedestal or
any similar above-ground appurtenance on any public
street or public way (other than in an alley or as
provided in division (c) below) or on any public
property as a part of any new construction or any
relocation or reinstallation.
(b) Pedestals or similar above-ground
appurtenances may be installed on private property
only with the express, prior written consent and
permission of the affected property-owner or his or
her authorized agent or the duly-elected or appointed
representative of the affected property; provided,
however, that such pedestals or above-ground
appurtenances shall comply with all applicable
provisions of the city’s municipal code.
(c) Notwithstanding division (b)
above, pedestals or similar above-ground
appurtenances may be installed within certain utility
Cable Television 25
easements on private property without the consent or
permission of the affected property-owner provided
that
1. A grantee is lawfully
authorized to use such utility easement pursuant to
state or federal law; and
2. The grantee’s pedestal or
similar above-ground appurtenance shall be located as
close as is practicable to said existing above-ground
appurtenance.
(2) Vaults. A grantee shall not install
underground vaults on any public street or public way
after the effective date of a franchise except in
accordance with and pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection. All underground vaults shall be flushmounted
with the surface of the land area.

initial installation of a cable system, a grantee shall
file with the city a construction letter of credit in the
amount of not less than 110% of the costs to install the
cable system in the franchise area contained in the
application proposal in favor of the city. This letter of
credit shall be maintained throughout the construction
period and until such time as determined by the city,
unless specified in the franchise agreement.
(B) Upgraded or reconstructed cable systems.
Prior to being approved for a reconstruction or
upgrade of the system that involves significant
excavation or other disturbance of a substantial
portion of the public streets and/or public ways as
determined by the city Engineer, a grantee shall file
with the city a construction letter of credit in the
amount of not less than $100,000. This letter of
credit shall be maintained throughout the upgrade
period and until such time as determined by the city
based upon notification of the completion of the

that the upgrade or reconstruction of the cable system
is complete, the requirement for the construction letter
of credit shall be rescinded.

the installation or upgrade of its cable system or fails
to well and truly observe, fulfill and perform each
term and condition of this chapter or of the franchise
as it relates to construction, installation or upgrade of
the system, after receipt of notice of such failure and
a reasonable period in which to cure, then there shall
be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal
and surety of the letter of credit the cost of completing
such construction and any damages or loss suffered by
the city as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or
abandonment of any property of the grantee plus a
reasonable allowance for attorney’s fees, including the

letter of credit may not be canceled by the surety nor

written notice of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
(E) Upon receipt of a 30-day notice and
grantee’s failure to commence and promptly proceed
to cure, this shall be construed as default granting the
city the right to demand payment on the letter of
credit.

chapter may in writing waive or reduce grantee’s
requirement to maintain a construction letter of credit.

Cable Television 33
additional reports, documents and information
necessary to enable the grantor to verify the payments
made to it by a grantee. Any additional amount due
the city as a result of an inspection shall be paid within
60 days following written notice to a grantee by the
city, which notice shall include a copy of the
inspection report. The cost of said inspection,
including any travel expenses incurred by the city or
its designee where such inspection necessitated travel
outside the Indianapolis metropolitan area, shall be
borne by a grantee if it is properly determined that
grantee’s annual payment due to the city for the
preceding year is increased thereby by more than 4%,
otherwise such costs shall be borne by the city and a
grantee equally.
(D) In the event that any franchise payment or
recomputed amount is not made on or before the
applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
charged from such date at an annual rate of two
percentage points over the prime rate given by Bank
One, N.A., to its most creditworthy borrowers of
demand loans as of the date of default.
(E) A grantee shall maintain books and records
of its operations within and related to the city and the
grantee’s cable system in sufficient detail to show
gross revenue by service category consistent with
generally-accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Said books and records shall be retained in accordance
with the grantee’s document retention policies, but in
no event less than five years.
(F) In the event that the franchise is revoked or
expires, a grantee shall file with the city within 45
days of such revocation or expiration a statement
clearly showing the gross revenues received by a
grantee since the end of the previous fiscal quarter. A
grantee shall pay such partial franchise fees due at the
time such statement is filed or within 45 days of such
revocation or expiration.
(G) The acceptance by the city of any franchise
fee payment shall not in any way be construed as an
accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct
amount, nor shall such acceptance of any payment be
construed as a release of any claim the city may have
for further or additional sums payable under the
provisions of the franchise. All franchise fee payments
shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the city
in accordance with this section.
(H) A grantee shall acknowledge as follows:
(1) The franchise fee is not a tax; and
(2) The franchise fee shall be in addition to
any and all taxes, other applicable fees or charges that
a grantee or any affiliate shall be required to pay to
the city or to any state or federal agency or authority,
all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations
of a grantee and its affiliates; and
(3) The term franchise fee does not include
any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability
(including such tax, fee or assessment imposed on
both utilities and cable operators or their services but
not including a tax, fee or assessment which is unduly
discriminatory against cable operators or cable
subscribers).
(4) Neither a grantee nor any affiliate shall
have or make any claim for any deduction or other
credit of all or any part of the franchise fee from or
against any of said city taxes or other fees or
assessments of general applicability that a grantee or
any affiliate is required to pay to the city except as
may be identified and authorized by federal or state
law; and
(5) Except as authorized by law, if a
grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply all or
any part of the amount of the franchise fee as a
deduction or other credit from or against any city tax
or other fee or assessment of general applicability or
if a grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply
all or any part of any such tax or other fee or
assessment of general applicability as a deduction or
other credit from or against the franchise fee, then, in
any such event, such action will be deemed a violation
of this chapter subject to the provisions of § 112.40
herein.
(I) The city may increase the franchise fee if
and to the extent that the maximum allowable
franchise fee is increased by an act of the United
States Congress, a court of competent jurisdiction or
the FCC. If the city desires to increase the franchise
34 Anderson - Business Regulations
fee in that event, then the city shall provide at least 60
days written notice to the grantee. If, within 60 days
after the city’s notice, a grantee so requests, the city
shall conduct a public meeting on the franchise fee
increase. The effective date of the proposed franchise
fee increase shall be delayed until the expiration of the
60-day notice period if within that period a grantee
does not request an opportunity to be heard at a public
meeting or, if an opportunity to be heard at a public
meeting is requested, until the conclusion of the public
meeting conducted pursuant to this division.

§ 112.13(C) herein above.
(B) Temporary service drops.
(1) A grantee shall put forth every effort to
bury temporary drops within 14 working days after
placement between March 1 and December 1, weather
permitting, unless a grantee receives permission to
delay burial. Temporary drops will be buried by a
grantee as expeditiously as possible, and in no event
will a drop which has been placed between November
15th of the prior year and March lst of the current
year be left unburied beyond May lst of the same
year, weather permitting. Any delays for any other
reason than weather, ground conditions, street
construction or system redesign will be communicated
to the city and copied to the subscriber.
(2) Upon request of the city, a grantee shall
provide a monthly report to the city on the number of
drops pending.
(C) A grantee shall render efficient service,
make a good faith effort to make repairs within 24
hours and interrupt service only for good cause and
for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions,
insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and
shall occur during periods of minimum system use.
(D) A grantee shall not allow its cable or other
operations to interfere with television reception of
subscribers or persons not served by the grantee; nor
shall the cable system interfere with, obstruct or
hinder in any manner the operation of the city’s
electrical utility and other various utilities serving the
residents within the confines of the city; nor shall
other utilities interfere with a grantee’s cable system.

(B) Any cable system shall provide a minimum
of 90 channels without regard to method of delivery or
capacity, stereo sound reproduction capacity where a
stereo signal is provided by the programmer and
platform expansion capability without regard to
technological format that enables a grantee to respond
to marketplace conditions for enhanced cable services.
(C) A grantee shall install electronic status
monitoring equipment at locations consistent with the
grantee’s engineering practices.
(D) A grantee shall design said cable system with
the capability to provide upstream and downstream
channel capacity. A grantee shall also operate and
maintain said cable system in a manner which will
enable continuous 24-hour operation of all services as
required herein.
(E) Upon request of the subscriber, a grantee
shall make available a “parental control” mechanism
or device that permits the subscriber to “lock out”
audible and visual reception of programming of the
subscriber’s choice. For purposes of this chapter, a
converter box which contains a micro-processing chip
that enables blocking or scrambling of cable-cast
signals shall meet the requirements of this section.

§ 112.47 PERIODIC TESTING AND
COMPLIANCE WITH FCC STANDARDS.
(A) A grantee shall construct and operate the
cable system to comply with the FCC technical
standards as contained in 47 U.S.C. 76, Subpart K of
the commission’s rules and regulations, as updated
and amended from time to time.
(B) A grantee shall perform all tests necessary to
determine compliance with the FCC technical
standards. Tests shall include, at minimum, proof-ofperformance
tests required by FCC Rule Section
76.601 (47 U.S.C. 76.601) and such additional or
repeat tests involving specific subscriber terminals as
may be required to determine compliance with the
FCC technical standards.
(C) Written records of test results shall be
maintained at a grantee’s local office and made
available for inspection by the city or other designated
agent of the city upon request of the city.
(D) The city or other designated agent of the city
may monitor and facilitate the enforcement of the
FCC technical standards referenced herein in
accordance with the Implementation of Cable Act
Reform Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, Report and Order in CS Docket No. 96-85,
FCC 99-57, released Mach 29, 1999 as directed by
the city.
(E) When repeated, material complaints
regarding the quality of video or audio service have
been made during the course of a periodic evaluation
session as described in § 112.56 below or where there
exists other evidence which in the judgment of the city
in consultation with the grantee casts doubt on the
reliability or quality of cable service, the city shall
have the right and authority to require a grantee to
test, analyze and report on the performance of the
system. A grantee shall fully cooperate with the city
in performing such testing and shall prepare results
and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice.
Such report shall include the following information:
(1) The nature of the complaint or problem
that precipitated the special tests;
(2) The system component(s) tested;
(3) The equipment used and procedures
employed in testing;
(4) The method, if any, in which such
complaint or problem was resolved; and
(5) Any other information pertinent to the
tests and analysis which may be required.
(F) If after receiving grantee’s report and after
a grantee has completed any corrective action
identified in the report the city determines that
reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate cable
system performance and the grantee fails to promptly
commence corrective action, then the city may enlist
an independent engineer at grantee’s expense to
perform tests and analysis directed toward such
suspected failures to meet the requirements of this
chapter. Grantee shall cooperate and permit such
testing.
(G) The city shall require tests, analysis and
reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on repeated material complaints or other
evidence only when the city has reasonable grounds to
believe that the complaints or other evidence require
that tests be performed to protect the public against
cable service which has significantly degraded video
and/or audio quality.
(H) The city may require the tests to be
supervised by a professional cable television engineer
to be approved by the city not on the staff of the
grantee. The engineer shall sign all records of special
tests and forward to the city such records with a report
interpreting the results of the test and recommending
action to be taken.

§ 112.50 CONTINUITY OF SERVICE
MANDATORY.
(A) In the event of revocation of a franchise,
expiration of a franchise or transfer of a franchise
between the existing grantee and a successor grantee,
the existing grantee shall continue to provide cable
service to its subscribers for a reasonable period of
time in the same manner and with the same types of
programming, customer service and repair capabilities
under the same terms and conditions as provided by a
franchise agreement and this chapter prior to the
change in the status of the franchise.
(B) If there is a change of franchise or if a new
cable operator or multichannel video provider acquires
the cable system, a grantee shall cooperate with the
city, new franchisee and operator in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers. During such
period, a grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for
any period during which it operates the system.

§ 112.51 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR
CONTROL.
(A) Except or as otherwise provided in the
franchise agreement, the franchise shall not be
assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet,
hypothecated or mortgaged either in whole or in part
disposed of, transferred in trust, pledged in whole or
in part by voluntary sale, merger, sale and leaseback
consolidation or otherwise or by forced or involuntary
sale without prior consent of the city expressed by
ordinance and then on such conditions as therein
maybe prescribed. Any sale, transfer or assignment
not made according to the procedures set forth in this
chapter shall render the franchise agreement void. The
sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of the major part
of the tangible assets of a grantee shall be considered
an assignment and shall be subject to the provisions of
this section.
(B) Any sale, transfer or assignment authorized
by the city shall be made by a bill of sale or similar
document, an executed copy of which shall be filed

assignment. The city shall not withhold its consent
unreasonably. The transferee must at a minimum
satisfy the legal, financial and technical qualifications
as established by the Act (47 U.S.C. 537) and
character qualifications as established for new
franchise applicants as stated in § 112.80 herein
below. A grantee shall assist the city in such inquiry
regarding these qualifications. In no event shall a
transfer of ownership or control be approved without
the successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement
agreeing in writing to comply with the terms,
obligations and conditions of the franchise agreement.
(C) Prior approval of the city shall be required
where ownership or control of more than 5% of the

of the franchise in any transaction or series of
transactions by a person or group of persons acting
individually or in concert, none of whom owned or
controlled 5% singularly or collectively on the
effective date of the franchise agreement. The word
“control” as used herein is not limited to major
stockholders but also includes actual working control
in whatever manner exercised. By its acceptance of
the franchise agreement, a grantee specifically grants
and agrees that any such acquisition occurring without
a prior approval of the city shall render the franchise
void.
(D) Subject to any limitations set forth in the
franchise agreement, any transfer of the grantee’s
cable system or any part thereof subject to the city’s
right of approval pursuant to division (A) hereof shall
also be subject to the city’s right to elect to acquire the
grantee’s system or the part thereof proposed to be
transferred for the consideration specified in a bona
fide purchase offer acceptable to the grantee. The city
shall exercise this right by written notice to a grantee
within 30 days following its receipt of the notice
required in division (E) of this section. Except for the
consideration, the city shall be obligated in exercising
this right to accept all other terms of the proposed
transfer. The city’s rights hereunder shall in no way
affect its independent rights under any other provision
of this chapter or under the franchise agreement.

OF CABLE SYSTEM.
(A) In the event that a franchise has been
revoked by the city and the city acquires ownership of
the cable system or effects a transfer of ownership of
the cable system to another person, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be governed by Section
627 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 547) or its successor
provision.
(B) If upon revocation of a grantee’s franchise
the city does not elect to purchase the cable system
and no sale of the cable system is made to a successor
grantee, then the city shall require that grantee
terminate and dismantle the cable system, including its

located within the boundaries of the city and related
appurtenances except that in the event that a grantee is
providing telecommunications services as defined by
the Cable Act, a grantee shall not be required to
remove those facilities which provide said services.
Upon completion of termination and dismantling of the
cable system, grantee shall upon direction of the city
restore any property, public or private, to substantially
the condition in which it existed prior to erection or

improvements made to such property subsequent to
construction of the system. Restoring of city property,
including all public streets and public ways as defined
herein, shall be in accordance with the directions and

Where a broadcaster providing over-the-air broadcast
service to a grantee has not reached an agreement with
a grantee for carriage of the broadcaster’s signal by
the deadline established by the FCC for consent to
transmit said broadcaster’s signal (“Retransmission
Consent”), a grantee shall not be obligated pursuant to
this chapter to carry said signal until such agreement
has been finalized.

designed to prohibit the presentation of any
advertising material designed to promote the sale of
commercial products or services, including advertising
by candidates for public office, lottery information
and programming in violation of any federal, state or
local law. The operator of the PEG channel shall keep
a complete record of the names and addresses of all
persons, groups or users requesting access time. In the
event that a grantee operates the PEG channel, it shall
provide said record to the franchising authority upon
request.
(2) Consistent with Section 612 of the cable Act
(47 U.S.C. 532), educational access programming on
the PEG channel shall not carry paid advertising to the

commercial use.
(3) At such time as the PEG access channel
has reached a level of live and taped programming
totaling 12 hours per day, five days per week, for a
total of eight weeks, including play-backs, which
necessitates the provision of a second access channel
for educational access or governmental access
programming, the grantee, the city and any other
educational access channel users shall meet and confer
with a grantee to establish the creation of a second
access channel for either governmental or educational
access programming. Where a second PEG access
channel is created, the grantee shall, wherever
possible, cluster the PEG access channels together.

programming. In the event that there is more than one
cable operator or multichannel video provider
providing cable service to the franchise area, the city

provided programming produced by the city for any
access programming channel to any cable operator or
multichannel video provider if such cable operator or
multichannel video provider provides a separate,
direct link to the point of origination. Where a grantee

§ 112.80 LIMITS ON GRANTEE RECOURSE.
(A) To the extent that any laws immunize the
city and its officials, boards, commissions, agents or
employees, a grantee shall have no recourse
whatsoever against the city or its officials, boards,
commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs,
expense or damages arising out of any provision or
requirement of this chapter or the franchise
agreement. A grantee shall expressly acknowledge
that, upon accepting the right, privilege and franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter, it does so relying
50 Anderson - Business Regulations
upon its own investigation and understanding of the
power and authority of the city. By the acceptance of
a franchise, a grantee shall agree that it will not at any
time set up against the city in any claim or
proceeding, any provision, condition or term of the
ordinance, this chapter or the franchise agreement as
unreasonable, arbitrary or void or that the city had no
authority to make such provision, term or condition as
part of or pursuant to the ordinance, except as to those
matters preempted by federal or state law.
(B) Within a franchise agreement, a grantee shall
acknowledge that it has not been induced to accept a
franchise by any promise, verbal or written, by or on
behalf of the city or by any third person regarding any
term or condition of the franchise not otherwise
expressed herein. A grantee shall further be deemed
to warrant that no promise or inducement, oral or
written, has been made to any city employee or
official regarding receipt of the franchise, other than
as contained in the franchise.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.81 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
In the event of a violation or an alleged violation
of the franchise by a grantee, the city by suit, action,
mandamus or other proceeding in law or in equity
may enforce or compel the performance of the terms
of the franchise to the full allowable extent. In the
event of a judicial proceeding, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred in connection with such judicial proceeding.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.82 WAIVER.

of an applicant for a franchise or a grantee for good
cause shown waive any requirement of this chapter.

deemed to be of the essence.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.84 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
The express provisions of this chapter as it now
exists will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent
provisions of other municipal ordinances or conflicting
or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement
unless a franchise agreement expresses an explicit
intent to waive or modify strict compliance with a
requirement of this chapter. Provided, however, that
no change in this chapter made by the city after the
effective date of a franchise agreement shall amend
the express provisions of a franchise agreement
without an amendment to the franchise agreement
which has been agreed upon by the city and a grantee.
Neither party may take any unilateral action which

§ 112.87 GOVERNING LAW.
This chapter shall be governed in accordance
insofar as applicable with the laws of the State of
Indiana. Where federal jurisdiction applies, this
chapter shall be governed by the applicable laws and
agencies of the United States Government. Venue
shall be in either the Circuit Court of Madison County
or the United States District Court, Southern District
of Indiana.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 8-2-02)
§ 112.99 PENALTIES.
A grantee shall comply with the requirements of
this chapter and the franchise agreement at all times
during the term of its franchise. If the city has reason
to believe that a grantee has committed a certain
violation of this chapter or the franchise agreement
including those described in § 112.70(A)(1) through
(12) above, the city may act to remedy the violation.
(A) Remedies retained. No provision of this
chapter shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the
right of the city to seek or obtain judicial relief from
a violation of any provision of the franchise or any
rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated
thereunder. Neither the existence of other remedies
identified in this chapter nor the exercise thereof shall
be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the
city to recover monetary damages, except where
liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed, for such
violation by the grantee or judicial enforcement of the
grantee’s obligations by means of specific
performance, injunctive relief or mandate or any other
remedy available contractually at law or in equity.
(B) Fine imposed. Unless otherwise provided,
a grantee or any person convicted of violating any
provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
promulgated hereunder shall upon conviction be
subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 and costs for
each offense. Each day of a continuing violation shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense.
(C) Liquidated damages. A franchise agreement
shall include provisions for liquidated damages to be
paid by a grantee in amounts set forth in the franchise
agreement and chargeable to a security fund.
(D) Violation procedures.
(1) Notice of violations. Written notice
shall be given to a grantee setting forth the nature of
the violation and a reasonable period of time for a
grantee to correct the violation. Unless the city
determined that the violation is of such a nature that a
lesser period of time is warranted for remedying the
violation, a grantee shall be given 30 days after
receipt of such notice to remedy the violation.
(2) Answer to notice of violations. Within
30 days or other such period of time specified by the
city in its notice to a grantee, a grantee shall respond
in writing to the city:
(a) That it contests the city’s notice of
violation and requests an opportunity to be heard as
provided herein. A grantee shall submit supporting
documentation with its response to the notice.
(b) That it contests the city’s notice of
violation for the reasons that the violation was beyond
the reasonable control of a grantee and requests an
opportunity to be heard as provided herein. A grantee
shall submit supporting documentation with its
response to the notice.
(c) That a grantee will remedy the
violation within the time specified by the city in its
notice to the grantee.
(d) If a grantee contends that an
extended period of time is reasonably needed to
remedy the violation, it shall submit a written request
for an extension together with supporting
52 Anderson - Business Regulations
documentation that a grantee cannot reasonably
remedy the violation within the time specified by the
city in its notice to a grantee. The city shall not
unreasonably deny an extension of time to remedy the
violation. If the city grants the extension, a grantee
shall proceed to remedy the violation within the
extended time period prescribed, provided that a
grantee also informs the city on a regular basis of the
steps being taken to remedy the violation.
(3) Opportunity to be heard. The city shall
give a grantee not less than 14 calendar days written
notice of the date, time and place of the public
meeting to be held before the Board of Works. A
grantee shall be entitled to the right to present
evidence and the right to be represented by counsel.
At the public meeting, the Board of Works shall hear
and determine the issues and render its findings and
decision.
(4) Determination. The Board of Works
shall determine at a public meeting with grantee
having the opportunity to be present and heard
whether or not a substantial violation, breach or
default by a grantee has occurred; whether it has been
cured or a satisfactory corrective action plan has been
submitted and is being actively and diligently pursued;
and whether cause exists to revoke the franchise or
impose a lesser sanction. In the event that the city
determines that it has cause to revoke the franchise, it
shall send notice of revocation to a grantee within ten
business days of the city’s determination. In the event
that the Board of Works is persuaded after a grantee’s
opportunity to be heard in a public meeting that a
grantee has committed a violation for which a lesser
sanction other than revocation is warranted, the Board
of Works may, after giving a grantee an opportunity
to be heard:
(a) Order a grantee to remedy the
violation within a reasonable period of time specified
by the Board of Works.
(b) Assess liquidated damages against
a grantee in accordance with a franchise agreement
and to exercise any other remedy provided in this
chapter or the franchise agreement.
(c) Impose any lesser sanction
permitted by a franchise agreement.
(5) The city shall not exercise any right
without a resolution approved by the Board of Works.
(6) Judicial relief. No provision of this
section shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the
right of the franchising authority to seek or obtain
judicial relief to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

§ 153.06 SITES, STRUCTURES, AND
DISTRICTS; REGISTRATION OF
LANDMARKS.
(A) If the Common Council finds that a site,
structure, or district is of historical or cultural
significance and is suitable for preservation, the
Common Council may establish such area by
ordinance as a historic and cultural preservation site,
structure, or district. In the absence of provisions to
the contrary in the ordinance creating any such
Historic and Cultural Preservation Plan 39
district, all regulations of the zoning district within
which such district is situated shall continue to apply.
However, in order to preserve and protect historic
landmarks in such a district, it may be necessary to
regulate such district with provisions different from
those which could normally apply in the zoning
district within which such district is situated.
Therefore, any use or other provision which is
applicable in any zoning district may be permitted in
any other zoning district, provided that such use or
provision will not adversely affect the use of lands
adjacent to or reasonably proximate to the landmark.
(B) The ordinance may be initiated by petition of
the Common Council, or of the Plan Commission, or
of the Preservation Commission, or of the owners of
50% or more of the area involved.
(C) If the petitioner request regulation of the
historic area by provisions other than those which
could otherwise apply in the zoning district within
which such historic area is situated, then the petitioner
shall also prepare and file with the petition an
application for historic landmark usage, which shall
state the specific use or provisions sought in the
regulation of such historic area and the reasons
therefor. Such petition shall be filed with the City
Clerk, who shall immediately refer the same to the
Preservation Commission.
(D) Prior to the petition and consideration of any
single site or structure as a historic site or structure
the property owner of record of that single site or
structure must grant approval of his property to be
considered for a historic designation. If the owner
refuses to grant approval of the historic designation,
then further consideration of historic designation for
that site or structure shall be immediately terminated
for a period of at least one year.
(E) Upon receipt by the Preservation
Commission the Planning Department shall investigate
the property which is the subject of such petition and
shall prepare a written report for the Preservation
Commission.
(F) At the next regularly scheduled meeting of
the Preservation Commission following its receipt of
the Plan Department’s report, such petition shall be
considered by the Commission which shall then
recommend to the Plan Commission that such petition
be approved, as submitted or as modified by the
Preservation Commission, or that such petition be
denied.

hearing on such petition and recommendation by the
Preservation Commission. At least ten days prior to
the date set for such hearing, the Plan Commission
shall publish, in a newspaper of general circulation in
the city, a notice of the time and place of such
hearing. Additional notice to the owners of land
involved in such petition or surrounding land may be
required by the rules of the Plan Commission.
Following such hearing, the Plan Commission shall
consider such petition and shall recommend to the
Council either that such petition be approved, as
submitted or as modified by the Plan Commission, or
that such petition be denied.
(H) Thereafter, an ordinance relative to such
petition shall be prepared and submitted to the
Council, which shall proceed with the consideration of
such proposed ordinance in the same manner and
subject to the same voting requirements as would
apply in the case of an ordinance to rezone land,
provided that the Council may amend such proposed
ordinance prior to its adoption in any manner it may
deem necessary to accomplish the purpose of this
section.
(I) In designated historic sites, structures, or
districts, all proposed right-of-ways included in the
thoroughfare plan as a part of the Comprehensive Plan
for the city that are described as arterial primary,
arterial secondary, and parkway are exempted from
the provisions of this chapter. However, the proposed
right-of-ways in the thoroughfare plan for the city
described as feeder and residential routes shall be
included under all provisions of this chapter.
(J) There is created by the passage of this
chapter a register of historic and cultural landmarks.
The register shall list all historic and cultural
landmarks and all historic and cultural preservation

state law shall commence any development in the
SFHA without first obtaining an improvement location
permit.
(B) All records, including lowest floor
elevations, plans, certificates of occupancy, and other
materials associated with an improvement location
permit shall be maintained by the City Plan
Commission.
(C) In reviewing all applications for
improvement location permits for compliance with the
requirements of this section, the Planning Director
shall assure that all necessary permits for other state,
federal, and local agencies have been obtained.
(D) In reviewing the application for an
improvement location permit, the Planning Director
shall determine if the site is located within an
identified floodway, floodway fringe or within the
floodplain where the limits of the floodway have not
yet been determined.
(1) If the site is in an identified floodway,
the Planning Director shall require the applicant to
forward the application, along with all pertinent plans
and specifications, to the Department of Natural
Resources and apply for a permit for construction in
the floodway.
(2) Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1-1
et seq., a permit from the Natural Resources
Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local
permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or
preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing
45

and paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of
construction of the building.
(3) No action shall be taken by the Planning
Director until a permit has been issued by the Natural
Resources Commission granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been
issued by the Natural Resources Commission, the
Planning Director may issue the improvement location
permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§ 160.41 and 160.42 have been met. The
improvement location permit cannot be less restrictive
than the permit issued by the Natural Resources
Commission.
(E) If the site is located in an identified floodway
fringe, then the Planning Director may issue the
improvement location permit provided the provisions
contained in §§ 160.41 and 160.42 have been met.
The key provision is the top of the lowest floor of any
new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the Flood Protection Grade (FPG).
(F) If the site is in an identified floodplain where
the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have
not yet been determined (shown as “Zone A” on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map), and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile,
the Planning Director shall require the applicant to
forward the application along with all pertinent plans
and specifications to the Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment. No action shall
be taken by the Planning Director until either a permit
for construction in the floodway or a letter of
recommendation citing the 100-year flood elevation
and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has
been received from the Department of Natural
Resources. When this information is received, the
improvement location permit may be issued provided
the provisions of the improvement location permit are
not less restrictive than the conditions of the letter for
construction in the floodway as received from the
Natural Resources Commission, and the provisions
contained in §§ 160.41 and 160.42 have been met.

§ 156.11 DESIGNATION OF
THOROUGHFARES.
The thoroughfares comprising the Thoroughfare

(‘64 Code, § 158.11) (Ord. 9-62, passed 5-9-62)
§ 156.12 OPENING OR WIDENING OF
STREETS.
Whenever a street classified in the Thoroughfare
Plan is to be platted as a part of a subdivision, the
required right-of-way width for such street shall be as
specified in the Thoroughfare Plan, provided that
where a street borders a tract of land to be subdivided,
the owner of such land shall be required to plat only
l/2 of the right-of-way width designated for such
street, measured at 90 degrees to the center line
thereof.
(‘64 Code, § 158.12) (Ord. 9-62, passed 5-9-62)
§ 156.13 LOCATION OF STREETS.
(A) Wherever the location of a street is indicated
in the Thoroughfare Plan as following an existing road
or street, or a section, half-section, or other
established property line, the location of the street
shall conform to such location. However, a street
lying wholly within a subdivision, and not designated
as following an existing road or established property
line, may be varied in its alignment when such
Comprehensive Plan 51
variance promotes the plan of a neighborhood
development unit in accordance with good site
planning principles, and if such alignment provides for
the continuity of traffic movement.
(B) Wherever the location of a street is indicated
in the Thoroughfare Plan as following an irregular
alignment, or a revised alignment or is not referenced
to an established line, it shall follow the alignment
shown in the Thoroughfare Plan. Such alignment shall
be subject to a detailed survey which may be made by
the Commission or other public agencies, or by the
owners of land to be subdivided if required by the
Commission. The survey for such street shall be
subject to the approval of the Commission prior to the
dedication of the street.

alteration, relocation, or abandonment of the public
streets, highways, and related structures.
(‘64 Code, § 158.14) (Ord. 9-62, passed 5-9-62)

Any permits authorized by the city, including but
not limited to, improvement location permits,
permitting the erection, alteration, or relocation of
structures and other improvements within the
jurisdiction of the City Plan Commission, shall be
issued only if, in addition to satisfying the
requirements of other city ordinances, the proposed
street right-of-way as set forth by this chapter will be
protected from encroachment. In this instance, the
proposed street right-of-way lines will be considered
as the front line of lots and tracts bordering such
street.

§ 156.16 STREET IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
(A) The Board of Public Works is authorized to

(2) The cost of grading and excavating in
connection with the improvement of alleys and streets
existing at the time of the passage of this chapter is to
be considered a city expense and not as a part of the

(3) The cost of grading and excavating in
connection with the improvement of streets and alleys
hereafter dedicated is not to be considered a part of
the improvement cost in which the city can participate.
(4) The city may participate to the extent of
50% of the cost of improving an alley located in a
business or industrial district as shown in the city zone
map; the city shall not participate in the cost of
improving alleys other than those indicated above.
(5) The amount of the participation by the
city in the cost of street improvements is indicated in
division (B) below as a percentage of the total of such
cost, as may be modified by preceding statements, in
accordance with the street designation and width of
surface to be improved, which shall not include curb

§ 157.01 MOVING OF BUILDINGS;
REQUIREMENTS OF NEW LOCATION.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or
corporation to move any brick, frame, or other
building from one location to another, unless the same
shall be altered or reconstructed so as to conform to
the class of construction required in its new location.
(‘64 Code, § 135.l) (Ord. 37-61, passed 12-12-61)
Penalty, see § 157.99
§ 157.02 PERMIT REQUIRED.
No building shall be moved to a new location
over any street, place, bridge, or waterway within the
city limits unless a permit therefor is first obtained
from the City Engineer as hereinafter provided. Such
moving shall be subject to the supervision and
approval of the City Engineer.

§ 157.03 APPLICATION; ISSUANCE OF
PERMIT.
Any person desiring such removal shall file with
the office of the City Engineer a written application
for such permit accompanied by a non-refundable
application fee of $100, setting forth the kind of
building intended to be removed, its estimated original
cost, its dimensions and extreme length, width, and
height, its present location, and the particular lot or
site to which it is proposed to be moved. The City
Civil Engineer shall thereupon examine the building
and refer such application to the Board of Public
Works, together with his opinion, accompanying or
endorsed in writing on the application, whether the
proposed removal can be made without serious injury
to person or property. However, no such building
shall be moved to a new location, if it has been
damaged by wear and tear or other cause to an extent
which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, would
render the building to be of little or no value. If the
Board of Public Works finds that such removal and
relocation can be made without serious injury to
pavements, curbs and other public improvements of
public highways, streets, and alleys and other public
or private property, it shall issue a preliminary
approval therefor, designating therein the particular
highways, streets, boulevards, or public places along
which the removal shall be made and the time within
which such removal shall be completed and shall
deliver a copy of such preliminary approval to the
City Engineer, whereupon the City Engineer may
issue a permit for such removal on the filing of a bond
as provided in § 157.04 and subject to all conditions
herein prescribed for such work.

PROCEDURE
§ 159.10 PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.
(A) In order to make the most of the
opportunities related to the subdivision of land and to
conserve time, effort, and expense, the owner or
subdivider should consult with the Department,
Engineer, or other agencies prior to the preparation of
the primary plan of the subdivision. School and
recreational sites; shopping centers; community
facilities; sanitation, water supply, and drainage; and
relationship to other developments, existing and
proposed, in the vicinity, should be determined in
advance of the preparation of the subdivision plan.
(B) Consultation should also be held with those
familiar with the economic factors affecting the
subdivision. A thorough estimate of the situation will
result in sound decisions with respect to the form,
character, and extent of the proposed subdivision.
(C) No land shall be subdivided for residential
use unless adequate access to the land over improved
streets or thoroughfares exists or will be provided by
subdivider, or if the land is considered by the
Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of
flooding or improper drainage, objectionable earth and
rock formation, topography, or any other feature
harmful to the health and safety of possible residents
and the community as a whole.
(D) The Plan Commission shall review all
proposed subdivisions to determine whether the
subdivision lies in a Special Flood Hazard Area. If
the proposed subdivision is found to be so located,
then the Plan Commission shall forward plans and
materials along with other pertinent information to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for their
review and comment. The Plan Commission shall
require appropriate changes and modifications in order
to assure that the proposed subdivision is consistent
with the need to minimize flood damages; all public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems are located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate
drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards; and on-site waste disposal systems, if
provided, will be so located and designed to avoid
impairment of them or contamination from them
during the occurrence of a regulatory flood.
(E) All owners of manufactured/mobile home
parks located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas
identified as “Zone A” on the community’s Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps or Flood Insurance Rate Maps
shall develop an evacuation plan for those lots located
in the Special Flood Hazard Area and file it with the
local Plan Commission and have it filed with and
approved by the appropriate community emergency
management authorities.

appropriate, shall be extended to the boundary lines of
the tract to be subdivided so as to provide for normal
circulation of traffic within the vicinity.
(4) Wherever there exists a dedicated or
platted portion of a street, or alley adjacent to the
proposed subdivision, the remainder of the street or
alley to the prescribed width should be platted within
the proposed subdivision.

contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or a
highway designated as a limited access highway by the
appropriate highway authorities, provision shall be
made for a marginal access street, or a parallel street
at a distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the
land between the highway or railroad and these
streets.

highway or arterial street.
(D) Lots.
(1) All lots shall abut on a street, cul-desac,
or place.
(2) Side lines of lots shall be at approximate
right angles to straight streets and on radial lines on
curved streets. Some variation from this rule is
permissible but pointed or very irregular lots should
be avoided.
(3) Double frontage lots should not be
platted, except that where desired along arterial,
limited access highways or streets, lots may face on an
interior street and back on these thoroughfares. In
that event, a planting strip at least 20 feet in width for
a screen shall be provided along the back of the lot.
(4) Widths and areas of residential lots shall
be not less than provided in the zoning code for
single-family dwellings for the district in which the
subdivision is located, except that when a water main
supply system or a sanitary sewer system is not
available, the lot area necessary to install a private
water supply or private sewage disposal on the lot in
accordance with the State and County Boards of
Health regulations shall become the required minimum
lot area.
(a) The lot width of rectangular
residential lots that abut or are adjacent to lots in
previously platted subdivisions must equal at least
90% of the lot width of the average existing platted
lots. However, in no case shall the minimum lot width
requirement exceed 90 feet.
(b) The lot area of irregularly shaped
lots (i.e. those on cul de sacs etc.) that abut or are
adjacent to existing platted lots must equal at least
100% of the lot area of those lots to which they are
adjacent to or abutted.
Subdivision Control 77
(5) Whenever possible, unit shopping
centers, based upon sound development standards
should be designed in contrast to the platting of lots
for unrestricted commercial use.
(6) Corner residential lots shall be wider
than normal in order to permit appropriate and
continuous setbacks from both streets.
(E) Easements. Where alleys are not provided,
easements for utilities shall be provided. These
easements shall have minimum widths of 15 feet, and
where located along lot lines, one half the width shall
be taken from each lot. When these easements are to
be located along the boundary of the plat, the full
width of the easement may be required within the plat
at the discretion of the Commission. Before preparing
the final plat, the plan of easements shall be discussed
with the local public utilities to assure their proper
placement for the installation of these services.
(F) Building setback lines. These lines shall be
as provided in the zoning code or as the Commission
may determine, but in no case shall it be less than
20% of the lot depth. In the case of very deep lots the
maximum lot depth to be considered shall be 150 feet
subject to § 159.21(B)(1)(a)2. or unless specifically
required otherwise by the Commission.
(G) Public open spaces. Where proposed sites
for parks, schools, playgrounds, or other public uses
are located within the subdivision area, or where these
sites appear to be desirable, the Commission may
request their reservation for a period of one year
following the date of the final approval of the plat. In
the event a governmental agency concerned passes a
resolution expressing its intent to acquire the land so
reserved, the reservation period shall be extended for
an additional six months.
(H) Drainage right-of-way. Whenever a
subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage
way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a
drainage right-of-way, notwithstanding the provisions
of the Madison County Drainage Board, which shall
be for the purpose of widening, improving, or
protecting the stream. The width of the drainage
right-of-way shall be adequate for any necessary
channel relocations and straightenings. Parallel streets
may be required in connection therewith.
(I) Developers shall record the 100-year flood
elevation on subdivision plats containing lands
(identified elsewhere by this and other ordinances)
within a flood hazard area prior to submitting the plats
for approval by the Plan Commission.

provide for the disposal of sewage in the subdivision
by one of the following methods.
(a) Sewerage system.
1. A complete sanitary sewer
system which shall connect with a sanitary sewer
outlet approved by the City Engineer and the Board of
Public Works.
2. A complete sanitary sewer
system which shall be plugged and capped when a
sanitary sewer outlet is not available within a

Department, and the State Board of Health.
2. Private sewage disposal
system on individual lots consisting of a septic tank
and tile absorption field or other approved sewage
disposal system, when laid out in accordance with
minimum standards of the County Health Department,
and the State Board of Health.
Note: In division (4) sewage disposal and in division
(5), water supply, the phrase THE SUBDIVIDER
SHALL PROVIDE shall be interpreted to mean that
the subdivider shall install the facility referred to or,
whenever a private sewage disposal system or an
individual water supply is to be provided, that the
subdivider shall require as a condition of the sale of
each lot or parcel in the subdivision, that the facilities
referred to in these divisions shall be installed by the
developer of the lots in accordance with these
regulations. In all instances the subdivider shall
provide a complete sanitary sewer system as specified
in division (4)(a)2. above within the boundaries of the
subdivision even though no sanitary sewer outlet is
available.
Subdivision Control 81
(5) Water supply. The subdivider shall
provide the subdivision with a source of water for
domestic use by one of the following methods.
(a) Water main system. A complete
water main supply system which shall be connected to
the water utility system serving the city.
(b) Private supply. An individual
water supply on each lot in the subdivision in
accordance with the minimum requirements of the
County Health Departments.
(6) Storm drainage and sediment control.
(a) General requirements. The
subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a storm
drainage system adequate to convey expected rainfall
as follows: the storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer
system. The Commission shall not recommend for
approval any subdivision plat which does not make
adequate provision for storm or floodwater runoff
through properly designed conduits, channels, or
basins. Storm drainage systems shall be designed
according to the storm drainage and sediment control
ordinance for the city. Copies of the design
computations shall have been submitted and approved
with development plans for the project.
(b) Design criteria.
1. The plans for the construction
of the required drainage facilities shall be based upon
a report which includes an evaluation of the proposed
development, tributary drainage areas, outfall
conditions, and impact upon the overall drainage
systems of the general area. The principal criteria to
be observed is that the release rate of storm water
from the developments may not exceed the storm
water runoff from the land area in its present state of
development, or the present capacity of the receiving
channel. Hydrograph techniques or computer
modeling methods shall be used for areas larger than
200 acres.
2. The subdivider shall be
required to carry away water by either conduit or open
channel from either storm or high ground water
conditions that may exist either previously to, or as a
result of, the proposed subdivision. The drainage
facilities provided shall be located in the street rightof-
way where feasible, or in perpetual, unobstructed
easements of appropriate width. Maintenance
covenants or agreements shall be provided by the
subdivider or subsequent lot owners in the case of
easements for the perpetual maintenance of the
drainage facilities.
3. Outflow discharge rates from
the subdivision drainage system shall be based upon
the runoff standards of the storm drainage and
sediment control ordinance on the existing
undeveloped property. The outflow discharge rates
may be further restricted if the City Engineer and
Commission determine the receiving facility is
inadequate to handle the flow.
4. Inlets and catch basins shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or
around any intersection, nor for a distance of more
than 600 feet in the gutters or when the encroachment
of storm water into the streets impedes traffic. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded
at a point, no further flow shall be permitted beyond
that point and inlets or catch basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. The grading plan shall
include surface water drainage patterns for each and
every lot and block for the entire proposed area to be
drained.
5. Subsurface drains shall be
constructed at all street grade low points to a
minimum distance of 100 feet either side of the low
point parallel to and one foot outside the back of each
curb line. These subsurface drains shall be connected
to the drainage structures located at the street low
points. The placement of additional subsurface drains
may be required by the City Engineer in areas affected
by high ground water tables.
6. Design accommodations shall
be provided with the drainage system for all upstream
drainage areas whether inside or outside the proposed
subdivisions. These calculations shall be based upon
the storm drainage and sediment control ordinance.
82 Anderson - Land Usage
7. Areas which are not in the
floodway but contain soils which are subject to
flooding may be approved for subdivision by the
Commission, provided that the subdivider fills the
affected areas of the subdivision in an acceptable
manner to an elevation sufficient to place building
sites and streets two feet above ponding levels.
8. In areas characterized by soils
having a high seasonal water table as determined by
the Madison County Soil and Water Conservation
District, lots shall be limited to slab-type constructions
unless the Commission determines that appropriate
engineering techniques will be applied to alleviate the
subsurface problem.
9. If a subdivision of land is
proposed within the floodway it shall be preserved and
not diminished in capacity by filling or obstruction,
except as approved by the Natural Resources
Commission in writing. No residential building site
may be located within the floodway.
10. Where a subdivision is
proposed in an area of the floodway designated as a
floodway fringe, the Commission may approve the
subdivision provided that all lots for residential usage
have a flood protection grade two feet above the
regulatory flood elevation; where provided, water and
sanitary sewer facilities are constructed to eliminate
contamination of or by, flood water; and, approval to
fill the area from the Natural Resources Commission
has been obtained in writing.
11. Where a subdivision is
proposed within an area of the floodway plain for
which floodway and floodway fringe designations
have not been made, the Commission shall not
approve the subdivision unless all streets are raised
sufficiently to be above the regulatory flood elevation;
all lots for residential usage have a flood protection
grade of two feet above the regulatory flood elevation;
where provided, public water and sanitary sewer
facilities are constructed to eliminate contamination of
or by flood water; and, filling to achieve the above
will not raise the level of the regulatory flood
elevation more than l/10 of one foot for that reach of
the stream. All filling in the floodway must be
approved in writing by the State Natural Resources
Commission.
12. Recording of plats in the
floodway and floodway fringe. All final plats having
within their boundaries areas whose elevation is below
that of the regulatory flood elevation shall show and
label the regulatory flood boundary and elevation, as
of the date the final plat is drawn, on the final plat for
recording.
(7) Street signs. Standard city street signs
shall be installed by the subdivider at all street
intersections.
(8) Street lights. A street lighting system
shall be provided by the subdivider in accordance with
the recommendations of the Municipal Electric Utility.
(‘64 Code, § 157.8) (Ord. 2317, passed 11-9-56;
Am. Ord. 25-75, passed 9-25-75; Am. Ord. 33-78,
passed 12-18-78; Am. Ord. 6-85, passed 7-11-85)
§ 159.22 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
(A) General provisions.
(1) If a proposed subdivision includes land
that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes,
the layout of the subdivision with respect to the land
shall make such provision as the Commission may
require.
(2) A nonresidential subdivision shall be
subject to all the requirements of site plan approval set
forth in the zoning code. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed
simultaneously at the discretion of the Commission.
(3) A nonresidential subdivision shall also
be subject to all the requirements of these regulations,
as well as such additional standards required by the
Commission, and shall conform to the proposed land
use and standards established in the Comprehensive
Plan.
Subdivision Control 83
(B) Additional provisions and standards. In
addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of
all subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Commission that the street - parcel -
block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the
uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in
the vicinity. The following principles and standards
shall be observed.
(1) Each nonresidential area or parcel shall
be shown and marked on the plat as to its intended
use.
(2) Proposed parcels shall be suitable in
area and dimensions to the types of development
anticipated.
(3) Special requirements may be imposed
by the Board of Public Works with respect to street,
curb, driveway, and sidewalk design and construction.
(4) The City Engineer shall approve in
writing, prior to final plat approval, a provision that
the proposed nonresidential development will not
conflict with traffic circulation patterns, and the
requirements for driveway location and design can
reasonably be implemented at no cost to the city or
state.
(5) Special requirements may be imposed
by the Board of Public Works with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer,
street lighting, electrical service, and storm water
facilities.
(6) Every effort shall be made to protect
adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from
a proposed nonresidential subdivision, including the
provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on
existing or potential residential development and
provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip
when necessary.
(7) Truck routes shall be established so as
to prevent industrial traffic from encroaching into
adjacent residential areas.
(8) To the greatest degree possible,
nonresidential subdivisions shall be located on major
thoroughfares or arterials, and local residential streets
shall not, to the extent feasible, be extended into
nonresidential subdivisions.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 160.01 TITLE.
This chapter and ordinances supplemental or
amendatory thereto, shall be known, and may be cited
hereafter as the zoning code.
(‘64 Code, § 150.1) (Ord. 2439, passed 2-9-60)
§ 160.02 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this
zoning code, they shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general
welfare. This chapter also guides development in the
flood hazard areas in order to reduce the potential for
loss of life and property, reduce the potential for
health and safety hazards, and to reduce the potential
for extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief including the prevention of
unwise developments from increasing flood or
drainage hazards to others; the protection of new
buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage; the protection of human life and health
from the hazards of flooding; the lessening of the
burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities,
and the flood rescue and relief operations; the
maintaining of property values and a stable tax base
by minimizing the potential for creating flood blighted
areas; and the making available the federally
subsidized flood insurance for structures and their
contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program. The City Plan
Commission has given consideration to the future
probable use of land in the territory affected by this
zoning code, and has prepared a comprehensive land
use plan showing the future development of this area
which has served as a guide in the preparation of this
code. It is not intended by this code to interfere with,
or abrogate, or annul any easements, covenants, or
other agreements between parties, nor to interfere
with, or abrogate, or annul any ordinances, rules,
regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued,
and not in conflict with any of the provisions of this
code, or which shall be adopted or provided, except
that where this code imposes a greater restriction on
the use of buildings or land, or on the height of
buildings, or requires larger open spaces or greater lot
area per family, then are required or imposed by such
easements, covenants, or agreements between parties
or by such ordinances, rules, regulations, or permits,
the provisions of this code shall control.
(‘64 Code, § 150.2) (Ord. 2439, passed 2-9-60; Am.

principal means of access to abutting property.
(1) COLLECTOR. Collectors provide both
land access service and traffic circulation within
residential neighborhoods, commercials and industrial
areas. A collector may penetrate residential
neighborhoods and distribute trips from the arterials
through the area to the ultimate destination. A
collector gathers traffic from local neighborhoods and
channels it into the arterial system. Within the
Anderson Transportation Network, a collector has the
following characteristics: (1) it is one mile in length or
less; (2) it connects two arterials or an arterials and a
major traffic generator; and (3) it can be customized
according to its intended use.
(2) EXPRESSWAY. Expressways provide
the same rapid movement of large traffic volumes with
a minimal number of intersection turning conflicts.
An expressway does not provide direct access to

access facility.”
(3) INTERSTATE. Interstate highways
provide for the expeditious movement of large
volumes of through traffic between areas and/or

abutting land. An interstate has complete separation
of conflicting traffic flows.

provide direct access to abutting land and access to
higher order systems. It offers the lowest level of
mobility and usually does not contain bus routes.
Service to through traffic movement usually is
deliberately discouraged.

arterials provide for the majority of trips entering and
leaving the area and serves the major centers of
activity on the highest traffic volume corridors. It
carries the intra-urban as well as the inter-city bus
routes. For primary arterials, the concept of service to
abutting land should be subordinate to the provision of
travel service to major traffic movements.
(6) SECONDARY ARTERIAL. Secondary
arterials provide for interconnection with primary
arterials and service to trips of moderate trip length a
lower level of travel mobility than primary arterials.
The secondary arterial street places more emphasis on
land access than the higher system. These may carry
local bus routes and provide intra-community
continuity throughout the area.

(Ord. 15-11, passed 4-14-11)
DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
§ 160.25 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
(A) The city is classified and divided into 16
districts designated as follows:
Rl Residence District
R2 Residence District
R3 Residence District
R4 Residence District
Bl Local Business District
B2 General Business District
B3 Neighborhood Shopping Center
District
B4 Community Shopping Center
District
B5 Office Zone District
B6 Business Arterial Zone District
Il Industrial District
I2 Industrial District
I3 Industrial Reserved District
FW Floodway District
FF Floodway Fringe District
TND Traditional Neighborhood District
(B) The districts identified above are described
as follows:
(1) Residence districts, Rl, R2, R3, and R4
are established for residential use in conformity with
the types of neighborhoods which have occurred and
are likely to develop in the areas so designated in the
zone map. The districts differ primarily with respect
to requirements of lot size, ground floor area, and the
number of families which may be housed in one
building. The specific requirements for each
residence district are shown in Figure 1 and § 160.35.
Certain nonresidential contingent uses are
automatically permitted in these districts (see Figures
7 and 8, § 160.45), and some special exceptions (see
Figure 9 and § 160.46) may be permitted in them with
the approval of the Board. A brief description of each
of the residence districts follows:
(a) Rl. This district is established for
single-family residential use in conformity with the
types of neighborhoods which have occurred and are
likely to develop in the areas as classified in the zone
map. The specific requirements for this district are
shown in Figure l. The minimum requirements for lot
size, ground floor area of dwellings, and lot width are
the largest in this district.
(b) R2. This is a single-family
dwelling district. Requirements for minimum lot size
and ground floor area of structures are considerably
less stringent than the requirements for the Rl District.
(c) R3. This district is established to
permit single-family and two-family dwellings.
Normally, the R3 District is located in areas where
many two-family dwellings have already occurred and
are acceptable to the neighborhoods so zoned.
(d) R4. The R4 District will permit
residential use without limitation as to the number of
families to be housed in a building so long as the
prescribed lot area per family can be provided. Many
multi-family dwellings and two-family dwellings occur
in the R4 District, as well as many large older homes
2012 S-9
Zoning Code 107
which would be suitable for conversion to multifamily
use.
(2) Six business districts. Bl, B2, B3, B4,
B5, and B6 are established to meet the specific
requirements for the several classes of business uses
needed to give adequate service throughout the city as
related to present and future development. Singlefamily
dwellings are permitted in all of the business
districts, except the B4 and B6 districts. Two-family
and multi-family dwellings are permitted in the Bl and
B2 Districts. All residential uses permitted in the
business districts are subject to the requirements of
Figure 1 and § 160.35. The specific requirements for
business uses in these districts are given in Figures 2,
3, and 4, and § 160.36. For contingent uses permitted
in the business districts see Figures 7 and 8, and for
special exceptions see Figure 9 and § 160.46. A brief
description of the business districts follows:
(a) Bl. This district is designed and
located in neighborhoods to accommodate the primary
shopping and service needs of the locality. Although
limited in area occupied, Bl Districts are important to
the economic welfare of the community in placing
convenience and impulse goods shops close to the
consumer. The local business uses defined in § 160.36
are permitted in all business districts.
(b) B2. This is a general business
district providing for all types of business and service
uses including warehouse and storage facilities as well
as some light industrial operations.
(c) B3. This district is designed to
encourage development of planned neighborhood
shopping centers at convenient locations within areas
specifically zoned in the B3 District. See § 160.37,
Figure 9, and § 160.46 for requirements.
(d) B4. This district is provided to
meet the need for retail shopping facilities in planned
shopping centers in the sections of the city where no
clear pattern of business use now exists. It is
proposed that each such business center be established
on a single, well-planned site of at least five acres in
area to accommodate the shopping needs of a
community. No specific parcel of property is
designated for this purpose in the zone map but one
shopping center may be established within 1400 feet
of a B4 symbol shown in the zone map. See
§ 160.37, Figure 9, and § 160.46 for requirements,
also see § 150.16.
(e) B5. This district is provided to
meet the need for professional, business, charitable,
and nonprofit activities in districts where other
business activities should be excluded. Such offices
are proposed to provide, primarily, services as
distinguished from goods and wares and generally any
professional or business activity engaging principally
in the sale or provision of services shall be permitted
and any professional business or commercial activity
engaged principally in the sale of goods, wares, or
merchandise shall be excluded. The sale of goods,
wares, or merchandise by reference to catalogs or
other similar materials providing for delivery of the
merchandise at some place other than the place of sale
shall also be excluded.
(f) B6. This district provides for local
business uses, including retail and service nature
business uses. See § 160.38, Figure 9 and § 160.46
for requirements.
(3) Three industrial districts. Il, I2, and I3
are established to meet the present and future needs of
the city for industrial development. Residential use
will be permitted in the Il and I3 Districts, but is
excluded from the I2 District, business uses will be
excluded from the I2 and I3 Districts. Where
permitted, residential and business uses will conform
to the requirements set forth for them in Figures 1, 2,
3, and 4, respectively. The specific requirements for
industrial uses in these districts are given in Figures 5
and 6 and § 160.38. For contingent uses and special
exceptions in the industrial districts see Figures 7, 8,
and 9. A brief description of the industrial districts
follows:
(a) I1. This district will incorporate
most of the existing industrial developments and
provide for their expansion. Generally the permitted
uses will include only those where all of the
108 Anderson - Land Usage
operations, including the storage of materials, are
confined within a building and the performance
characteristics are compatible with uses permitted in
neighboring districts. Residences and business are
permitted.
(b) I2. This district will incorporate
many existing industrial developments and provide for
their expansion, and will assure adequate areas for
new industrial development. Realizing the need for
industrial expansion, the I2 District does not permit
dwellings or business.
(c) I3. The I3 District is located
where excellent industrial sites occur, but which may
not be developed. Therefore, industry may be
permitted as a special exception in § 160.46, Figure 9.
See planned industrial districts. Dwellings are
permitted in the I3 District, business is not permitted.
(4) (a) Floodway District (FW). This is
the channel of a river or stream and those portions of
the floodplains adjoining the channel which are
reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge
the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any
river or stream. This district shall allow agricultural
uses and nature preserves by right along with park and
recreational uses provided they do not involve the
erection of any structure or obstruction, the opening
of any excavation or the deposition of any material or
substance. All other uses, except residential
structures, may be allowed after a permit from Natural
Resources has been issued for the same. In addition,
a special exception from the Board of Zoning Appeals
will have to be granted after the issuance of the permit
from Natural Resources and before any earth moving
commences. The key provision is the top of the
lowest floor shall be at or above the Flood Protection
Grade (FPG).
(b) Floodway Fringe District (FF).
This is the area of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway. This district shall be an overlay
classification and shall allow the following uses such
as all facilities, residential uses, business uses, and
industrial uses permitted by the other underlying
zoned districts provided that the Flood Protection
Grade is met. All manufactured/mobile homes must
have pads at or above the elevations of the regulatory
flood and must be provided with ground anchors
meeting manufactured/mobile home tie downs,
Schedule A. In addition, adequate drainage and
access for a hauler shall be provided.
(5) (a) Traditional Neighborhood District
(TND). This is an overlay district permitting uses of
the underlying zoning district except those uses which
are prohibited by this overlay district. The Traditional
Neighborhood District is characterized by

§ 160.39 INDUSTRIAL USES AND
REQUIREMENTS.
(A) For the purpose of this section the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
DECIBEL. A unit of measurement of the
intensity or loudness of sound. Sound level meters are
used to measure such intensities and are calibrated in
decibels.
FLASH POINT. The lowest temperature at
which a combustible liquid under prescribed
conditions will give off a flammable vapor which will
burn momentarily using the closed cup method.
FOOT CANDLE. A unit of illumination. It is
equivalent to the illumination at all points which are
one foot distant from a uniform source of one
candlepower.
FREE BURNING. A rate of combustion
described by a material which burns actively and
easily supports combustion.
INTENSE BURNING. A rate of combustion
described by a material that burns with a high degree
of activity and is consumed rapidly.
MODERATE BURNING. A rate of combustion
described by a material which supports combustion
and is consumed slowly as it burns.
OCTAVE BAND. A term denoting all of the
frequencies from one given frequency to a second. In
sound octave bands, the second frequency is usually
twice the first one.
Zoning Code 123
OCTAVE BAND FILTER. An electrical device
which separates the sounds in each octave band and
presents them to the sound level meter.
PARTICULATE MATTER. Finely divided
liquid or solid material which is discharged and
carried along in the air.
RESULTANT DISPLACEMENT. The
maximum amount of motion in any direction and shall
be determined by means of any three component
(simultaneous) measuring system approved by the
Commission.
RINGELMANN NUMBER. The number of the
area on the Ringelmann chart that most nearly
matches the light-obscuring capacity of smoke. The
Ringelmann chart is described in the U.S. Bureau of
Mines Information Circular 6888, on which are
illustrated graduated shades of gray for use in
estimating smoke density. Smoke below the density
of Ringelmann No. 1 shall be considered no smoke or
Ringelmann No. 0.
SLOW BURNING OR INCOMBUSTIBLE.
Materials which do not in themselves constitute an
active fuel for the spread of combustion. A material
which will not ignite, nor actively support combustion
during an exposure for five minutes to a temperature
of 1,200EF.
SMOKE. Small gas borne particles resulting
from incomplete combustion, consisting
predominantly of carbon and other incombustible
material, excluding metallurgical fume and dust, and
present in sufficient quantity to be observable
independently of the presence of other solids.
SMOKE UNIT. The number obtained when the
smoke density in Ringelmann number is multiplied by
the time of emission in minutes. For the purpose of
this calculation, a Ringelmann density reading shall be
made at least once a minute during the period of
observation, each reading is then multiplied by the
time in minutes during which it is observed. The
various products are then added together to give the
total number of smoke units observed during the
entire observation period.
THREE COMPONENT MEASURING
SYSTEM. Instrumentation which can measure
earthborne vibrations in three directions, that is,
vibration occurring in a horizontal as well as a vertical
plane.
VIBRATION. Oscillatory motion transmitted
through the ground.

accessory buildings and uses, are permitted in the
districts indicated in Figure 5 in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
(1) No activity involving the storage,
utilization, or manufacture of materials or products
which decompose by detonation shall be permitted
unless specifically licensed by the Council, and then
only in the 12 District. Such activity shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules promulgated by
the State Fire Marshal and the State Administrative
Building Council. Such materials shall include, but
are not limited to, all primary explosives such as lead
azide, lead styphnate, fulminates, and tetracene, all

construction, maintenance, repair, alteration,
modification, or improvement of buildings,
equipment, or other improvements on or within the lot
line;
124 Anderson - Land Usage
(b) The operation of motor vehicles or
other facilities for the transportation of personnel,
materials, or products;
(c) Conditions beyond the control of
the user such as fire, explosion, accidents, failure or
breakdown of equipment or facilities, or emergencies;
(d) Safety or emergency warning
signals or alarms necessary for the protection of life,
limb, or property; or
(e) Processes for which there are no
known means of control shall be exempted from these
provisions. Research shall be promptly conducted to
discover methods of control leading to installation of
corrective equipment.
(3) The performance standards applicable
to the district in which an operation or facility is
located shall be used in determining the compliance or
noncompliance of any operation or facility with such
standards.
(C) A light industrial use is one which creates a
minimum amount of nuisance outside the plant, is
conducted entirely within enclosed buildings, does not
use the open area around such buildings for storage of
raw materials or manufactured products or for any
other industrial purpose other than transporting goods
between buildings, provides for enclosed loading and
unloading berths, and such use conforms to the
following performance standards.
(1) Smoke. The emission of more than ten
smoke units per hour per stack and emissions in
excess of Ringelmann No. 2 are prohibited.
However, once during any 24 hour period for soot
blowing, process purging, and fire cleaning, each
stack shall be permitted an additional ten smoke units,
during which time smoke up to and including
Ringelmann No. 3 is permitted.
(2) Particulate matter. The rate of emission
of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of
one pound per hour per acre, of which no more than
10% by weight of particles larger than 44 microns
(325 mesh) shall be allowed. Determination of the
total net rate of emission shall be made as follows:
(a) Determine the maximum emission
in pounds per hour from each source of emission and
divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thus obtaining a gross hourly emission rate per acre.
(b) Deduct from the gross rate derived
above, the appropriate correction factors for height of
stack and stack velocity as listed in Tables 1 and 11,
thus obtaining the net rate of emission in pounds per
hour per acre of each source.
(c) Add together the individual rates of
emission derived above of each source to obtain the
total net rate of emission from all sources within the
boundaries of the lot. Dust and other types of air
pollution, borne by the wind from such sources as
storage areas, yards, roads, and the like within lot
boundaries, shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate
landscaping, paving, oiling, fencing, or other
acceptable means.
(3) Odor. No activity or operation shall
permit odors to be released which shall be detectable
at the lot line.
(4) Toxic and noxious materials. The
emission of toxic and noxious materials shall not
exceed the quantities determined by the following

cubic meter, multiply this figure by 0.061, place it in
the above formula and obtain Q in pounds permitted
in four hours. If the materials is emitted from open
piles, ponds, tanks, and areas, the maximum
permitted concentration measured at a residence
district boundary line shall be 10% of the threshold
limit value C.
(5) Glare and heat. No industrial
operation, activity, or structure shall cause intense
heat in such a manner as to be a public nuisance or
hazard across lot lines. No industrial operation,
activity, or structure shall cause illumination at or
beyond any residence district boundary in excess of
0.l foot candle.
(6) Vibration. Any industrial operation or
activity which shall cause at any time and at any point
along the nearest adjacent lot line, earthborne
vibrations in excess of the limits set forth in division
(C) (7) (a) column 1 are prohibited. In addition, any
industrial operation or activity which shall cause at
any time and at any point along a residence district

excess of Ringelmann No. 2 are prohibited.
However, once during any six hour period, for soot
blowing, process purging, and fire cleaning, each
stack shall be permitted an additional ten smoke units,
during which time smoke up to and including
Ringelmann No. 3 is permitted.
(2) Particulate matter. The rate of emission
of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of
three pounds per hour per acre, of which no more

Hygiene, x is the nearest distance in thousands of feet
from the stack, vent, flue, or other discharge point to
a residence or business district boundary line ( ft. ).
1000
(c) When C is given as milligrams per
cubic meter, multiply this figure by 0.061, place it in
the above formula and obtain Q in pounds permitted in
four hours. If the materials is emitted from open
piles, ponds, tanks, and areas, the maximum permitted
concentration measured at a residence district

FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND
OBJECTIONS.
(A) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway,
and fringe limits for the studied SFHA’s within the
jurisdiction of the city shall be as delineated on the
1% annual chance flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study of Madison County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas dated June 9, 2014, and the
corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated June
9, 2014, as well as any future updates, amendments,
or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date.
(B) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway,
and fringe limits for each of the SFHA’s within the

§ 160.41 DEFINITIONS.
Definitions. Words and or phrases used in a
special sense and applicable to this chapter shall be
defined by this section. Unless specifically defined
below, words or phrases used in this section shall be
interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have
in common usage and to give this subchapter its most
reasonable application.
ACCESSORY BUILDING or STRUCTURE. A
building or structure which:
(1) This is subordinate to a primary
building or structure in area, intent, and/or purpose;
(2) Contributes to the comfort,
convenience, or necessity of occupants of the primary
building, structure, or principal use;
(3) Does not alter or change the character
of the premises;
(4) Is located on the same zoning lot as the
primary building, structure, or use;
(5) Conforms to the setback, height, bulk,
lot coverage, and other requirements of the zoning
ordinance unless otherwise provided for;
(6) May not be constructed prior to the time
of construction of the primary building or structure,
unless used for agricultural or personal storage or
otherwise specified in the zoning ordinance;
(7) Is not designed for human occupancy as
a dwelling or commercial use; and
(8) In the case of a telecommunications
tower, antenna, or other radio or cellular
communications or equipment, a subordinate structure

which is incidental and accessory to that of the
principal telecommunications tower, antenna, or other
radio or cellular communications equipment.
ADDITION. Any construction that increases the
intensity of development on a property in terms of site
coverage, floor area, volume, height, or similar
feature. More specifically, this means any walled and
roofed expansion to the perimeter of an existing
structure in which the addition is connected by a
common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any
walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a
firewall or is separated by independent perimeter
load-bearing walls, is considered under FEMA as new
construction. If it is platted and under separate
ownership then this addition would also be considered
as new construction under the zoning ordinance.
APPEAL. A request for a review of the
Floodplain Administrator's or Director's interpretation
of any provision of this subchapter. The appeal is
reviewed by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A
designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths
from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel
does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity
flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized
by ponding or sheet flow.
BASE FLOOD DEPTH. A measurement of the
base flood in feet above ground, used for shallow
flooding.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The
computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated
to rise during the base flood. This also means the
elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.
BASE FLOODPLAIN. Under riverine analysis it
is the river and or ditch channel and the land area that
includes the floodway and the area known as floodway
fringe. On NFIP maps, the base floodplain is called
the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The
designated flood zones in the SFHA are Zone A, AE,
Al-30, AO, AH, V, VE or V1-30 depending on the
amount of flood data available, the severity of the
flood hazard, or the age of the flood map.
BASEMENT. Under § 160.44 it is the area of a
building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING. A structure having a roof supported
by columns or walls, for the shelter, support,
enclosure, or protection of persons, animals, chattels,
or property. When separated by party walls, each
portion of such a building shall be considered a
separate structure. See also STRUCTURE.

having no structural connection with another building.
(2) FRONT LINE OF BUILDING. The
line of the face of the building nearest the front lot
line.
(3) HEIGHT OF BUILDING. The vertical
distance measured from the lot ground level to the
highest point of the roof for a flat roof, to the deck
line of a mansard roof, and to the mean height
between eaves and ridges for gable, hip, and gambrel
roofs.
(4) PRINCIPAL BUILDING. A building in
which is conducted the main or principal use of the lot
on which the building is situated. Where a substantial
part of an accessory building is attached to the
principal building in a substantial manner, such as by
a roof, such accessory building shall be counted as a
part of the principal building.

signed by the Development Director stating that the
occupancy and use of land or a newly constructed or
modified building or structure, referred to therein, is
completed in its entirety and complies with all
applicable regulations, zoning, building and
otherwise, and therefore may be occupied.

provide incentives for those communities in the
regular program that have gone beyond the minimum
floodplain management requirements to develop extra
measures to provide protection from flooding.
CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility that even a
slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical
facilities include, but are not limited to, schools,

servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes
are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed before the effective date of the
community's first floodplain ordinance.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR
SUBDIVISION. The preparation of additional sites by

FEMA has delineated the regulatory floodway. Recent
Flood Insurance studies show the floodway on the
FIRM and do not include and FBFM.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).
An official map of a community published by FEMA
that delineates the approximate boundary of the
floodplain, where the boundaries of the areas of

official map of a community, on which FEMA has
delineated both the Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHA’s) and the risk premium zones applicable to
the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). A report
published by FEMA for a community issued along
with the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM). This is the official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA.
FLOODPLAIN. The channel proper and the
areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse
which have been or hereafter may be covered by the
regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the
floodway and the fringe districts.
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation
of an overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in
the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency
preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
F L O O D P L A I N M A N A G E M E N T
REGULATIONS. This section and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes,
health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and
other applications of police power which control
development in flood-prone areas. This term describes
federal, state, or local regulations in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN
MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS are also referred
to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance,
flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain
management requirements.
FLOOD PRONE AREA. Any land area
acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to
inundation by water from any source.
FLOOD PROOFING (also known as DRY
FLOOD PROOFING). Protective measures added to
or incorporated in a structure that is not elevated
above the base flood elevation to prevent or minimize
flood damage. Dry-proofing measures are designed to
keep water from entering a structure.
FLOOD PROOFING CERTIFICATE. A form
used to certify compliance for nonresidential
structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a
registered professional engineer or architect.
FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG). The
elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any
given location in the Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA). Also known as the FREEBOARD.
FLOOD, REGULATORY. See REGULATORY
FLOOD.
FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or stream
and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the
channel which are reasonably required to efficiently
carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the
regulatory flood of any river or stream.
FREEBOARD. A margin of safety added to the
base flood elevation to account for waves, debris,
miscalculations or lack of data. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than those
calculated for the base flood. In Indiana that is two
feet above the BFE. Hence, this is the requirement to
elevate two feet above the Flood Fringe for an
approved improvement or new construction.
FRINGE. Those portions of the floodplain
outside the floodway. This is also known as the
FLOOD FRINGE.
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138A
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY. A
facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to
water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing
facilities. The term does not include long term
storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
HARDSHIP. A perceived difficulty with regard
to one's ability to improve land stemming from the
application of the development standards of this
section, which may or may not be subject to relief by
means of a variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals of
Anderson requires that the variance be exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere
economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. In and of themselves, self-imposed
situations and claims based on a perceived reduction
of or restriction on economic gain shall not be
considered hardships. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional
hardship. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the
property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to
a different use than originally intended.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest
natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the
start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.
HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure
individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.
HYDRODYNAMIC FORCE. The force of
moving water, including the impact of debris and high
velocities.
HYDROLOGIC CYCLE. The natural cycle that
circulates water throughout the environment to
maintain an overall balance between water in the air,
on the surface and in the ground.
HYDROLOGY. The science dealing with the
waters of the earth. A flood discharge is developed by
a hydrological study.
HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE. The pressure put
on a structure by the weight of standing water. The
deeper the water, the more it weighs and the greater
the hydrostatic pressure.
INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).
The cost to repair a substantially damaged structure
that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is
required to bring a substantially damaged structure
into compliance with the local flood damage
prevention ordinance. This is an additional claim
payment made to a flood insurance policy holder to
help cover the cost of bringing a substantially
damaged or repetitively damaged building into
compliance with community's floodplain management
ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination
thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance
policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997,
will include ICC coverage.
IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT. A
permit signed by the Planning Director stating that a
proposed improvement complies with the provisions of
the zoning code and such other ordinances as may be
applicable. Thereby, allowing a person to erect,
construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve,
remove, convert, alter the condition of the land;
change the use or occupancy of a property; or
otherwise cause any change to occur that is subject to
the requirements of this subchapter.
LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). An
amendment to the currently effective FEMA map,
issued by FEMA only, which establishes that a
property is not located in a Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA).
LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). An
official revision to the currently effective FEMA map.
It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.
2015 S-12
138B Anderson - Land Usage
LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON
FILL (LOMR-F). An official revision by letter to an

determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded
from the SFHA.
LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. The lowest
elevation, after completion of construction, of the
ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.
LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest of the following:
(1) The top of the lowest level of the
structure;
(2) The top of the basement floor;
(3) The top of the garage floor, if the
garage is the lowest level of the structure;
(4) The top of the first floor of a structure
elevated on pilings or pillars;
(5) The top of the floor level of any
enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated
structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any
resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:
(a) The walls are designed to
automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on
the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood
waters, by providing a minimum of two openings (in
addition to doorways and windows) having a total net
area of one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area. The bottom of all such openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade; and
(b) Such enclosed space shall be usable
solely for the parking of vehicles and building access.
MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure,
transportable in one or more sections, which is built
on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the
required utilities. The term MANUFACTURED
HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.
MANUFACTURED/MOBILE HOME PARK. A
parcel of land under single ownership on which two or
more mobile homes or manufactured homes are
occupied as residences.

parcel of land platted for a subdivision with the
required improvements and utilities and designed or
intended for lots to be conveyed by deed to individual
owners for residential occupancy by manufactured
homes.
MAP AMENDMENT. A change to an effective
NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA
of an individual structure or a legally described parcel
of land that has been inadvertently included in the
SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have
occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that
showed the structure or parcel to be within the
SFHA).
MAP PANEL NUMBER. The four-digit number
followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a
flood map. The first four digits represent the map
panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of
times the map panel has been revised. (The letter "A"
is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first
revision.)
MARKET VALUE. For FEMA purposes, this
means the building value, excluding the land (as
agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as
established by what the local real estate market will
bear. Market value can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by
age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted
assessed values. For all other purposes, the market
value is the site value of building(s) and land that a
willing buyer and willing seller agree upon. This too
can be established by independent certified appraisal,
current sale or adjusted assessed value.
MITIGATION. Sustained actions taken to reduce
or eliminate long term risk to people and property
from hazards and the resulting effects. The purpose of
mitigation is two fold:
(1) To protect people and structures; and

participating communities nationwide through the
cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the
private insurance industry.
NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM
(NGVD) OF 1929. As corrected in 1929, this is a
vertical control used as a reference for establishing
varying elevations within the floodplain. It was known
formerly as the "Mean Sea Level Datum of 1929
(MSL)."
NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for
which the start of construction has commenced after
the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR
SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes
are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the
community's first floodplain ordinance.
NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM OF
1988 (NAVD 88). As adopted in 1993 it is a vertical
control datum used as a reference for establishing
varying elevations within the floodplain.

includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf,
embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection,
excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert,
building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill,
structure, vegetation, or other material in, along,
across or projecting into any watercourse which may
alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or
velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the
flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
ONE-HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD (100-YEAR
FLOOD). This is the flood that has a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any
flood zone that begins with the letter “A” is subject to
the 1% annual chance flood. See REGULATORY
FLOOD.
ONE-PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD.

exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that
begins with the letter “A” is subject to the 1% annual
chance flood. See REGULATORY FLOOD.
PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY. Any
community that voluntarily elects to participate in the
NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain
management regulations that are consistent with the
standards of the NFIP.
PHYSICAL MAP REVISION (PMR). An
official republication of a community's FEMA map to
effect changes to base (1% annual chance) flood
elevations, floodplain boundary delineations,
regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These
changes typically occur as a result of structural works
or improvements, annexations resulting in additional
flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood
elevations or SFHA’s.
POST-FIRM BUILDING/CONSTRUCTION.
Construction or substantial improvement that started
on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the
community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is

measured at the largest horizontal projections;
(3) Designed to be self propelled or
permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(4) Designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational
camping, travel, or seasonal use.
REGULAR PROGRAM. Under NFIP this is the
phase of the community participation in the NFIP that
begins on the date of the FIRM or when the
community adopts an ordinance that meets the
minimum requirements of the NFIP and adopts the
technical data provided with the FIRM, whichever is
later, This means when more comprehensive
floodplain management requirements are imposed and
higher amounts of insurance are available based upon
risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.
REGULATORY FLOOD. A flood having a peak
discharge which can be equaled or exceeded on the
average of once in a 100-year period, as calculated by
a method and procedure which is acceptable to and
approved by the Indiana Natural Resources
Commission and FEMA. Further, this flood is
equivalent to a flood having a 1% probability of
occurrence in any given year. The REGULATORY
FLOOD is also known by the terms BASE FLOOD,
1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, and 100-YEAR
FLOOD.
REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood-related damages
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions
during a ten-year period ending on the date of the
event for which the second claim is made, in which
the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the
average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market
value of the structure at the time of each such flood
event.
RESPONSIBLE PARTY. For purposes of
issuing notice of violation, the following persons shall
be considered responsible parties, with liability for
fines and responsibility for remedy of the violation:
the property owner(s); persons with any possessory

owner, tenant, builder, developer, possessor of
interest, architect, designer, property manager,
equipment operator known or suspected to be
responsible in part or in whole for a violation of the
zoning ordinance.
RETENTION POND. A man-made pond which
holds water year-round and that is designed to hold
storm water from an improvement and release that
storm water up to a maximum regulated rate.
RETROFITTING. These techniques include
flood proofing, elevating, construction of small
levees, and other modifications made to an existing
building or its yard to protect it from flood damage.
RIVERINE. Of or produced by a river. These
floodplains have readily identifiable channels.
Floodway maps can only be prepared for riverine
floodplains.
RUNOFF. Under NFIP this is the rainfall and
snowmelt that reaches a ditch, stream or river.
SECTION 1316. That section of the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which
states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be
provided for any property that the Administrator finds
has been declared by a duly constituted state or local
zoning authority or other authorized public body to be
in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise
restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone
areas.
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138E
SHEET FLOW. Floodwater that spreads out over
a large area that does not have defined channels at a
somewhat uniform depth.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA).
Those lands within the jurisdictions of the city subject
to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHA’s of
the city are generally identified as such on the
Madison County and Incorporated Areas Flood
Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, dated May 3, 2011.
The SFHA’s of those parts of unincorporated Madison
County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the city or that may be annexed into the city are
generally identified as such on the Madison County
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and dated May 3, 2011. (These areas are
shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, Al-A30,
AH, AR, A99, or AO).
START OF CONSTRUCTION. Under FEMA
regulations this includes substantial improvement, and
means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means the first
placement or permanent construction of a structure
(including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footing, installation of piles,
construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading
and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT. Efforts to
reduce the impact of increased runoff that results from
new development.
STRUCTURAL FLOOD CONTROL. Measures
that control floodwaters by construction of barriers or
storage areas or by modifying or redirecting channels.
STRUCTURE. Construction that is principally
above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The
term includes a gas or liquid storage tank(s), a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The
term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed
on a site for more than 180 days.
SUBMIT TO RATE. Under NFIP it is a process
used when an insurance agent cannot complete the rate
calculation for a flood insurance policy. The
application is sent to the WYO Company or FEMA to
be individually rated.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any
origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
before the "start of construction" of the improvement.
This term includes structures which have incurred
"repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of
the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code requirements or any alteration of a "historic
structure," provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
SUSPENSION. The removal of a participating
community from the NFIP because the community has
not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in
the NFIP.
2015 S-12
138F Anderson - Land Usage
VARIANCE. A modification of the specific
requirements of the zoning code granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals (BZA) in accordance with the
terms of the zoning code for the purpose of assuring
that no property, because of special circumstances or
hardship applicable to it, shall be deprived of
privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same vicinity and district. The specific approval
granted by the BZA, in the manner prescribed by the
zoning ordinance, allows the applicant, if so granted,
to deviate from the development standards, such as
height, bulk, area, or other parameters, that the
ordinance otherwise prescribes.
VELOCITY. Under riverine definitions it is the
speed of water, a force that is measured in feet per
second.
VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other
development to be fully compliant with this
subchapter. A structure or other development without
the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of
compliance required in this section is presumed to be
in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided. Under the zoning ordinance in general it is
any building, sign, structure, development, feature,
etc. that is in non-conformance for which neither a
variance or an administrative letter of approval has
been issued granting authority to be in
non-conformance.
WATERCOURSE. A lake, river, creek, stream,
wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over
which waters flow at least periodically.
WATERCOURSE includes specifically designated
areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
WATERSHED. Under riverine definitions this is
a geographical area that drains into a lake, stream or
other body of water.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height,
in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of
1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical
Datum of 1929 (NGVD) (other datum where
specified) of floods of various magnitudes and
frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
ZONE (FLOOD HAZARD ZONE). A
geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that
reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
Reference to a flood hazard zone as defined as
follows;
(1) ZONE A.
(a) Zone A. Areas subject to
inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are
shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
(b) Zone A1 - A30. Areas which are
subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event determined by detailed methods. Base flood
elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone
AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones
A1-A30.) Area where the FIRM shows a base flood
elevation in relation to NGVD.
(c) Zone AE. Special Flood Hazard
Area where base flood elevations are provided.
(d) Zone AO. Areas subject to
inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet. Average flood
depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply.
(e) Zone AH. Areas subject to
inundation by 1% annual chance shallow flooding
(usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths
derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown
within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply. Base flood elevations in relation
to NGVD are provided.
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138G
(f) Zone AR. Areas that result from
the decertification of a previously accredited flood
protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood
protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
(g) Zone A99. Areas subject to
inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event, but
which will ultimately be protected upon completion of
an under-construction Federal flood protection system.
These are areas of special flood hazard where enough
progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes.
Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection
system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are
shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
(2) Zone B. Area of moderate flood hazard,
usually depicted on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as
between the limits of the base and 500-year floods. B
Zones may have flooding that does not meet the
criteria to be mapped as a Special Flood Hazard Area,
especially ponding and local drainage problems.
(3) Zone C. Area of minimal flood hazard,
usually depicted on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as
above the 500-year flood level. B and C Zones may
have flooding that does not meet the criteria to be
mapped as a Special Flood Hazard Area, especially
ponding and local drainage problems.
(4) Zone D. Area of undetermined but
possible flood hazard.
(5) Zone X. The area where the flood
hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones
shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with
a 0.2% chance of being equaled or exceeded (the
500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older
FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance
probability of flooding is less than 0.2%.
ZONING ADMINISTRATOR. An enforcement
officer for the city. The enforcement officer is
responsible for enforcing the zoning ordinances. The
Zoning Administrator's position and rank is within the
Department of Municipal Development.
(Ord. 14-11, passed 4-14-11)
§ 160.42 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(A) Lands to which this subchapter applies. This
subchapter shall apply to all SFHA’s and known flood
prone areas within the jurisdiction of the city.
(B) Basis for establishing regulatory flood data.
This subchapter’s protection standard is the regulatory
flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed
below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party submitting the detailed
engineering study needs to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources for review and approval.
(1) The regulatory flood elevation,
floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHA’s of
the city shall be as delineated on the 1% annual
chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
Madison County and Incorporated Areas dated May 3,
2011 and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate
Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and dated May 3, 2011.
(2) The regulatory flood elevation,
floodway, and fringe limits for the SFHA’s of
Anderson delineated as an "A Zone" on the FIRM of
Madison County and Incorporated Areas prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
dated May 3, 2011, shall be according to the best data
available as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square
mile.
(3) In the absence of a published FEMA
map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map,
the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe
limits of any watercourse in the community's known
2015 S-12
138H Anderson - Land Usage
flood prone areas shall be according to the best data
available as provided by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square
mile.
(C) Establishment of floodplain development
permit. A floodplain development permit shall be
required in conformance with the provisions of this
subchapter prior to the commencement of any
development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
(D) Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted or structurally altered
within the SFHA without full compliance with the
terms of this subchapter and other applicable
regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall
hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
(E) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This
subchapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this subchapter and
another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the
more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(F) Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and
actual ground elevations.
(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy
between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM
and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.
(2) If the elevation of the site in question is
below the base flood elevation, that site shall be
included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the
site in question is above the base flood elevation, that
site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the
floodplain regulations will not be applied. The
property owner should be advised to apply for a
LOMA.
(G) Interpretation. In the interpretation and
application of this subchapter all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the
governing body; and
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any
other powers granted under state statutes.
(H) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The
degree of flood protection required by this subchapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Therefore, this subchapter does not create any liability
on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this
subchapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully there under.
(I) Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a
Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or
failure to comply with the requirements of a
Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a
variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this
subchapter. All violations shall be considered a
common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of the zoning
ordinance for the city. All violations shall be enforced
according to the Enforcement and Penalty procedures
of the zoning ordinance of the city.
(J) Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC). In
order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment
under ICC coverage as a "repetitive loss structure",
the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the
building be covered by a contract for flood insurance
and incur flood-related damages on two occasions
during a ten-year period ending on the date of the
event for which the second claim is made, in which
the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the
average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market
value of the building at the time of each such flood
event.

§ 160.43 ADMINISTRATION.
(A) Designation of Administrator. The Plan
Commission for the city, which is organized under
I.C. 36-7-4-207 and local Ordinance 46-85, designates
that the Municipal Development Director, also known
as the Planning Director, the Deputy Director and or
any of their designees shall administer and implement
the provisions of this subchapter and be referred to as
the Floodplain Administrators.
(B) Permit procedures. Application for a
Floodplain Development Permit shall be made to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him
or her prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following plans in
duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question;
existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of
materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the
location of the foregoing. Specifically the following
information is required:
(1) Application stage.
(a) A description of the proposed
development;
(b) Location of the proposed
development sufficient to accurately locate property
and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;
(c) A legal description of the property
site;
(d) A site development plan showing
existing and proposed development locations and
existing and proposed land grades;
(e) Elevation of the top of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings.
Elevation should be in NAVD 88 or NGVD;
(f) Elevation (in NAVD 88 or
NGVD) to which any nonresidential structure will be
flood-proofed;
(g) Description of the extent to which
any watercourse will be altered or related as a result
of proposed development; and
(2) Construction stage. Upon placement of
the lowest floor; or flood-proofing, it shall be the duty
of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a certification of the NAVD 88 or
NGVD elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed
elevation, as built. Said certification shall be prepared
by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the
same. When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular
structure said certification shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a professional engineer
or architect and certified by same. Any work
undertaken prior to submission of the certification
shall be at the permit holder’s risk. (The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor and
flood-proofing elevation survey data submitted.) The
permit holder shall correct deficiencies detected by
such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to
make said corrections required hereby shall be cause
to issue a stop-work order for the project.
(C) Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain
Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator and/or
designated staff is hereby authorized and directed to
enforce the provisions of this section. The
Administrator is further authorized to render
interpretations of this subchapter, which are consistent
with its spirit and purpose. Duties and responsibilities
of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not
be limited to:
(1) Review all floodplain development
permits to assure that the permit requirements of this
section have been satisfied;
(2) Inspect and inventory damaged
structures in SFHA and complete substantial damage
determinations;

relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such
notifications to FEMA;
(6) Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request local permit documents, damaged
structure inventories, substantial damage
determinations, regulatory flood data, SFHA maps,
Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letters of Map
Revision (LOMR), copies of DNR permits and
floodplain analysis and regulatory assessments (letters
of recommendation), federal permit documents, and
"as-built" elevation and flood-proofing data for all
buildings constructed subject to this subchapter.
(7) Utilize and enforce all Letters of Map
Revision (LOMR) or Physical Map Revisions (PMR)
issued by FEMA for the currently effective SFHA
maps of the community.
(8) Assure that maintenance is provided
within the altered or relocated portion of said

This building protection requirement applies to the
following situations:
(a) Construction or placement of any
new structure having a floor area greater than 400
square feet; and
(b) Addition or improvement made to
any existing structure:
1. Where the cost of the addition
or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the value of
the existing structure (excluding the value of the land);
2. With a previous addition or
improvement constructed since the community's first
floodplain ordinance.
(c) Reconstruction or repairs made to
a damaged structure where the costs of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition equals or

138L Anderson - Land Usage
(2) Residential construction. New
construction or substantial improvement of any
residential structure (or manufactured home) shall
have the lowest floor; including basement, at or above
the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation).
Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with the standards of division
(B)(4).
(3) Non-residential construction. New
construction or substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the FPG
(two feet above the base flood elevation) or be
flood-proofed to or above the FPG. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with the standards of division
(B)(4). Structures located in all "A Zones" may be
flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated if done in
accordance with the following:
(a) A registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the structure has been
designed so that below the FPG, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The
structure design shall take into account flood
velocities, duration, rates of rise, hydrostatic
pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set
forth in § 160.43(C)(10).
(b) Flood-proofing measures shall be
operable without human intervention and without an
outside source of electricity.
(4) Elevated structures. New construction
or substantial improvements of elevated structures
shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed
by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood
protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and
exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs
must meet the following minimum criteria:
(a) Provide a minimum of two
openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every one square foot of enclosed
area;
(b) All openings shall be located
entirely below the BFE; and
(c) The bottom of all openings shall be
no more than one foot above the exterior grade or the
interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher;
(d) Openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices
provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions;
(e) Access to the enclosed area shall
be the minimum necessary to allow for parking for
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living
area (stairway or elevator);
(f) The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into
separate rooms;
(g) The interior grade of such enclosed
area shall be at an elevation at or higher than the
exterior grade; and
(h) An adequate drainage system must
be installed to remove floodwaters from the interior
area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period of
time after a flood event.
(5) Structures constructed on fill. A
residential or nonresidential structure may be
constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance
with the following:
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138M
(a) The fill shall be placed in layers no
greater than one foot deep before compacting to 95%
of the maximum density obtainable with the either the
Standard or Modified Proctor Test method.
(b) The fill should extend at least ten
feet beyond the foundation of the structure before
sloping below the FPG.
(c) The fill shall be protected against
erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover,
riprap, or bulk-heading. If vegetative cover is used,
the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to
one vertical.
(d) The fill shall not adversely affect
the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring
properties.
(e) The top of the lowest floor
including basements shall be at or above the FPG.
(f) All fills are subject to the zoning
ordinance requirement of prior approval by the Board
of Zoning Appeals for a Special Exception for a
land/soil excavation "Fill Use."
(6) Standards for manufactured homes and
recreational vehicles. Manufactured homes and
recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet
one of the following requirements:
(a) The manufactured home shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to
be placed on a site;
1. Outside a manufactured home
park or subdivision;
2. In a new manufactured home
park or subdivision;
3. In an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or
4. In an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision on which a manufactured
home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of
a flood.
(b) The manufactured home shall be
elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in
height above grade and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be
placed on a site in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision that has not been substantially
damaged by a flood.
(c) Manufactured homes with fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall
be designed to preclude finished living space and
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls as required for elevated structures in
division (B)(4).
(d) Flexible skirting and rigid skirting
not attached to the frame or foundation of a
manufactured home are not required to have openings.
(e) Recreational vehicles placed on a
site shall either:
1. Be on site for less than 180
days; and
2. Be fully licensed and ready for
highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions); or
3. Meet the requirements for
"manufactured homes" as stated earlier in this section.
(C) Standards for subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
2015 S-12
138N Anderson - Land Usage
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed
to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards;
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be
provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed
development (including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50
lots or five acres;
(5) All subdivision proposals shall minimize
development in the SFHA and/or limit density of
development permitted in the SFHA; and
(6) All subdivision proposals shall ensure
safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and
vehicles (especially emergency responders).
(D) Critical facility. Construction of new critical
facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located
outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA
if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical
facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Flood-proofing and sealing measures must be taken to
ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by
or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to
or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.
(E) (1) Standards for identified floodways.
Located within SFHA’s, established in § 160.42(B),
are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified
floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require
the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and apply for a
permit for construction in a floodway. Under the
provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for construction in
a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local
building permit for any excavation, deposit,
construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities
such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc.
undertaken before the actual start of construction of
the structure. However, it does exclude
non-substantial additions/improvements to existing
(lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway.
(I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of
non-substantial additions/ improvements to residences
in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a
permit for construction in the floodway from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note
that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the
existing grade, prior approval (construction in a
floodway permit) for the fill is required from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
(2) No action shall be taken by the
Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when
applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the
Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the
provisions contained in this section have been met.
The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a
floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. However, a community's more restrictive
regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
(3) No development shall be allowed which
acting alone or in combination with existing or future
development, will increase the regulatory flood more
than 0.14 of one foot; and for all projects involving
channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city
shall submit the data and request that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory
flood data.
(F) Standards for identified fringe. If the site is
located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit provided the provisions
contained in this section have been met.
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138O
The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of
any new or substantially improved structure shall be
at or above the FPG.
(G) Standards for SFHA’s without established
base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes.
(1) Drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile:
(a) If the site is in an identified
floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined, and the drainage area
upstream of the site is greater than one square mile,
the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources for review and
comment;
(b) No action shall be taken by the
Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for
construction in a floodway or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1% annual
chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood
Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources;
(c) Once the Floodplain Administrator
has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
approving the proposed development, a Floodplain
Development Permit may be issued provided the
conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are
not less restrictive than the conditions received from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the
provisions contained in this section have been met.
(2) Drainage area upstream of the site is
less than one square mile:
(a) If the site is in an identified
floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined and the drainage area
upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to
provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of
the floodplain and 1% annual chance flood elevation
for the site.
(b) Upon receipt, the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions
contained in this section have been met.
(3) The total cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and
will not increase flood damages or potential flood
damages.
(H) Standards for flood-prone areas. All
development in known flood prone areas not identified
on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map
is available, shall meet general standards as required
per divisions (A)(1) - (10).
(I) Variance procedures.
(1) Designation of variance and Appeals
Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals, also known as
the BZA, as established by I.C. 36-7-4-901 et seq.
and local Ordinance 2439 of the city shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from
requirements of this section.
(2) Duties of the Board of Zoning Appeals
(BZA). The BZA shall hear and decide appeals when
it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator
in the enforcement or administration of this section.
An aggrieved person by a decision of the BZA may
file with the circuit or superior court of Madison
County a verified petition setting forth that the
decision is illegal in whole or in part and specifying
the grounds of the illegality. The aggrieved person has
30 days after the date of the decision of the BZA in
which to file the petition with the appropriate court.
(3) Variance procedures. In consideration
for approval for petitions for variance from the Flood
Regulations, the BZA shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and
(a) The danger of life and property
due to flooding or erosion damage;
2015 S-12
138P Anderson - Land Usage
(b) The susceptibility of the proposed
facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner;
(c) The importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(d) The necessity to the facility of a
waterfront location, where applicable;
(e) The availability of alternative
locations for the proposed use which are not subject to
flooding or erosion damage;
(f) The compatibility of the proposed
use with existing and anticipated development;
(g) The relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
(h) The safety of access to the property
in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(i) The expected height, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the
floodwaters at the site; and
(j) The costs of providing
governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(4) Conditions for variances.
(a) Variances shall only be issued
when there is:
1. A showing of good and
sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship; and
3. A determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing laws or ordinances.
(b) No variance for a residential use
within a floodway subject to divisions (E) or (G)(1)
may be granted.
(c) Any variance granted in a
floodway subject to divisions (E) or (G)(1) will
require a permit from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources.
(d) Variances to the provisions for
flood hazard reduction of division (B) may be granted
only when a new structure is to be located on a lot of
one half acre or less in size, contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the flood protection grade.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon
a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
(f) Variances may be granted for the
reconstruction or restoration of any structure
individually listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.
(g) Any petition to which a variance is
granted shall be given written notice specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and
stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(h) The Floodplain Administrator shall
maintain the records of appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources upon request.
(5) Variance notification. Any applicant to
whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
2015 S-12
Zoning Code 138Q
(a) The issuance of a variance to
construct a structure below the base flood elevation
will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property. The
Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and report such variances issued in the
community's biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(6) Historic structure. Variances may be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic
structures" upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an "historic
structure" and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(7) Special conditions. Upon the
consideration of the factors listed in this section, and
the purposes of this chapter, the BZA may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

§ 162.02 MATERIAL.
Backfill material shall be finely broken rubble,
engineered fill, bank-run gravel, or well-graded
clean compactable earth as may be approved by the
Building Commissioner. It is specifically required
that the material to be used for backfill be approved
by the Building Commissioner prior to placement.
Fill material under all conditions shall be free of
debris, perishable or combustible material, sod,
vegetation, roots, frozen earth, or stones larger than
six inches in maximum dimension.
(Ord. 70-88, passed 10-24-88; Am. Ord. 45-05,
passed 6-9-05)
§ 162.03 PLACEMENT OF FILL AND
GRADING.
(A) Fill shall be placed to a grade level with, and
conforming generally to, the respective surface levels
of the sidewalk, alley, and lots immediately adjacent
to the basements or basement. Fill shall be placed into
the basement in approximately one foot lifts and
167
2006 S-3
168 Anderson - Land Usage
spread by means of mechanical equipment to obtain
the maximum amount of compaction. It will be
required that the equipment distribute the fill and
make four passes over all fill placed for each
successive layer. Care shall be taken in placing the
fill to prevent the formulation of large voids, so as
to avoid undue settlement after fill has been placed.
The contractor must compact all fill areas to achieve
a buildable site.
(B) The contractor shall notify the Building
Commissioner when the backfill of any site is
scheduled and obtain prior approval of the backfill
material which has been stockpiled adjacent to the
site.
(C) Rubble as defined in the preceding chapter
shall be well distributed with the earth and other fine
material with interstices filled, and shall not be
placed within two feet of the finished grade. Under
all conditions clean earth fill will be required for the
top two feet of backfill area. Fill shall be compacted
at an optimum moisture content so as to obtain the
maximum amount of compaction, and moisture
should be added during the backfilling operation if
necessary. The contractor or person or persons
performing the grading shall finish grade the site to
provide a clean, safe condition, free from ponding
to permit the future mowing of grass on the site.
(D) The six inches of final fill for finish grade
shall be what is considered to be topsoil. After final
inspection of final grading, the contractor shall seed
graded areas. Grass seed shall be applied at a rate
specified by supplier for full coverage. A mixture
of at least 50% Kentucky Bluegrass and 50%
Annual Rye or any premium, pre-mixed bulk seed
shall be used. The area of grading shall also be
strawed. This step may be exempt upon written
approval of the Building Commissioner.
(E) The contractor shall exercise proper
precautions at all times for the protection of persons
or property and shall be responsible for all damages
to
persons or property, either on or off the work site,
which occur as a result of permitted demolition
activities. The contractor shall take or cause to be
taken any safety steps or health measures as the
Building Commissioner determines to be reasonable.
Some steps may include safety barriers, silt fencing,
applying water to the structure during demolition,
providing for monitoring personnel acceptable to the
Fire Department to be on site during demolition
activities at the owner or operator’s expense, etc.
Buried tank removal shall comply with all
requirements of this code as found in Chapter 93.
(F) A final inspection will be required upon
completion of the work, and all work must be
completed within 30 days after the issuance of the
permit.
