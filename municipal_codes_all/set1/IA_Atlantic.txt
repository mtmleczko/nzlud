46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
46.04 Minors in Billiard Rooms
46.01 CURFEW. The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility through an objective test.

D. “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area, such as a lobby, office or interrogation room which is not designed, set aside or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
E. “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
CHAPTER 46 MINORS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
F. “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a minor.
2. Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and amusement in the City between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 5:00 p.m. of any day.

D. The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
E. The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4. Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence falls within one of the above exceptions.
5. Enforcement Procedures.
A. Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
CHAPTER 46 MINORS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age.
B. Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
C. Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such time as the court may direct.
D. Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person who is known to the child.
6. Penalties.
A. Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail or personal delivery, send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable penalties.
B. Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal infraction.
C. Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
D. Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a municipal infraction.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES. Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in accordance with State law.

In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples).
97.09 SEPTIC DISPOSAL. The City may accept septic waste from individuals and/or businesses when approved by the Superintendent. The location for discharge, procedures, times, and acceptable waste accepted into the City system will be designated by the Superintendent and posted at City Hall and the Wastewater Treatment Facility. Individuals or companies desiring to discharge septic waste into the City collection system must first obtain a discharge permit. Permits are available at City Hall between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. A discharge fee associated with the permit must be paid at time of application based upon the estimated volume of the discharge. If the amount appears to be more, as determined by the wastewater employee at the time of discharge, the difference in cost will have to be paid to City Hall after the discharge. Persons receiving permits will receive a copy of the current fee schedules and guidelines for discharge at the time of application.

100.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Storm Water Management Utility, to authorize charges for the use of, and discharge to, the storm and surface water drainage systems of the City, to provide a process for appeals of certain decisions by the Council relating to such charges, and to provide for collection of delinquent charges. The Council finds that the construction, operation and maintenance of the City’s storm water system should be funded through user charges imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water to the storm water drainage system, thereby charging those persons and activities using or receiving service from that system. The City may be required to provide increased quantity or quality controls to mitigate those impacts of pollutants from discharging storm and surface waters into the storm water system. Therefore, it is appropriate to impose a storm and surface water user charge upon all users of property which may discharge, directly or indirectly into the storm water system.

100.12 CHARGES FOR MEASURED USES. Properties that are not covered in Sections 100.05 through 100.11 above shall be measured uses. For such uses, the impervious surfaces of the property, as defined by rule, shall be measured. The area shall be estimated using one or more of the following: aerial photographs, assessment records, building permits, construction plans, site visits, ad valorem property tax records, storm and surface water system connection permits, field surveys or other sources deemed reliable by the City. The storm water management charge for measured uses shall be the impervious surface area of the property divided by 4,000 square feet multiplied by the ESU rate. In lieu of determining the impervious surface area of the measured use, the Director may determine the storm water management charge by dividing the gross parcel size of the property by 0.5. The whole number of the dividend shall then be multiplied by any applicable factor for the parcel determined in Sections 100.05 through 100.11 above, and then multiplied by the ESU rate.
100.13 SEASONAL IMPERVIOUS AREA. Properties which have areas that are impervious for only a portion of the year shall constitute seasonal impervious areas; for example, a greenhouse that is covered six months, and open with a pervious floor for six months. If an impervious area is in place for more than one month per year, it shall be included in the impervious area measurement, unless exempted under the policy for “Spreading of Runoff to Pervious Surfaces.”
100.14 EXCLUSION FROM IMPERVIOUS SURFACE MEASUREMENT.
1. Roads. Public roads shall not be included in the measurement of impervious surfaces. All private roads are to be included in the measurement of impervious surface areas, except private roads that serve flat rate uses. Private roads are defined as all roads and driveways which have not been dedicated to the public and accepted for public use, and which are defined as an impervious surface under other City rules.
2. Determination of Impervious Surfaces – Roadways. All roadways, whether dirt, gravel, or paved, shall be considered impervious, and unless a part of an exempted category of road, or a part of a flat rate use, shall be included in the impervious area measurement. A “roadway” is defined as an area intended for the
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
purpose of providing access for motor vehicles. Roadways shall include such things as roads, streets, alleys and driveways.
3. Determination of Impervious Surfaces – Parking and Storage Areas.
A. All parking and storage areas, whether dirt, gravel or paved, shall be deemed impervious. A parking area is defined as an area where motor vehicles are parked temporarily. This includes such areas as public and private parking lots (regardless of frequency of use) and storage areas.
B. A dirt or gravel area that is not accessed by motor vehicles, or is not otherwise highly compacted, shall be considered pervious. This includes such uses as landscaping, and gravel or dirt areas accessed only by foot traffic or small vehicles, as defined above.
C. A user may submit information for City review showing that the conditions of subsection 2 above are valid. The City shall review such information and may perform a site inspection. If, based upon objective, verifiable information presented, or upon the site inspection performed, the City may modify the ESUs for the property to conform to the actual impervious surface. Failure to permit the City to perform a site inspection of the property shall be grounds to deny an application for review under this subsection.
4. Spreading of Runoff to Pervious Surfaces. Impervious areas shall be excluded from measurement and charge if the runoff is spread to a pervious area that does not otherwise receive rainfall. For properties which meet the criteria of this subsection, all or part of the impervious area may be excluded from measurement and charge, as appropriate. For such property, the following criteria shall apply:
A. It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide documentation as required by the City to demonstrate that the criteria are met.
B. The area of impervious area that can be exempted is limited to the area of the pervious area where the runoff is effectively spread.
C. To qualify, the runoff from an impervious area must not be concentrated but must remain as “sheet flow,” or be spread so it is in sheet flow; the runoff must pass through the pervious area before it is collected in a drain or channel system and carried away; and there cannot be any barriers such as a concrete foundation preventing the sheet flow runoff from passing through the impervious area.
5. Quarry Property. Permanent roadways, parking areas, and structures shall be included in the impervious area measurement. The actual excavated area from which material is being taken, and the temporary service roads in the excavation area shall be excluded as not being impervious.
6. Railroad Facilities. Railroad facilities shall be included in the measurement of impervious area, but the rail grade itself shall be excluded as being pervious.
100.15 EXEMPTION FROM STORM WATER MANAGEMENT CHARGE.
1. Users of properties for which all storm water is disposed of on-site, as defined by City standards, may request an exemption from storm water management
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
system charges. No partial exemptions for disposal of only a portion of the storm and surface waters on-site shall be allowed. In order to qualify for a utility charge exemption, the user must design, construct and maintain an on-site facility that keeps all storm and surface water for the full range of storms during the year. This applicant for exemption must pay an initial inspection/review fee. For the purpose of this section, the term “property” means a parcel of land, or a group of adjacent parcels working in cooperation. The term “on-site disposal” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near vicinity of the parcel requesting the exemption. In order to qualify for the exemption, the on-site system must encompass the entire property (except for incidental impervious areas as defined below), must be completely separated from the public system, and must provide adequate on-site disposal. Incidental areas such as sidewalks, decks, and driveway aprons, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total impervious area. On-site disposal facilities that may qualify are dry wells, injection wells, retention basins with percolation/evaporation capacity, and retention basins with capacity large enough to accommodate the total of all storms through the year. Many of these may have a possible adverse effect on ground water, and some techniques may require approval of State, Federal and local agencies.
2. To qualify, an applicant must submit a request to the City for a waiver of utility charges relating to the property. This request shall include a certification from an engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the City, that shows the system is separate and will dispose of the full range and volume of storm water through the year on-site. The applicant shall also submit a maintenance plan for assuring the system will function as designed. The application must be signed by the property owner. An inspection/review fee shall be paid at the time of application. If the application is denied, the inspection/review fee will be credited to the utility charges due. If the request for the waiver is made as part of the construction plans, this fee shall be waived. A decision denying an exemption may be appealed following the procedures in Section 100.20 of this chapter. If approved, the waiver will be effective for the next billing cycle.
3. The City retains the right to inspect the on-site measures to assure they are functioning as designed. If at any time the measures are found to not be effective, the exemption shall cease.
100.16 CREDITS FOR WATER QUANTITY PORTION OF THE STORM WATER UTILITY. New developments that provide on-site retention, disposal, or detention, or provide off-site conveyance system enlargements are entitled to a credit in storm water management system charges. To be eligible, new development, or portions of new development, must include design and construction of a facility that meets one of the following standards:
1. The retention facility sized to accommodate the full volume of storm water through the year with no overflow or release into the storm water management system. Eligible facilities shall be exempt from storm water management system charges.
2. A disposal facility which keeps all storm and surface water separated from the public system, and disposes of it on-site for the full range of storms during the year, including the winter, through on-site disposal (dry wells, injection wells,
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
percolation/evaporation basins). Eligible facilities shall be exempt from storm water management system charges.
3. A detention facility which meets or exceeds the standards defined in City rules for on-site storm water detention facilities. Eligible facilities shall be entitled to a reduction of one-half (½) of the actual number of ESUs calculated.
4. Upsizing of the downstream conveyance system. Credit shall be determined by the City on a case-by-case basis.
The term “on-site” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near vicinity of that for which the credit or reduction is requested. To be eligible for a credit (reduction) of storm water management system charges, the request must be submitted prior to, or as part of, the development process, but in all cases the request must be made prior to the payment of the storm water management system charges. To be eligible for a credit, the request can be made at any time, in accordance with this chapter. The request shall demonstrate the property meets one of the above conditions. For on-site facilities, the City reserves the right to inspect the facilities installed at any time. If it is found that the system no longer functions, then the storm water management system charges that were waived will become due and payable.
100.17 BILLING.
1. The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every parcel owner in the City. Mailing to the owner of record as shown in the County Assessor’s records shall satisfy this requirement. The billing period shall be semiannual. Billing statements will be sent on or about August 1 and February 1 of the year.
2. The recipient has 15 days from the billing date to file a notice of non-occupancy. The notice shall indicate the relationship of the recipient to the property (e.g., owner, lessor, mortgagee, contract holder), whether on the imposition date the property was occupied, and if so, by whom.
3. Upon receipt of the notice, the City shall determine who is obligated for payment. Based on this determination, the City shall:
A. Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by someone other than the original recipient;
B. Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that that person was the occupant;
C. Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not occupied.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to it, including utility or water district records.
4. Failure to file the notice such that it is actually received by the City within the thirty (30) days of the mailing date of the bill shall conclusively establish that the original addressee was the user on the imposition date.
5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person may agree in writing to be responsible for payment of the charge. Upon filing of such a writing with the City, subsequent bills shall be sent to that person, and that person shall be deemed to be the user.
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
6. It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false information to the City regarding any fact related to billing of a storm water utility service charge or other charge of the City.
100.18 DELINQUENCY, COLLECTION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
1. Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when not paid in full within forty-five (45) days from the date the billing statement were mailed by the City.
2. It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to discharge wastewater into the City’s storm water management system. It is also unlawful and a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection to or use the City’s storm water management system without paying the appropriate charges and fees established in this section or any rule adopted pursuant hereto. Even if no billing is received, such charges shall be due and owing and the user is obligated to pay any charges in a timely fashion.
3. Delinquent charges may be collected pursuant to the same procedure as with delinquent sanitary sewer bills by the City, with the assistance of City legal counsel, without further action or authorization by the Council.
4. In addition to remedies provided for collection of a debt, the City may seek a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting continued occupancy of premises, requiring disconnection of the premises from the public storm water utility system, and termination of water and sewer service to the user’s premises.
5. The Council may prescribe, by resolution and order, a schedule of interest and penalty charges to be imposed upon delinquent charges.
6. In a collection action under this chapter, the City shall be entitled to its costs and reasonable attorney fees, including at trial and on appeal, if it is the prevailing party.
7. In addition to the right of the City to bring a civil action to collect any delinquent charges or enforce any provision of the chapter, the City may take any of the following actions to secure payment:
A. The City may refuse to issue any permit to any person who is delinquent in any payment due under this chapter.
B. The City may terminate provision of storm and surface water service to premises used by the user.
C. The City may terminate sanitary sewer service to premises used by the user.
Termination of service pursuant to this subsection shall be according to procedures adopted under Section 100.20. If the City terminates service as provided in this section, the cost of such disconnection shall be added to the amount of any other delinquent charges and shall be recoverable in the same manner as are such charges.
8. The owner and the tenant must comply with the same procedures as set out in Sections 99.06, 99.07, and 99.08 of this Code of Ordinances.
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
9. Where a lien against property can be imposed when the owner is liable, it shall exist from the date the bill was last brought current in the same manner as with a lien for water service.
100.19 REQUEST FOR SERVICE; DISCONNECTION FROM SERVICE; USE RECLASSIFICATION; TERMINATION OF USER CHARGES.
1. The issuance of a storm water utility system connection permit relating to impervious surface on a property or parcel shall be deemed to be a specific request for provision of storm and surface water service to that property.
2. Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect property served by the system from service and terminate further user charges by utilizing the procedure in this section.
3. Any user of the public storm water utility may remove all or part of the impervious surface on the property served by the system and apply for use reclassification by utilizing the procedure in this section.
4. A person desiring to disconnect property from the system shall make application on a form provided by the City and pay the fee established therefor. The application shall be signed by the owner of the property; shall provide evidence of demolition or removal of any impervious surface on the property, or of installation of an approved on-site storm and surface water retention or infiltration system serving the property. Such on-site system shall be designed and operated to retain or dispose of all on-site storm and surface waters generated by impervious surfaces on the property, through the full range of storm events prescribed by City rule. The Council may, by rule, adopt additional criteria and administrative procedures to provide for disconnection from storm water utility service, and suspension or termination of user charges.
5. Upon receipt of a complete application for disconnection or reclassification, and verification of information thereon, and installation of the on-site system or demolition of impervious area as provided in subsection 3 of this section, the City shall issue a permit for disconnection or reclassification. Whether performed by the City or other person, the City shall inspect the disconnection.
6. The City may inspect the on-site system at any time. If at any time the system fails to perform to the standard specified in subsection 3 above, the City shall notify the owner to correct the system. If the system is not corrected to meet on-site retention or infiltration standards within thirty (30) days of such notice, the City may treat such deficiency as a reconnection to the storm water utility system and as a specific request for storm water utility service. Service fees shall then relate back to the earliest date on which the system failed to meet applicable performance standards for on-site retention or disposal.
7. If at any time after reclassification an impervious surface is added to the property, the City shall consider such an addition as a reconnection to the storm water utility and as a specific request for storm water utility service.
100.20 ADOPTION OF RULES; INTERPRETATIONS AND APPEALS.
1. Adoption of Rules.
CHAPTER 100 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA

The acceptance of any payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount; nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable by the Grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the City.

D. Franchise Fee Increases. The City may request an increase in franchise fees at any time during the term of the franchise equal to the maximum percentage allowed by Federal law. However, such request shall be made in writing and the Grantee will not be liable for said increase until proper notice, as defined by Federal law, is given to its subscriber.

4. Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of a Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act.

However, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than nine (9) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and the City may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State law.

Any franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, except to entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without the prior written consent of the City.

Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the City, shall take control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the cable system for a period exceeding one (1) year, unless extended by the City at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, and further subject to applicable Federal, State or local law, if the City finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.
D. The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Franchising Authority in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.

1. Testing For Compliance. The Grantee shall meet or exceed all FCC minimum performance and technical standards. The City shall have the right to compel the Grantee to provide results of Grantee’s testing of the cable system. In the event that the City has evidence of noncompliance, such as subscriber complaints, the City may also perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal laws. Such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than ten (10) business days, and providing a representative of the Grantee has an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or
CHAPTER 111 CABLE TELEVISION REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA

Such logs shall be available to the City for review for two years thereafter. A “complaint” as used herein shall be a written or oral complaint from a subscriber regarding signal quality or service, but not regarding programming or rates which, in the case of oral complaints, is not resolved within the original telephone call or visit from the subscriber.
5. City Role In Complaints. Unresolved complaints concerning the system or its operation or maintenance may be directed to the City Administrator.

In the event such a complaint or grievance is received by the City, the same shall be forwarded to Grantee in writing.
B. Within five (5) business days from the receipt by the Grantee of a complaint from the City, the Grantee shall state to complainant its intentions with respect to the complaint in writing.
C. Unresolved complaints concerning the system or its operation or maintenance shall be directed to the City Administrator. The City Administrator shall forward the complaint to the Grantee or shall take the question up by correspondence with the Grantee.

The principal means for accomplishing this flexibility will be the scheduled review sessions provided for in this chapter. It is intended that such review sessions will serve as a means of cooperatively working out solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such review sessions shall be two-way processes. For example, if either party has perceived that some major problem has developed, the session shall be devoted primarily to working out solutions acceptable to both parties. The City and the Grantee shall hold scheduled review sessions on the third, sixth, and ninth anniversary dates of the effective date of the franchise agreement. All such review sessions shall be open to the public and notice thereof shall be published once, not less than four (4) days or more than twenty (20) days before each review session, as provided by law.

127.13 Nature of Revocation
127.01 PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Atlantic, Iowa, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented business within the City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
127.02 FINDINGS. Based on evidence of adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented to the City Council and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in both state and federal court cases, the City Council finds that the regulatory provisions of this chapter are within its constitutional power to enact, are designed to serve the City’s substantial interest in preventing many of the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented adult uses, is narrowly tailored to that end, and provides reasonable alternative avenues of communication for sexually explicit messages within the City.
1. Sexually oriented business lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments.
2. Employees of sexually oriented businesses, as defined in this chapter, often engage in certain types of illicit sexual behavior.
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
CHAPTER 127 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
4. Communities have suffered adverse aesthetic impacts caused by sexually oriented businesses, including sexually graphic and unsanitary litter in and around adult bookstores and other sexually oriented adult uses.
5. Person often frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex in or near the premises of such sexually oriented businesses, or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs.
6. Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and Shigella infections, chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureaplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and chancroid.
7. Men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact.
8. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
9. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent duty on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City.
10. Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.
11. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented business to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
12. The fact that an applicant for a license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
13. The general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
127.03 JURISDICTION. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all of the incorporated territory of Atlantic, Iowa.

The Administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed flood plain development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the Council.
160.13 CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO BE AS PROVIDED IN APPLICATION AND PLANS. Flood Plain Development Permits, issued on the basis of approved plans and applications, authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, building floor
CHAPTER 160 FLOOD PLAIN REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.14 VARIANCES. The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
1. Cause. Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
2. Prohibited. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
3. Required To Afford Relief. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. Notice To Applicant. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
160.15 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES SHALL BE BASED. In passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
1. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
2. The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others.
3. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
4. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
5. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
6. The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
7. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.
CHAPTER 160 FLOOD PLAIN REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
8. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
9. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for the area.
10. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
11. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
12. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
13. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
160.16 CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO VARIANCES. Upon consideration of the factors listed in Section 160.15, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
1. Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
2. Limitation of periods of use and operation.
3. Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
4. Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purposes of this chapter.
5. Floodproofing measures.
160.17 NONCONFORMING USES.
1. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
A. If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
B. Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
2. If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, except unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.
CHAPTER 160 FLOOD PLAIN REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
160.18 AMENDMENTS. The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement, change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval from the Department of Natural Resources.
160.19 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION. Violations of the provisions of this chapter, or failure to comply with any of the requirements contained herein, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any requirements thereof shall upon conviction be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation(s).
160.20 SEVERABILITY. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

These regulations are adopted in order to safeguard the best interests of the City and to assist the subdivider in coordinating development plans with the aims and purposes of the City at large.

5. Significant topographical and physical features;
6. Proposed general street, lot and utilities layout.
Such sketch plan shall be considered as submitted for informal and confidential discussion between the subdivider and the staff. Submission of a subdivision sketch plan does not constitute formal filing of a plat with the City. As far as may be practical on the basis of a sketch plan, the staff will informally advise the subdivider as promptly as possible of the extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms to the design standards of this chapter and will discuss possible plan modifications necessary to ensure conformance.
166.09 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT. The procedure for the approval of a preliminary plat is as follows:
1. Filing. Application to appear before the Commission shall be filed at least fifteen (15) days prior to the regular monthly meeting.
2. Filing Fee. The applicant may prepare a preliminary plat which shall conform to the requirements of this chapter and shall file with the Clerk an application for approval of the preliminary plat. A cash fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) plus twenty dollars ($20.00) for each lot up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) shall be required to cover City expenses in making the necessary studies for the approval of such plat. Each final plat submitted, other than the first as a part of the approved preliminary, shall require an additional seventy-five dollars ($75.00)
3. Referral of Preliminary Plat. The applicant at the time of filing with the Clerk shall provide to the City six (6) prints of the preliminary plat and six (6) copies of sheets of data accompanying the plat. If satisfactory, two (2) copies of everything shall be retained for the Commission, and two (2) copies given to the Clerk for the Council and one (1) copy for the Public Works Director and one (1) copy for the Zoning Administrator.
4. Additional Referrals. Under each of the following conditions, one (1) additional copy of every document shall be required in filing and shall be transmitted to the official referred to, with advice to the effect that any recommendations for consideration by the Commission in acting on the plat should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of filing.
A. When such land abuts a County highway, the County Highway Engineer;

CHAPTER 166 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
construction, drainage problems, etc., conformity to the Comprehensive Plan and other planning problems which may occur.
6. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be held by the Commission after the filing of the preliminary plat. This hearing shall be held if possible at the next regular meeting of the Commission, but not earlier than twenty (20) days after the filing of the preliminary plat. Notice of said hearing shall be published in the official City newspaper at least four (4) days prior to the hearing. The newspaper notice shall include an easily understood description of the area to be subdivided. The cost of the notice shall be paid by the subdivider in addition to the cash fee for other expenses. In addition, the Clerk shall notify by U.S. mail the subdivider and the record owners of the property immediately adjoining the lands within the plat not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the meeting.
7. Action by Commission. After consideration of all hearings, reports, comments and suggestions, the Commission shall, within forty (40) days after the public hearing, recommend, in writing, to the Council stating its reason therefor either that the preliminary plat be granted approval subject to certain conditions, if any, or that the preliminary plat be disapproved. A copy of the recommendations shall be sent to the Council and to the applicant with notice to the applicant of the date when it will be considered by the Council.
8. Council Action. The Council shall consider the preliminary plat at its next meeting following receipt of the Commission’s recommendations. The Council shall either approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. The Clerk shall notify the applicant in writing of the Council’s action stating the conditions of approval or reasons for disapproval of the preliminary plat. If approval is given, the Clerk shall send the applicant one (1) copy of the preliminary plat marked with any required revisions.
9. Conditional Approval. Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed to be an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat and act as an authorization and guide to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. This approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of six (6) months, unless an extension is granted by the Council. The subdivider may file a final plat limited to such portion of the preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such portion must conform to all requirements of this chapter.
166.10 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT. The procedure for approval of a final plat is as follows:
1. Preparation of Final Plat. After approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission and Council, the plat may then be prepared in final form, and both survey and plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved, including the required modifications.
2. Information and Requirements Necessary for Recording. Final plat shall contain all the information and requirements necessary for recording with the County Recorder and Auditor, including accurate dimensions previously submitted and approved in the preliminary plat, which information accurately delineates and defines the subdivision included in such final plat.
CHAPTER 166 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
3. Filing and Referral of Final Plat. The final plat and at least six (6) prints thereof, with required data accompanying each, shall be filed with the Clerk within twelve (12) months after the date of approval of the preliminary plat. The final plat shall be submitted, along with written application for approval of the final plat, at least fifteen (15) days prior to a Commission meeting at which consideration is requested. The Clerk shall retain the original and two (2) prints for Commission use. One (1) print each shall immediately be forwarded to the Zoning Administrator, Public Works Director and other designated officials for review. They will prepare comments prior to the next meeting of the Commission. The Zoning Administrator shall check the final plat and accompanying data for any conditions or modifications of the preliminary plat, and shall also check the plat and survey for required accuracy.
4. Action by Commission. Approval or disapproval of the plat will be conveyed to the subdivider in writing within ten (10) days after the meeting of the Commission at which such plat was considered. In case the plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified of the reason for such action and what requirements shall be necessary to meet the approval of the Commission.
5. Approval of the Council. After a review and approval of the final plat by the Commission, such final plat, together with the recommendations of the Commission, shall be submitted to the Council for approval. If accepted, the final plat shall be approved by resolution, which resolution shall provide for the acceptance of all streets, alleys, easements or other public ways and parks or other open spaces dedicated to public purposes. Failure of the Council to act on the application within sixty (60) days shall be deemed as approval. If disapproved, the grounds for any refusal to approve a plat shall be set forth in the proceedings of the Council and reported to the person applying for such approval.
6. Final Plat Recording. Upon final approval of the final plat by the Council, the subdivider shall record it with the County Recorder and Auditor within one hundred (100) days after the date of approval; otherwise, the approval of the final plat is null and void.

Notwithstanding the preceding subsection, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Zoning Administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Atlantic Municipal Airport.
167.06 PERMITS.
1. Future Uses. No permit is required for the construction or alteration of any structure or growth of any tree if the height of said structure or tree falls into the following categories:
A. No permit is required for any structure or growth of any tree up to a height of 50 feet above the surface of the land.
B. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit is required for any structure or growth of any trees less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
C. In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit is required for any structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zone.
D. In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit is required for any structure or growth of any tree less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
E. In addition, in any of the individual areas described in subsections B, C and D above, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure which—regardless of its proposed vertical height above the ground—does not extend to as great a height above sea level as any of the natural terrain located directly between the location of the proposed tree or structure and any portion of the existing or proposed airport runways.
The foregoing exceptions shall not be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter except as set forth in subsection A. A permit is required when the construction or alteration of any structure or growth of any tree exceeds the height limitations of the foregoing exceptions as set forth in subsections A, B, C or D above. An application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient information to allow it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
-960-
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection 3 of this section.
2. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
3. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. However, no such variance shall be granted unless the Board finds, based upon written advice from the Federal Aviation Administration that:
A. In an application to permit any structure, tree or use of land to exceed the height or use limitations of this chapter, that such structure, tree or use of land would not obstruct landing and takeoff of aircraft at the airport.
B. In an application to permit a use of land otherwise prohibited herein, that such use would not be incompatible with airport operations.
An applicant for a variance hereunder shall, as part of the application submitted to the Board, file the required written advice of the FAA. No application for a variance hereunder shall be set for hearing by the Board until such advice has been filed. Such advice shall not be binding upon the Board of Adjustment, but shall be one of the factors considered by the Board when reaching its decision.
4. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain at the owner’s expense such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Municipal Airport, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
167.07 ENFORCEMENT. It is the duty of the Airport Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Airport Zoning Administrator upon a form published for that purpose.

This Ordinance shall regulate and restrict the height of structures, objects, and growth of natural vegetation, as well as land uses; otherwise regulating the use of property, within the vicinity of the Atlantic Municipal Airport. Creation of appropriate zones and establishing the boundaries thereof, as well as providing for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones is vested in this Ordinance. Atlantic Land Use & Height Zoning Maps are incorporated into and made part of this Ordinance. The Ordinance also provides for the enforcement of the Ordinance, the establishment of a Board of Adjustment; and imposition of penalties related to the implementation of the Ordinance.
168.02 AUTHORITY
Iowa Code Section 329.3 Airport Zoning empowers local municipalities to zone airports including height restrictions and land uses.
168.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
The Atlantic Municipal Airport is acknowledged as an essential public facility to the State of Iowa and the local community.
The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and poses a potential concern to the surrounding communities served by the Atlantic Municipal Airport.
There shall be no creation or establishment of a hazard that endangers public health, safety, welfare, and impacts an individual’s quality of life nor prevents the safe movement of aircraft at the Atlantic Municipal Airport.
For the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards.
The prevention of airport hazards shall be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by proper exercise of the police power.
The prevention of new airport hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards, are considered to be a public purpose for
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
-964-
which the City of Atlantic may raise and expend public funds, as an incident to the operation of airports, to acquire or property interest therein.

The Airport Tall Structure Zoning Regulations were established by an Ordinance adopted on May 2, 2007 and are illustrated on the official Atlantic Municipal Airport Layout Plan consisting of fifteen sheets, prepared by Snyder & Associates, Inc., and dated August 2008, attached as Exhibit B to this Ordinance. Such Airport Layout Plan may be amended, and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other information thereon, is herby adopted as part of this Ordinance.
168.08 LAND USE SAFETY ZONES
FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZ’s have been combined to create five airport overlay zones. These five zones are designed to maintain compatible land uses around the Atlantic Airport. The zones shall be evaluated for compatible land uses.
CODE OF ORDINANCES, ATLANTIC, IOWA
-973-
168.08.A. Definition of Zones.
Five airport overlay zoning districts are prescribed within this Ordinance Specific dimensions for the individual zones for each runway end are noted in the following tables and text.
The Airport Land Use & Height Overlay Zoning Maps should be evaluated to determine the specific area of impact associated with each zone.
Zone A – Runway Protection Zone (RPZ)
Zone A is intended to provide a clear area that is free of above-ground obstructions and structures. This zone is closest to the individual runway ends. The dimensional standards for this zone are the same as those described in the Airport Design AC (AC 150/5300-13 Change 11) and are shown in the following table.

1 The RPZ dimensional standards are for the runway end with the specified approach visibility minimums. The departure RPZ dimensional standards are equal to or less than the approach RPZ dimensional standards. When an RPZ begins other than 200 feet (60m) beyond the runway end, separate approach and departure RPZs should be provided. Refer to FAA AC 150/5300-13, Change 11, Appendix 14 for approach and departure RPZs. Source: FAA AC 150/5300, Change 11, Airport Design Standards.
Zone B – Approach Surface
Zone B is a critical airport overlay zoning surface that reflects the approach and departure areas for each runway at an airport. The size of Zone B is predicated upon the type of approach (visual, non-precisions, or precision) that a specific runway has and the type/size of aircraft utilizing the runway. The following table illustrates the various sizes of Zone B based upon the specific runway criteria. A portion of Zone B is overlain by Zone A because the approach surface and RP overlap the entire length of the RPZ. Consequently, the length of Zone B begins at the inner edge of the RPZ.

Zone C – Transitional Surface
Zone C includes those areas that are parallel to the runway pavement and extend 1,050’ from the edge of the primary surface paralleling the runway and extended runway centerline until they reach the end of Zone A at a 90 degree angle. The specific dimensions for Zone C are based upon various options for the primary surface that is predicated upon the type of approach and critical aircraft.
Zone D – Horizontal Surface
Zone D is typically elliptical in shape, depending upon the runway types and configurations at individual airports.
Zone E – Conical Surface
Zone E is the outermost zone of the airport overlay zoning areas and has the least number of land use restriction considerations. The zone begins at the edge of the horizontal surface and is 4,000 feet in width paralleling the horizontal surface.
168.08. B Zone Compatibility
The following tables shall be utilized to evaluate land use compatibility for various land use classifications.
1. Uses identified as compatible shall not require additional review, however, consideration should be given to the following five areas of concerns:
a. Noise sensitive issues
b. High concentrations of people
c. Tall structures
d. Visual obstructions
e. Wildlife and bird attractants
2. Uses found to be NOT compatible shall be precluded from development within the specific zones.
3. Uses found to require additional review shall be evaluated for general compatibility utilizing the Compatible Land Use Planning Checklist and the five primary areas of concern noted above.

16.010 STATEMENT OF INTENT
The "P.U.D." District is intended and designed to provide a means of the development or redevelopment of tracts of ground on a unit basis, allowing greater flexibility and diversification of land uses and building locations than the conventional single lot method provided in other sections of this ordinance. It is further the intent of this section that the basic principles of good land use planning, including an orderly and graded relationship between various types of uses, be maintained and that the zoning standards as set forth in this ordinance and statutes concerning light and air, recreation and open space, and building coverage be preserved.
It is the intent of the City of Atlantic that the planned residential, commercial and industrial development be encouraged for areas of the community, as appropriate, in particular those areas of the community now undeveloped and those areas which in time would be annexed to the City.
16.020 PERMITTED USES
Normal permitted uses are those of a residential character including single-family (detached or attached), two family and/or multiple family dwellings, and the usual accessory buildings, such as garages, storage space, maintenance structures, and buildings for recreational purposes. The same applies for commercial uses.
A. It must be so designed to reflect the character of the development; and,
B. In any district more than one principal structure may be erected on a lot.
16.030 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
A. Open Space Requirements. A major portion of any PUD is its open space. The desirability is closely tied to the integration of open space with the total development. A minimum of 20 percent of the land area shall be retained for common open air recreational uses and other usable open space. Quality standards acknowledge the separate and multiple functions of open space; active recreation, passive recreation, and preservation of natural site amenities. In designing a PUD, consideration shall be given to such functions. The term open spaces shall not include space devoted to streets and parking of the developer and City. Such conveyance may be by dedication or easement.
64
B. Yard Requirements. The minimum lot and yard and setback requirements of the conventional zoning districts in which the development is located shall not apply, except that minimum yards specified in the conventional district for suitable screening or buffering shall be provided around the boundary of the development. In the absence of any appropriate physical barrier, the Council may require open space or screening be located along all or a portion of the development boundary. While the minimum yard requirements of the conventional zoning district in which the development is located do not apply, a minimum distance of ten feet between buildings shall be observed.
C. Maximum Density. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a "P.U.D." development district shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the following maximum densities:
Zoning Classification Maximum Density R-l 7,500 sq. ft. per unit
R-2 Single family detached dwelling unit
5,600 sq. ft. per unit;
All other units 3,700 sq. ft. per unit
R-3 Single family detached dwelling unit
4,500 sq. ft. per unit;
All other units 2,800 sq. ft per unit
R-4 Single family detached dwelling unit
3,600 sq. ft. per unit;
All other units 1,900 sq. ft. per unit
Net development area shall be determined by subtracting from the gross development area any area proposed for streets.
If the development contains two or more zoning district classifications, the number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by adding the maximum dwelling units allowable for each proportional part, but the dwelling units may be located within the development irrespective of the conventional zoning district classification of any particular area. However, if the development area includes land in a Flood Plain District, maximum of thirty (30) percent of such land may be used in determining the number of dwelling units that can be built within the entire development. No dwelling shall be placed on land zoned "F" in an "P.U.D." development.
E. Height Limitations. There shall be no maximum height
requirements. However, heights shall be regulated to the extent that it is related to the proposed development and to the general area within which the development is proposed to be located.
F. Other Considerations. A number of major factors should undergo evaluation as a portion of design standards. These include:
1. Natural drainage areas shall be retained as appropriate and, if necessary, improved.
2. Due consideration shall be given to preserving
natural site amenities and minimizing the disturbance to the natural environment.
3. Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The location of the trees is to be
65
considered in designing building locations, underground services, and paved areas.
4. If the development includes flood plain areas, they shall be preserved as permanent open spaces.
5. Due consideration shall be given to the natural
topography and major grade change shall be avoided. If the development includes hillsides and slopes, special evaluation shall be given to geological conditions exist, and topsoil loss. If unfavorable development conditions exist, the City Council may restrict clearing, cutting, filling, or other substantial changes in the natural conditions of the affected area.
16.040 SUPPLEMENTARY AND BULK REGULATIONS
No part of an area required for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section shall be included as an area required for another lot.
16.050 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
Two parking spaces per single unit dwelling and two parking spaces per unit for two or more unit dwellings. All other permitted uses shall be as required by Article 20.

30.030 Definitions
30.040 Landscape Materials and Installation Standards
30.050 Screening Requirements
30.060 Planting Lists
30.010 INTENT
The landscaping and screening standards provide additional guidance on the development of sites within Atlantic by addressing landscaping and screening requirements. They are designed to improve and protect the appearance of the community; buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another; and preserve the value of properties within the City of Atlantic and surrounding areas where extraterritorial zoning is adopted.
30.020 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this section shall apply to all new development on each lot or site upon application for a building permit, except for the following:
A. Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or structure following a loss by fire, storm, tornado or other act of God greater than 60% of total building gross floor area.
B. Remodeling, rehabilitation or improvements to existing uses which do not require a building permit, or structures which do not substantially change the location of structures, parking or other site improvements.
C. Additions or enlargements to existing uses or structures that increase floor area or impervious coverage area by less than twenty-five percent 50%and that are less than 5,000 square feet. Where such additions or enlargements are 50%or greater or larger than 5,000 square feet, these provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new development occurs.
A development may continue to comply with the buffer yard and screening requirements in effect at the time of issuance of its original permit, regardless of whether an adjacent lot or site is subsequently rezoned to a less intensive district which would otherwise require compliance with buffer yard or screening provisions.
30.030 DEFINITIONS
For the interpretation of this section, the following definitions shall be used:
A. “Greenspace area” means an area devoted to or developed predominately with plant material or natural landscape features, including lawn, ground cover, gardens, trees, shrubs and
124
other plant materials. At a minimum “greenspace” includes grass or ground cover plus additional trees, shrubs or other screening where required herein.
B. “Screened” means shielded, concealed and effectively hidden from view by a person standing at ground level on an abutting site along the property line, or outside the area or feature so screened, by a fence, wall, hedge, berm or similar architectural or landscaped feature. In the event of sloping topography, the adjacent property line shall be the geographic reference point wherever screening is required.
3. Landscaping Requirements. Single-family and two-family dwellings shall maintain a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of lot area as a permeable and uncovered surface that contains living materials. Single-family and two-family dwellings are exempt from other requirements of this section. All other uses shall provide and maintain a greenspace area that equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total lot area unless specified otherwise herein.
30.040 LANDSCAPING MATERIALS AND INSTALLATION STANDARDS
A. Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with accepted good planting procedures and other applicable City Codes and policies. The plant materials shall form an effective screen based on the approved site plan within five (5) growing seasons of installation. Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment. Installation of required landscaping shall be done within one year after the date of building completion.
B. Use of Inorganic Landscaping Materials. No artificial trees, shrubs, plants or turf shall be used to fulfill the minimum requirements for landscaping. Inorganic materials, such as stone or decorative pavers, may be used provided that such material does not comprise more than 35% of the minimum required landscaped area. Other concrete and/or asphalt pavement surfaces may not be used within the minimum required landscaped area, except for walkways less than five (5) feet in width.
C. Plant Material.
(1) Trees. Trees shall be a minimum of one inch (1") caliper [as measured one (1) foot above ground level] at the time of planting.
(2) Shrubs and Hedges. Shrubs shall be minimum of twelve (12) inches in height when measured at ground level immediately after planting. Hedges, where required, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen within a maximum of five (5) years after time of planting.
(3) Vines. Vines may be used in conjunction with fences, screens, or walls to meet physical barrier requirements as specified.
(4) Ground Covers. Ground covers used in lieu of grass, in whole or in part, shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage within twelve (12) months after planting.
D. Location of Required Landscaping. The following areas are listed by priority for the placement of the required landscaped area:
(1) A minimum greenspace area of five feet (5') in width along all street frontages unless a greater width is required per Tables 30.040-1 or per the maturation factor specified
125
below. Street/right-of-way landscaping shall not be located within the public right-of-way itself with the exception of City or State right-of-way landscaping.
(2) A minimum greenspace area of five feet (5') in width along all perimeter property lines unless a greater width is required per Tables 30.040-1. This five-foot perimeter greenspace area requirement does not apply to side yards where zero foot interior side yard setbacks are allowed
(3) Trees required as part of Type C right-of-way plantings shall be placed at least one-half the maturation diameter from the right-of-way line.
E. Landscaping for Off-Street Parking Areas. All off-street parking areas (except for single and two-family uses) shall provide site trees on the basis of one (1) tree for every ten (10) off-street parking spaces provided or fraction thereof. Fifty percent (50%) of required site trees shall be placed along street frontages. The remaining 50% may be placed in interior parking lot areas. Site trees shall be of a minimum one inch (1") caliper as measured one (1) foot above ground level at the time of planting. Further, required site trees may be utilized in conjunction with parking area screening requirements as set forth in this section.
(1) Parking areas in the I-2 Heavy Industrial Zoning District shall be exempt from the landscaping requirements except where said parking areas are adjacent non-industrial zoning districts or uses or where they are located adjacent a Residential or Commercial District.

30.050 SCREENING REQUIREMENTS
Table 30.040-1, Table of Screening Requirements, found later in this section, refers to the following types of screens listed below. The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are to be used as the basis for screening requirements to buffer conflicting zones and uses abutting one another. Variations of these screening types which do not alter the intent of this section may be permitted at the time of site plan review with approval from the Zoning Administrator or Planning & Zoning Commission, whichever holds authority over the proposed development.
A. Opaque Screen, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet (6') with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet (12'), except that uses in the or other uses that have a zero lot line setback and utilize a wall or fence to meet Type A screening requirements shall only be required to achieve the 6' tall, opaque screening standard. The opaque screen is intended to exclude all
126
visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of physical separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted or existing vegetation. Planted vegetation or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or by field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completed unobstructed openings more than ten feet (10') wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these screens (for vegetative screen) shall be in accordance with Table 30.040-1, but in no case less than five feet (5') in width. The following are typical Type A Opaque Screens:
• Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).
• Six-foot high evergreen shrubbery planted four (4) feet on center (see Planting List D).
• Medium or large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting List B or C).
• Six-foot high earth-tone or natural colored wooden fence with intermittent trees (where maximum fence height restrictions allow).
• Six-foot high earth-tone or natural colored wooden fence or earth-tone or natural colored masonry wall (where maximum fence height restrictions allow).
• Medium or large evergreen trees, planted staggered, with the branches touching the ground (see Planting List E or F).
B. Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet (3'), with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet (12') except that uses in the or other uses that have a zero lot line setback and utilize a wall or fence to meet Type B screening requirements are only required to achieve a 3' tall, opaque screen with intermittent visual obstruction to a minimum height of six (6) feet. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species or by field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet (10') wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these screens (for vegetative screens) shall be in accordance with Table 30.040-1, but in no case less than five feet (5') in width. The following are typical Type B Semi-Opaque Screens.
1. Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).
2. Three-foot high earth-tone or natural colored stone or masonry wall with intermittent trees.
3. Small trees planted twenty (20) to thirty (30) feet on center on top of berm (see Planting List A).
4. Three-foot high seeded or sodded earth berm (see Berming Requirements) with intermittent trees.
127
5. Large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting List C).
6. Three-foot high evergreen hedge shrubbery planted three (3) on center (see Planting List D).
C. Broken Screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least twelve feet (12'). The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these screens (for vegetative screens) shall be in accordance with Table 30.040-1, but in no case less than five feet (5') in width. The following are typical Type C Broken Screens:
1. Small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center (see Planting List A).
2. Split rail or picket wooden fence with intermittent trees (fence colors for screening purposes shall be earth tone, white or natural wood colors).
3. Medium or large trees planted forty (40) feet on center (see Planting List B or C).
4. Small trees planted forty (40) feet on center with assorted shrubbery (see Planting Lists A, D, and G).
5. Assorted shrubbery combined with other plantings (see Planting Lists D and G).
6. Screening Locations. Screening, as required in the Table of Screening Requirements, shall be required along the common lot lines of adjacent uses. Where uses are separated by an intervening right-of-way, the burdened use need only screen from the adjoining right-of-way as required in the Table. Screening required by a burdened use for a benefited use shall apply only to those uses which are determined to be permitted within the particular zoning district. A burdened use is not required to provide screening to benefit a use within a zoning district that is determined to be a nonconforming use.
7. Fencing. Fencing used as screening shall comply with the regulations of Section 30.040-1 of this chapter. In the event of conflict with the Landscaping and Screening provisions, the provisions of Section 30.040.-1 shall apply.
