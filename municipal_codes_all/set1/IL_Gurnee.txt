PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Gurnee, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 93-158, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the President and Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Senior Code Attorney, and Bill Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bradly J. Burke, Assistant Village Administrator, and Barbara J. Swanson, Village Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

k)  After the plumbing fixtures have been set and their traps filled with water, their connections shall be tested and proved gas and watertight. The test for gas and water tightness of the completed drainage and vent system shall be made by filling all traps with water, and then introducing int the system a pungent, thick smoke produced by one or more smoke machines. When the smoke appears at stack openings on the roof, the stack opening shall be closed and a pressure equivalent to a one-inch water column shall be maintained for the period of the inspection. Where the department or local plumbing inspector finds that a smoke test cannot be performed, a peppermint test may be substituted. A peppermint test is conducted by introducing two ounces of oil of peppermint into the roof terminal of every line or stack to be tested. Immediately after the oil of peppermint is introduced into the system, ten quarts of hot (160 degrees Fahrenheit) water shall be added, and each terminal sealed. The detection of the odor of peppermint at any trap or at any other point in the plumbing system denotes a leak. Individuals whose body or clothing have come in contact with oil of peppermint shall be excluded from the area until the test is completed.

Sec. 30-31. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known, and may be cited as, the security alarm service ordinance, regulating burglar, hold up, panic and duress alarms, and other security alarm systems and users. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(A); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-32. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards and regulations applicable to police alarm systems and alarm users. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm systems means a security device installed for the purpose of alerting others to a police emergency requiring urgent attention, such as an unauthorized entry onto the premises, the commission of an unlawful act, or a fire emergency, and to which police are expected to respond. Fire alarm systems, industrial or supervisory alarm systems monitoring temperature, humidity or any other condition not directly related to police functions are excluded from the provisions of this article. 
    Alarm user means any person on whose premises an alarm system is maintained within the village except for alarm systems on motor vehicles or proprietary systems. If, however, an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises, other than a proprietary system, the person using such system is an alarm user. Proprietary systems, self-contained systems alerting on premises only, are also exempted by this article. 
    Annunciator means the instrumentation of an alarm console at the receiving terminal of a signal line which through both visual and audible signals shows when an alarm device at a particular location has been activated, or indicating line trouble. 
    Answering service means a telephone service providing among its services, the service of receiving on a continuous basis through trained employees, emergency signals from alarm systems, and thereafter immediately relaying the message by live voice to the communication center of the police department. 
    Automatic telephone/dialing alarm means a telephone device or attachment which automatically relays a taped or prerecorded message to report a robbery, burglary or fire emergency by means of a regular or 911 emergency telephone line (primary trunk line) which terminates upon a central switchboard. 
    Burglar alarm (also known as intrusion alarm) means and designates an attempted or successful but unlawful entry onto or into a premises, activating such alarm. 
    Central station means an office to which remote alarm and supervisory signaling devices are connected, where operators supervise the circuits, and guards are maintained continuously to investigate signals. 
    Central station system means a system in which the operation of electrical protection circuits and devices are signaled automatically to, recorded in, maintained, and supervised from a central station having trained operators and guards in attendance at all times. 
    Direct connect means an alarm system which has the capability to transmit and receive system signals to and from an agency maintained by the local government, such as a police communications center. 
    Duress alarm means a special coded alarm used during the forced shut down of an alarm system by coercion, such code being entered to alert the central station that there is a police emergency in spite of a normal shut down. 
    False alarms means an alarm system activated by all causes not related to an actual or attempted unauthorized entry on the premises, the commission of an unlawful act or a fire emergency, provided, however, that any alarm activated by natural causes including, but not limited to, tornadoes, and severe windstorms, or by malicious acts of persons not under the direction or control of the licensee of an alarm system or any other cause clearly beyond the control of the licensee shall not be considered a false alarm. 
    Local alarm system means a signaling system which when activated, causes an audible and or visual signal device to be activated in or on or about the premises within which the system is installed. Also for purposes of this article, it refers to that type of alarm system that is designed to alert persons at the premises of an intrusion. This system may also include audible inside or outside ringers, bells or sirens with or without accompanying lights, and can be heard by persons inside or outside the premises to include the general public. 
    Panic or hold up alarm means an alarm that is tripped by personnel present at the location of the alarm designating a police emergency requiring urgent attention due to robbery, assault or some other unlawful act. 
    Primary trunk line means a telephone line leading directly into a communications center of the police department that is for the purpose of handling emergency and nonemergency calls on a person to person basis, to include 911 emergency lines or regular published nonemergency lines covering the service area within the police/fire department jurisdiction. 
    Proprietary system means an alarm system sounding and/or recording alarm signals at a control center located within the protected premises, and the control center being under the supervision of the proprietor of the premises. If the proprietary system includes a signal alarm connected directly or by means of an automatic dialing device to a police communications center, a central station, modified central station, or an answering service, it thereby becomes an alarm system as defined in this article. 
    Special trunk line means a telephone line leading into the communications center of the police department and having the primary purpose of handling the emergency signals or messages originating either directly or through a central location from automatic dialing devices. 
    Subscriber means a person who buys, leases, or otherwise obtains an alarm signaling system and thereafter contracts with or hires an alarm business to monitor or service the alarm.

Sec. 30-39. - Differentiation of burglar and hold up alarms mandatory. 
    No alarm subscribers shall install or use an existing alarm system, after appropriate notice has been given, that does not differentiate the alarm signal sent to the central receiving station (be it a direct connect to the village police department annunciator panel or another outside answering service) particularizing intrusion or burglar alarms versus hold up, panic or duress alarms. The subscriber shall have installed, at his expense, the appropriate device(s) or phone line system for separation of these types of signals at their location that then therefore isolate the particular signal at the receiving station annunciator panel. For those entities using reverse polarity type lines, two such lines shall be maintained to separate burglary or intrusion alarms from hold up, panic, and duress alarms, commonly set off by intent through working personnel on the premises as opposed to inadvertent trip of the security alarm system by persons engaged in unlawful entry attempts. For entities with fiber optic or digital lines, they shall ensure that separate position codes are programmed by their alarm installer to either the village police station annunciator panel or to their own contracted alarm service agency, so that these signals are differentiated. For multipurpose alarm businesses or private residences, it shall be unlawful to use an alarm signal that only utilizes one board position signaling true alarm status, trouble, or secure only, and not differentiating between situational signals. Upon written notice by the chief of police the subscriber shall have 90 days to comply with this section. Failure to do so will result in a taken out of service status on the police annunciator panel or official notice to the alarm subscriber and his contracted alarm company that alarm service calls will not be accepted until the system is corrected. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(I); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-40. - Backup power system. 
    Each alarm user in the village shall provide a source of power (battery backup system) for his alarm system to prevent false alarms due to power failures from the utility company. Such alternate sources of power shall provide power for a minimum of 24 hours. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(J); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-41. - Local alarm for burglar and/or hold up alarm. 
    The use of an outside ringer is hereby declared a public nuisance and unlawful in the village. No person or business entity shall use a signaling system which when activated causes an audible and or visual signaling device to be activated outside the premises within which the system is installed that causes such signal to be heard by the general public outside the business or residence premises. This section does not apply to a local alarm system that mainly activates signals inside the premises. Specifically precluded from use are outside ringers such as audible bells, audible burglar alarms, police or fire sirens alone or in combination with visible burglar alarm signals using flashing or rotating lights of any color, red, blue or amber. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(K); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-42. - False alarms prohibited. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly, recklessly, or negligently cause the activation of an alarm system used for the purpose of summoning police unless such person knows or suspects that there is an actual or attempted unauthorized entry on the premises, commission of an unlawful act or fire emergency. For purposes of this article actions of an agent of the principal shall be binding on the principal. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(L); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-43. - Alarm system deactivation requirement. 
(a)  It shall be a mandatory duty that a keyholder respond to every alarm activated, within one hour, where the police responding summon a representative of the entity to help investigate cause. Failure of keyholders to respond to alarm situations at the request of the on scene police officers to deactivate the alarm shall be reported to the chief of police. More than 12 instances in a calendar year recorded of a failure of such response shall be cause for taking the particular alarm subscriber's system out of service. After eight such failures to respond, a warning letter shall be issued advising the proprietor of this section, and that continued absence of a keyholder could lead to suspension of police services for that entity's alarm system. 
(b)  The person, firm or corporation having an alarm system shall be required to post or cause to be posted, at or near the location where such alarm systems can be deactivated, a notice containing the name, address and telephone number of the person, firm, or corporation responsible for the maintenance and repair of such alarm system. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(M); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997) 
Sec. 30-44. - Charges for responses to false alarms and reports. 
(a)  If the village police department responds to more than three false alarm reports during a calendar quarter ("Calendar quarter" means a period of three consecutive calendar months, ending with the last day of March, June, September or December) at the same premises, the subscriber of such alarm system shall pay the village a fine as set forth in section 32-37 within 30 days after the bill or notice is mailed.

(d)  Within ten days after the subscriber's request for reconsideration has been reviewed, the chief of police or his/her designee shall determine whether the alarm was false or not and notify the subscriber of his/her decision in writing, affirming or modifying the bill and assessments. 
(e)  There shall be a 60-day grace period for a new installation when there have been major construction changes to the-subscriber's premises, before an alarm will be considered a false alarm. 
(Code 1977, § 3.21(N); Ord. No. 97-82, 7-7-1997; Ord. No. 2013-40, § VII, 8-19-2013; Ord. No. 2016-66, § I, 9-12-2016)

This fee will be applied monthly until the balance is paid in full. 
(c)  When false alarms repeatedly sound at a single location during a 24-hour period creating an undue burden upon the resources of the fire or police departments, the departments shall be authorized to summarily disconnect the alarm or take it out of service from the police communications center. The bureau deputy chief or designee in charge of the police communications center will immediately contact the alarm subscriber experiencing this problem by phone or in person and explain this out of service necessity. It is the burden of the alarm subscriber/licensee to file a written report with the police department as soon as possible thereafter explaining the cause of the repeated alarms and stating that the condition has been rectified. The particular alarm subscribers alarm will remain out of service until this report is given in writing to the police department. For problems such as this, the false alarm fee can be waived by the chief of police in lieu of an extenuating problem that required immediate repair.

(Ord. No. 2012-93, § II, 12-17-2012)

(a)  Every petition filed and processed pursuant to this Code and/or the zoning ordinance that requires the village to incur third party costs or expenses, including without limitation legal fees incurred by the office of the village attorney or any attorney or firm retained by the village, shall be subject to the cost recovery fee and lien provisions set forth in this section. The cost recovery fee shall be in addition to any and all other filing fees and other charges established pursuant to this Code and/or the zoning ordinance. For purposes of this section, the word "petition" shall be deemed to include and refer to any and all petitions and applications filed or processed with the village board. 
(b)  The owner of the property that is the subject of the petition and, if different, the petitioner, shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the cost recovery fee, and for the cost recovery lien. By signing the petition, the owner or petitioner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay, and to have consented to, the cost recovery fee, plus any costs of collection, that have not been paid within 30 days following the mailing of a written demand for payment to the owner or petitioner at the address set forth on the petition, including any additional cost recovery fees assessed herein.

Sec. 32-41. - Establishment of escrow account. 
    For each petition filed and processed pursuant to this Code and/or the zoning ordinance that requires the village to incur third party costs or expenses, an application fee escrow account shall be established as provided below: 
(1)  Initial deposit. Every petition filed that requires the village to incur third party costs or expenses shall be accompanied by an initial deposit for purposes of paying additional application fees. The amount of the initial deposit shall be determined by the zoning administrator or designee, and the initial deposit and any subsequent deposit shall be placed in an application fee escrow account. No interest shall be payable on any such escrow account. 
(2)  Draws from escrow. From the date of filing of any petition, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the actual costs of processing and reviewing the petition. The village shall, from time to time, draw funds from the escrow account established to pay costs identified in section 18-41 and shall transfer funds to the appropriate village accounts. The village shall maintain an accurate record of all draws. 
(3)  Additional deposits. Should the village at any time determine that the escrow account established in connection with any petition is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of processing a petition, the village shall inform the applicant of that fact in writing and demand an additional deposit in an amount deemed to be sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and until such additional amount is deposited by the applicant, the village may direct that processing of the petition be suspended or terminated. Any termination shall be deemed a withdrawal of the petition by the applicant. 
(4)  Final settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final action on a petition, the village shall cause a final accounting to be made of the escrow deposits made in connection with the petition and the actual costs of processing the petition and shall make a final charge of costs against the escrow deposit. A copy of the accounting shall be provided to the applicant. If the amount in the escrow is insufficient to pay the total actual costs, a written demand for payment of the balance due shall be mailed to the applicant. If any unused balance remains in the escrow account after paying the total actual costs, that amount shall be returned to the applicant. 
(5)  Waiver for specified public and charitable bodies. Certain cost recovery fees may be waived pursuant to section 18-72. 
(6)  Condition of all petitioners, approvals, and permits. No petition filed pursuant to this Code and/or the zoning ordinance shall be considered complete unless and until all fees due have been paid. Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this Code and/or the zoning ordinance shall, whether or not expressly so conditioned, be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of cost recovery fees. 
(7)  Time periods. Where this Code and/or the zoning ordinance provides that the passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or recommendation for approval, all time periods shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue to run. 
(8)  Failure to pay. The failure to fully pay cost recovery fees when due shall be grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or revoking any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid fee relates.

( Ord. No. 2018-87, § II, 12-17-2018 ) 
Sec. 34-221. - Fees. 
(a)  Applicability. Each person that receives emergency and non-emergency services from the village shall be charged a user fee for such services performed by the village on behalf of such person, including the cost of personnel, supplies and equipment dispatched to the scene of motor vehicle incidents and other emergency incidents, which are based on the actual costs of the services and those costs that are usual, customary and reasonable (UCR). 
(b)  Billing rates. The village administrator or designee shall cause a bill to be issued and sent to the appropriate entity or person responsible for payment for emergency and non-emergency mitigation services. The village board shall establish the schedule of the applicable fees for all emergency and non-emergency mitigation services rendered. The village board is authorized to modify or change the fees from time to time based upon, but not limited to, applicable reimbursement rates, costs standards and actual cost of services and supplies. The mitigation rates set by the village board shall include flat fees, except as otherwise identified, and have been determined to be usual, customary and reasonable for the incident responses listed. The mitigation rates shall be determined by itemizing costs for a typical incident (from the time a fire apparatus leaves the station until it returns to the station) and are based on the actual costs, using amortized schedules for apparatus (including useful life, equipment, repairs and maintenance) and labor rates (based upon an average department's "actual personnel expense", and not simply a firefighter's basic wage). The actual personnel expense includes costs such as wages, retirement, benefits, workers' compensation, insurance, etc. When a bill is submitted, it will be itemized and based on the actual services provided in accordance with the established rates. 
(c)  Billing procedures. The mitigation rates shall represent an additional cost of the claim for damages of the vehicles, property and/or injuries, and shall be filed with the insurance carrier of the owner of the vehicle, owner of the property or the responsible party(ies) as set forth above. In some circumstances, the responsible party will be billed directly. In all cases, however, the village will endeavor to obtain insurance coverage as a primary mitigation source. The village will exhaust all avenues related to insurance coverage, and will only charge individuals as a last line of defense when all insurance companies involved deny the claim(s). 
(d)  Collection procedures. Any person or entity that refuses to pay or fails to pay charges billed will be deemed to have violated this article. The village may pursue all remedies at law and equity to recover service charges due and owing, including the use of the services of a collection agency. In addition to the provisions herein, the procedures for collection of fees shall be pursuant to the village's account receivable policy and other applicable village rules and regulations. 
(e)  Allocation of fees. All fees collected in conformance with this section shall be deposited in the general fund of the village.

Sec. 46-122. - Obscenity. 
(a)  Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he: 
(1)  Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of the obscene; 
(2)  Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene;

(2)  The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and

(c)  Interpretation of evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience. Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
(1)  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
(2)  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
(3)  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof; 
(4)  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
(5)  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; 
(6)  Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. 
(d)  Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(e)  Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age; 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.

Sec. 52-2. - Purpose. 
(a)  The sign regulations of this article are intended to balance the public interest-in promoting a safe, well-maintained, and attractive village-with the interests of businesses, organizations, and individuals in ensuring the ability to identify and advertise products, services, and ideas. The regulations have the following specific objectives: 
(1)  To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in a way that protects life, health, property, and the public welfare;

(5)  To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected.

(4)  Materials and design. Only distinctive materials/design signs are allowed in the C/S-3 district. 
(b)  Awning or canopy signs. 
(1)  When allowed. Nonilluminated awnings with no more than six square feet of sign (copy) area on the border of the awning may be used in addition to wall signs. Other awning signs or canopy signs may be substituted for allowed wall signs, provided that the total combined number of wall signs and awning and canopy signs may not exceed one per 100 feet of building frontage or fraction thereof. See subsection 52-17(b) for building frontage calculation rules. 
(2)  Maximum area. Letters, logos, and symbols on awning or canopy signs are limited to a maximum area of 0.2 square foot per one foot of awning length or ten percent of the awning area, whichever is less. The total combined length of letters, logos and symbols may not exceed 70 percent of awning or canopy length. In calculating the length and area of an awning or canopy only the single longest plane of the awning or canopy may be counted. This generally means that the valance and sides (ends) of the awning or canopy will not be counted for purposes of measuring length or area. 
(c)  Freestanding signs. 
(1)  Maximum number. A maximum of one freestanding sign is allowed per lot. 
(2)  Maximum area. Freestanding signs may not exceed 15 square feet in area.

Poles or pylons used to support freestanding signs must be constructed of a material or covered or concealed by a decorative cover that is architecturally compatible with the overall design of the sign and the architectural character of buildings on the site, in terms of style, colors, and materials. 
b.  The ground area surrounding the base of all freestanding signs must be landscaped. The landscape area must be at least as large as the sign area. The landscape area must include shrubs, perennial and/or annual flowers, ornamental grasses, and/or vegetative ground cover. Landscape plans, indicating plant materials and location must be submitted with the sign permit application. The zoning administrator is authorized to approve alternative landscape or base treatments if the zoning administrator determines that landscaping at the base of the freestanding sign is impractical because of soil conditions, space constraints or other factors beyond the reasonable control of the applicant. Alternative landscape treatments may include additional landscaping elsewhere on the site, the use of masonry materials to conceal the base of the sign or other treatments that provide an equivalent or higher level of visual amenity than the otherwise required sign base landscaping requirements. 
(6)  Legibility. All letters and numbers in a business' name, as well as the address, must be at least six inches in height and all letters and numbers in any tag line must be at least three inches in height. 
(7)  Address. All freestanding signs must include the street address (number) of the subject property. Street address numbers will not be counted as part of the sign's area.

(Ord. No. 2008-39, § II(Exh. B), 5-5-2008; Ord. No. 2012-90, §§ XI, XII, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 52-16. - Nonconforming, obsolete, and prohibited signs. 
(a)  Nonconforming signs. 
(1)  Any sign lawfully existing or under construction on May 5, 2008, that does not conform to one or more of the provisions of this article may be continued in operation and maintained indefinitely as a nonconforming sign subject to compliance with this article. 
(2)  As an incentive to encourage the removal of nonconforming signs, the village board, after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning board, is expressly authorized to waive sign permit fees and special use permit application fees and approve special use permit requests for replacement signs. In deciding such requests, the planning and zoning board and village board must consider whether the public benefit derived from removal and replacement will be generally proportionate to the fee waiver and/or deviation requested. The planning and zoning board is also authorized to approve minor exception requests for replacement signs if they determine that the public benefit derived from removal and replacement will be generally proportionate to the exception requested. 
(3)  Routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is allowed, including changing of copy, necessary nonstructural repairs, and incidental alterations that do not expand, extend or enlarge the nonconforming features of the sign. However, no structural alteration, enlargement, or expansion may be made to a nonconforming sign unless the alteration, enlargement, or expansion will result in the elimination of the nonconforming features of the sign. 
(4)  A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified to comply with these regulations if the structure to which it is accessory is demolished or destroyed to an extent exceeding 150 percent of the structure's assessed value. A nonconforming sign and sign structure subject to removal under this paragraph must be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the zoning administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and the sign must be removed within 30 days of such notice. 
(5)  A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified to comply with these regulations if the sign and sign structure is demolished or destroyed to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost. A nonconforming sign and sign structure subject to removal under this paragraph must be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the zoning administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and the sign must be removed within 30 days of such notice. 
(6)  A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified to comply with the sign regulations of this article if the business or use on the property ceases to operate for a continuous period of three months or more. If the owner or lessee fails to remove or modify the sign, the zoning administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and the sign and sign structure must be removed within 30 days of such notice. If such sign is not removed or modified after the 30-day period, the village board may take action to authorize the removal of the sign and sign structure at the expense of the owner, agent, or person having beneficial interest in the building or premises on which the sign is located. In addition, the village is authorized to institute and pursue all other available remedies and penalties under the law. 
(b)  Abandoned signs. 
(1)  Except as otherwise expressly stated in this article, any sign that conforms with the regulations of this article and that is located on property that becomes vacant and/or unoccupied for a period of one year or more will be deemed abandoned. (Note: signs that are nonconforming are subject to the provisions of subsection 52-16(a)) Evidence of abandonment relates to the property's disrepair, the lack of building occupancy, the failure of a property owner to maintain business licenses, and other evidence related to the property maintenance. 
(2)  An abandoned sign and its associated sign structure must be removed by the owner of the property on which the sign is located. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the zoning administrator must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and require that the owner remove the sign within 30 days of such notice. If such sign is not removed after the 30-day period, the village board may take action to authorize the removal of the sign at the expense of the owner, agent, or person having beneficial interest in the building or premises on which the sign is located. 
(c)  Obligation to maintain signs. 
(1)  All signs must be maintained in good structural condition and in compliance with all village codes. 
(2)  Any signs that are rotted, unsafe, or unsightly must be repaired or removed by the licensee or owner of the sign. 
(d)  Prohibited signs. The zoning administrator is authorized to remove or have removed all illegal (prohibited) signs located in any public right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2008-39, § II(Exh. B), 5-5-2008; Ord. No. 2012-25, § II, 4-2-2012; Ord. No. 2012-90, § XIII, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 52-17. - Rules of measurement. 
(a)  Rules for measuring sign area. This section sets forth rules for measuring sign area and other regulated dimensional features. 
(1)  Box signs. The area of a box sign is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign face. However, screened box signs with raised or routed out letters, such signs may be measured as described in paragraph (2) below. 

(2)  Channel (individual) letter signs. The area of a sign comprised of individual letters or elements attached to a building wall is determined by calculating the area of the smallest geometric figure (e.g. square, rectangle, circle, polygon, etc) that can be drawn around the letters and/or elements. Signs consisting of individual letters and/or elements will be measured as one sign when the distance between the letters and/or elements is less than the largest dimension of the largest sign letter. 

(3)  Multi-sided signs When the sign faces of a multi-sided sign are parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel, only one side is counted. If the sign faces are not parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel, all sign faces are counted. 

(b)  Rules for measuring building frontage. Many of the wall sign regulations of this chapter are based on building frontage. The following rules govern the measurement of building frontage. 
(1)  For buildings occupied by a single tenant or multiple tenants that access the building via a common entrance, building frontage is the exterior building wall (or walls) that: (1) is adjacent to a street or a parking area or other vehicle circulation area that is accessory to and serves the subject building and (2) contains either windows or a public building entrance. Allowed wall sign area for a building that has two or more building frontages must be calculated on the basis of each individual building frontage. 

(2)  On buildings housing more than one tenant where each tenant has their own outside entrance, a tenant's building frontage is the exterior building wall (or walls) that directly abut the tenant's interior floor space and that: (1) abuts, parallels, or is the nearest to parallel with a street or a parking area or other vehicle circulation area that is accessory to and serves the subject building and (2) contains either windows or a public building entrance. A tenant that has two or more building frontages must calculate the permitted sign area on the basis of each individual building frontage. 

(3)  Regardless of the height, number of stories, or number of tenants in a building, building frontage will be determined by one measurement of the horizontal length of the wall at finished grade. Buildings walls must be measured along a flat, unbroken plane, regardless of the presence of recesses or projections along the building wall. 
(4)  As an alternative to the allocation of permitted sign area on the basis of individual building frontages, a differing allotment of sign area may be assigned to the various tenants upon receipt and approval by the zoning administrator of written authorization from the owner or authorized management firm of the building or development. Such written authorization must be in the form of a master sign plan that complies with the provisions of section 52-12. 
(5)  In no instance may the total combined sign area for all signs exceed the maximum allowed sign area for the individual building frontages, as determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections 52-8(a), 52-9(a), 52-10(a), or 52-11(a). 
(c)  Rules for measuring wall area. The area of a wall is calculated by multiplying the building frontage by the building's height or 15 feet, whichever is less. 

(d)  Rules for measuring window area. The area of a window includes only the glass or glazed elements of the window. Frames, mullions and similar features are not counted as part of the window area.

The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the village's review period. 
The applicant must notify the village in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
e.  Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement, provided by the village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement. 
(3)  Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents and information are specifically enumerated in the village's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the village. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(4)  Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
a.  An express written agreement by both the applicant and the village; or 
b.  A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(5)  Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(6)  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7)  Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information and notices to the village by personal delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means. 
(c)  Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1)  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  [Limitation on collocation.] The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  [Compliance with applicable codes.] The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  [Compliance with design standards.] The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in Article 15 and 16 of the Gurnee Zoning Ordinance. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(d)  Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows: 
(1)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650.00 for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures. 
(2)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable. 
(4)  The village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with subsection d. under the section titled application requirements; or 
c.  The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes. 
(5)  Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures. 
(e)  Exceptions. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on: 
(1)  Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner; 
(2)  Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or 
(3)  Property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this chapter. 
(f)  Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter. 
    A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph. 
(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 
(1)  Two hundred dollars per year; or 
(2)  The actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village utility pole. 
    If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be $200.00 payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.

A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
( Ord. No. 2018-56, § I, 7-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 60-6. - Insurance. 
    The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance:

(b)  Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; 
OR 
(c)  Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage. 
    The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
    A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village. 
( Ord. No. 2018-56, § I, 7-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 60-7. - Appeals. 
    Any wireless provider aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of or conditions established in connection with a permit, variance, or other approval, made by the village engineer under the provisions of this chapter may seek a review of such order, requirement, decision or determination by filing a request for review thereof with the village manager, within 30 days after the notification of the order, requirement, decision or determination. The request for review shall set forth in detail the basis for the request. The village manager shall thereafter consider the request for review, determine whether the order, requirement, decision or determination should be affirmed, modified, modified with conditions, or reversed, and provide a written determination thereof. If such wireless provider seeks further review of the order, requirement, decision or determination, such wireless provider shall file a request to appeal the determination of the village manager with the village clerk within 30 days after mailing of the determination by the village manager; such appeal shall be considered by the board of trustees based on the relevant facts available regarding the order, requirement, decision or determination in question and the materials presented in connection with the request for appeal, as well as materials presented in connection with the manager's review provided under this section.

ARTICLE V. - IMPROVEMENTS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 70-371. - General requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. It is deemed necessary and essential to require and control the provision and installation of improvements when property is subdivided and developed in order to: 
(1)  Ensure conformity to the statutes governing the subdivision of land in the state; 
(2)  Cause the installation of utilities and public service facilities necessary to serve the property developed; 
(3)  Provide for the current financing of such facilities; 
(4)  Spread the costs of required improvements upon the property benefited; 
(5)  Prevent the dissipation or the improper use of public funds in providing these improvements or maintaining faulty installation; 
(6)  Protect the living standards, public safety, and the common welfare of residents within and without the subdivision. 
(b)  Qualifications of contractors. The developer shall file with the village a list of all contractors and subcontractors who are to participate in the construction of public improvements. Such contractors and subcontractors shall be subject to disqualification by reason of faulty performance of prior construction work done in the village. 
(c)  Time of construction. All improvements required in this article shall be completely installed before submittal of the final plat; or, the subdivider shall post a surety subdivision performance bond, letter of credit or cash bond guaranteeing the installation of these improvements within two years following final plat approval by the village board. Additional time may be allowed if approved by the village board. In no case should the additional allocated time exceed three six-month extensions. 
(d)  Sequence of construction. All underground utilities, sanitary sewers, and storm sewers installed in streets, alleys, service roads, or highways shall be constructed or installed prior to the surfacing of such streets. Service connections to such underground utilities and sewers shall be extended to the property line of each lot so as to alleviate disturbing the surface improvements in such public ways when service connections are later made. Where underground utilities are located in the parkway adjacent to the paved roadway, service connections to properties across such roadway shall only be made by drilling under the pavement in such a way that surfacing is not disturbed or weakened. 
(e)  Debris removal. The subdivider shall clean and maintain all public ways, sewers, and drains free from debris and trash, or other extraneous material, prior to acceptance and at such other times during construction as the village engineer deems necessary to prevent the creation of a public nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 68-12, pt. V, § A, 6-3-1968; Ord. No. 93-09, 1-25-1993) 
Sec. 70-372. - Modification of design of improvements during construction. 
    During the course of inspections, the appropriate public inspector will especially note any circumstances which entail departures in the "as-built" improvements from the plans and specifications as approved, such as an unforeseen difficulty of drainage, groundwater, poor subsoil, unstable fill material, or unconventional or faulty practices of contractors of subcontractors. Whenever such departures are likely to cause either a lower ultimate level of performance or a higher construction cost than could reasonably have been anticipated, he shall prepare a report on his findings in the situation and promptly forward copies to the president and board of trustees and to the plat officer. 
(Ord. No. 68-12, pt. V, § B, 6-3-1968) 
Sec. 70-373. - As-built plans. 
    After completion of all public improvement and prior to final acceptance of said improvements, the subdivider shall make, or cause to be made, a complete plan set showing the actual location and elevation of all valves, manholes, stubs, sewer and water mains, street lighting, and other improvements. This plan shall be printed on white bond paper and shall bear the seal and signature of the engineer. The as-built plans shall be provided in accordance with the digital submittal requirements of the Village of Gurnee (see Appendix C.) The presentation of this plan shall be a condition of final acceptance of the improvements and release of the surety assuring their completion. This plan set shall become the property of the village.

Sec. 70-374. - Policy on sharing cost of oversize improvements. 
    Whenever necessary, to conform to an overall plan or otherwise to protect or promote the public interest, oversize improvements may be required of the subdivider; however, the cost to the subdivider shall be no greater than that which would result from the installation of construction of only that size necessitated by his own development. The excess cost resulting from the requirement of an oversize improvement shall be borne by the appropriate public authority. 
(Ord. No. 68-12, pt. V, § D, 6-3-1968) 
Sec. 70-375. - Monuments. 
(a)  Preservation of existing monuments. All United States, state, county, or other official bench marks, monuments, or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the subdivision shall be preserved. When a proposed improvement in a subdivision makes necessary the moving of bench marks, monuments, or stations, the authority having jurisdiction shall be notified and given sufficient time to take appropriate action. 
(b)  Placement of new monuments. Permanent monuments shall be erected at all street corners and all points where street lines intersect the exterior lines of the subdivision and at all lot corners, block corners, angles in the lot lines, and points of beginning and ending of curves. 
(c)  Monument materials. Permanent monuments shall be of galvanized iron pipe not less than three-fourths-inch in diameter and not less than 24 inches in length; or pinch top pipe of the same dimensions; or of stone or concrete not less than four inches in diameter and not less than 24 inches in length. In no case shall thin-wall pipe or electrical conduit be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 68-12, pt. V, § E, 6-3-1968) 
Sec. 70-376. - Grading. 
    Where it is proposed to alter ground elevations more than two feet, proposed, as well as existing, contours shall be shown on the contour map. Where topsoil is removed during the course of grading or construction, it shall be redistributed evenly to a depth of at least four inches. All exposed areas shall be reseeded or sodded to prevent erosion. Seeding and sodding shall conform to the specifications as set forth in article VI of this chapter.

DIVISION 3. - STORM DRAINAGE 

Sec. 70-476. - Facilities required. 
(a)  Stormwater drainage. Adequate facilities shall be provided in all subdivisions and developments for the proper drainage of stormwater runoff from the ground surface. 
(b)  Storm sewers. Storm sewers shall be constructed throughout the entire subdivision which shall be separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system, and which shall provide an adequate outlet or connection to existing stormwater drainage facilities. 
(1)  Storm sewers shall be designed to carry a rate of flow not less than the runoff rate computed by the rational formula modifications of the rational method as follows: 
Q = CIA where 0 = Runoff rate in cubic feet per second A = Tributary drainage area in acres I = Rainfall intensity for a ten-year storm frequency in inches per hour C = Rainfall - runoff coefficient using the following values:  
Surface Type Coefficient Roofs and pavements 0.95 Lawns and unimproved land 0.15  
(2)  The size of storm sewers shall be determined on the basis of the Kutters formula or the Manning formula using an "n" roughness coefficient of 0.013 for smooth pipe and 0.021 for corrugated pipe. 
(c)  Stormwater drainage control regulations. 
(1)  Definitions. When used in subsection (c) of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: 
    By-pass channel means a channel formed in the topography of the earth's surface to carry stormwater runoff through a specific area. 
    Control structure means a structure designed to control the volume of stormwater runoff that passes through it during a specific length of time. 
    Dry bottom stormwater storage area means a facility that is designed to be normally dry and contains water only when excess stormwater runoff occurs. 
    Excess stormwater means that portion of stormwater runoff which exceeds the transportation capacity of storm sewers or natural drainage channels serving a specific watershed. 
    Groundwater recharge means replenishment of existing natural underground water supplies. 
    Natural drainage means channels formed by the existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by unnatural causes. 
    Positive gravity outlet means the drainage of an area by means of natural gravity so that it lowers the free water surface to a point below the existing grade or invert of storm drains within the area. 
    Recognized agency means an agency or governmental unit that has statistically and consistently examined local, climatic and geologic conditions and maintained records as they apply to stormwater runoff, e.g., Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, U.S. Weather Bureau, University Illinois State Water Survey, etc. 
    Safe storm drainage capacity means the quantity of stormwater runoff that can be transported by a channel or conduit without having the water surface rise above the level of the earth's surface over the conduit, or adjacent to the waterway. 
    Stormwater runoff means water that results from precipitation which is not absorbed by the soil or plant material. 
    Stormwater runoff release rate means the rate at which stormwater runoff is released from dominant to servient land. 
    Stormwater storage area means areas designated to store excess stormwater. 
    Tributary watershed means all of the area that contributes stormwater runoff to a given point. 
    Wet bottom stormwater storage area means a facility that is designed to be maintained as free water surface or pond. 
(2)  Land drainage requirements. All land developments and improvements within the jurisdiction and control of the village must have an adequate outlet with safe storm drainage capacity for stormwater drainage as determined by the village engineer. If the stormwater drainage outlet is not adequate, then detention facilities for stormwater runoff shall be provided as determined by the village engineer to store the excess stormwater. A combination of on-site excess stormwater storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be provided for all land uses. A monetary contribution in lieu of detention facilities shall be provided for the following land uses: 
a.  Commercial, institutional, and industrial building developments of two acres and less in area. 
b.  Multiple-family dwelling developments of five acres and less in area. 
c.  Single-family dwelling developments of ten acres and less in area. 
The amount of monetary contribution shall be as set forth in section 32-34. Such contribution shall be made prior to recordation of the final plat or issuance of a building permit. 
Land uses which are larger than those indicated in this subsection may make a monetary contribution in lieu of detention/retention facilities when the proposed land use is upstream of a planned regional detention/retention facility of which this parcel will be serviced. The parcel being serviced as a result of the regional facilities, shall provide a safe and adequate drainage route to the regional facility. The village board of trustees shall approve the method and amount of the contribution. 
(d)  Excess stormwater storage. 
(1)  Dry bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or storm sewer. 
a.  The combination of storage of the water from a 100-year storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 72 hours. 
b.  Maximum depth of planned storm- water storage shall not exceed four feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the village. 
c.  Minimum grades for turf areas shall be two percent and maximum slopes shall be ten percent, ten units horizontally to one unit vertically. Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as practical and ten percent slopes or less shall be used wherever possible. If slopes greater than ten percent are necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be obtained from the village and suitable erosion control provided in addition to the protection required to insure public health, safety, and welfare. 
d.  Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without attention and shall become part of the natural or surface channel system. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to the village engineer to substantiate all design features. Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Stormwater runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum, and turbulent conditions at an outfall control structure will not be permitted without complete protection for the public safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method is feasible. 
(2)  Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed in accordance with all the requirements for dry bottom stormwater storage areas except that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity outlet shall be eliminated. However, the following additional conditions shall be complied with: 
a.  Water surface area shall not exceed ten percent of the tributary drainage area. 
b.  Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action. 
c.  Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of 25 percent of the pond area shall have a minimum depth of ten feet. 
d.  Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. 
e.  Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to the village engineer to substantiate all design features. 
f.  Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the satisfaction of the village. 
g.  In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for purposes of storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the evapotranspiration demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of excess stormwater runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the 100-year storm runoff. 
(3)  Paved surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage areas shall have minimum grades of one percent and shall be restricted to storage depths of one foot maximum. If a portion of an area within a stormwater storage area is to be paved for parking or recreational purposes, the paved surface shall be placed at the highest elevation within the storage area as possible. Maximum parking lot grades shall not exceed normal design parameters of three percent to five percent. 
(e)  Wetland identification. Wetland delineations and impacts shall be permitted through the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission in accordance with the watershed development ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
(f)  Groundwater recharge. The ability to retain and maximize the groundwater recharge capacity of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the stormwater runoff control system shall give consideration to providing groundwater recharge to compensate for the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and roofed over. Specific design calculations and details shall be provided with the final plans and specifications presented for village approval. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of existing topography are examples of possible recharge.

(c)  Petition form and content. The sketch and preliminary plat of vacation shall be accompanied by a certified statement of the assessed valuation of all properties surrounding any public right-of-way to be vacated. Final petitions for vacation shall include the following items: 
(1)  Three copies of the original plat certified by the recorder to be a true copy of the plat, on which is shown the portion to be vacated outlined in a heavy line and hatched; 
(2)  The following deeds, petitions, and certificates, all drafted from models obtainable from the plat officer: 
a.  Deed of vacation. 
b.  Petition, three copies. 
c.  County clerk's certificate. 
d.  Resolution. 
e.  Assessor's certificate. 
(3)  The petition as it is presented to the village board to be accompanied by a recommendation from the plat officer. 
(d)  Easements. The vacation of any plat, or part thereof, or right-of-way, easement, or part thereof, shall not be deemed to be a vacation of the rights of any public utility where such public utility has installed its facilities therein. All such vacations shall be made upon the express condition that the abutting property owner grant to all public utilities, their successors and assigns, the right-of-way or easement to operate, maintain, renew, and reconstruct their facilities, over, or under the public right-of-way or easement vacated and such condition shall be noted on the deed or plat of vacation and in the ordinance or resolution of vacation. 
(e)  Bonds. The village may require the petitioner to furnish bond in an amount sufficient to protect the village, indemnifying it for any suit which may be filed for damages sustained as a result of such vacation. 
(f)  Limitation. Nothing contained in this section, nor any required certificate, shall be deemed in any way to limit the right and authority of the village to vacate any plat or part thereof, or any right-of-way or easement or part thereof where it finds that such vacation will serve the public interest. 
(g)  Resubdivision in lieu of vacation. It shall not be necessary to vacate a plat or part thereof in order to proceed with a resubdivision of such plat or part thereof. Resubdivision according to the procedures and standards for subdivision required by the subdivision regulations shall automatically constitute vacation of a prior plat or part thereof, provided that monetary remuneration shall be paid to the village in consideration of any excess public property vacated over that dedicated in the subdivision. 
(h)  Cancellation of bonded contracts. Bonded contract for the improvement of platted streets or alleys shall be automatically cancelled upon vacation of such platted streets or alleys.

The community and development director shall be authorized to require the submittal of any information otherwise required for a subdivision process and shall be authorized to impose any additional requirements of article VII. The community development director shall have the final decision making authority on consolidations. 
(b)  Consolidation of parcels. A consolidation of parcels shall be required in the following instances when it is necessary to use or maintain the use of any contiguous nonconforming recorded parcel(s) held in common ownership: 
(1)  For construction of a new principal structure, for construction of an addition to an existing structure, or for construction of an accessory structure on the same parcel on which the principal structure exists that will not meet the setback requirement from the common parcel line. 
(2)  For construction of more than one accessory residential building or for construction of an accessory residential building larger than 576 square feet in size or the placement of a new septic system or an addition to an existing septic system. 
(3)  For construction of any new nonresidential accessory building. 
(4)  For receipt of any required building permits from the village for an activity to take place upon all or a portion of the parcels, except for receipt of maintenance and repair permits. 
(5)  Construction of accessory structures such as fences, decks, porches, gazebos, sheds and pools may be exempted from the consolidation requirement. They must meet all other applicable zoning requirements. 
(c)  Required method of consolidation. The following methods shall be used for consolidation under this section 70-546: 
(1)  Partial plat vacation. A consolidation of parcels through plat vacation refers to any required consolidation within the boundaries of a platted subdivision. A consolidation of parcels through partial plat vacation shall require the recordation of a written vacation instrument consistent with sections 6 and 7 of the Illinois Plat Act, 765 ILCS 205/6 and 765 ILCS 205/7. Forms for this instrument are available from the community development department. Through such recorded vacation instrument, the parcels shall be combined. The community director shall have the authority to approve a consolidation of parcels through plat vacation as contemplated in this section and to execute the written vacation instrument on behalf of the village. 
(2)  Covenant. A consolidation of parcels through covenant refers to any required consolidation of metes and bounds parcels, not within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, or the consolidation of one or more metes and bounds parcels with a parcel, located within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, that has been vacated through a written vacation instrument in accordance with subsection (1), above. A consolidation by covenant shall be executed through a signed, notarized and recorded covenant on forms available from the community development department. Through such covenant, the applicant shall agree that all parcels comprising the consolidation of parcels shall remain in common ownership in perpetuity, and shall henceforth be considered one zoning lot for development purposes. Such covenant would be binding on the applicant's successors and assigns. The community development director shall have the authority to approve a consolidation through covenant as contemplated in this subsection and to execute the written covenant instrument on behalf of the village. 
(d)  Public and private rights not affected. Nothing in this section 70-545, shall abridge or destroy any public rights in any streets, alleys, public highways, or public grounds; nor shall anything herein be interpreted as abridging or destroying any covenants, conditions, restrictions, reservations, rights or privileges of the other properties or parties holding any legal interest in, under, or through the terms of the plat. 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § II, 4-12-2004) 
Sec. 70-547. - Fees. 
    The community development director shall establish from time-to-time a reasonable and appropriate filing and processing fee schedule which shall be charged each applicant for consolidation by plat or covenant; such fee schedule shall include all costs of recording instruments with the office of the Lake County Recorder.

(Ord. No. 2009-23, § I, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 71-35. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Prohibition of illicit discharges. 
(1)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drainage system or watercourses any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
(2)  The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited. 
(b)  Exempt discharges. The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: 
(1)  Water line flushing or other potable water sources; landscape irrigation or lawn watering; diverted stream flows; rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems, such as dewatering excavations for foundations or pipelines), crawl space pumps; air conditioning condensation; and springs; noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, water from swimming pools with less than one part per million (PPM) of chlorine, firefighting activities; and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the village as being necessary to protect public health and safety. Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a written notification to the village prior to the time of the test. 
(3)  This prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drainage system. 
(c)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying nonstormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 2009-23, § I, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 4-20-2009) 
Sec. 71-36. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the village.

(2)  Facility operators shall allow the village ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax.

As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission.

(f)  If the owner pays the administrative penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made when the village receives the written waiver.

Article 2. Rules of Measurement & Definitions
b. Building Frontage for Sign Area
Many of the wall sign regulations of this ordinance are based on building
frontage. The following rules govern the measurement of building frontage.
(1) For buildings occupied by a single tenant building frontage is the exterior
building wall (or walls) that: 1) is adjacent to a street or a parking area or
other vehicle circulation area that is accessory to and serves the subject
building and 2) contains either windows or a public building entrance. Allowed
wall sign area for a building that has two or more building frontages must be
calculated on the basis of each individual building frontage.
(2) On buildings housing more than one tenant where each tenant has their own
outside entrance or the tenant space is entered after entering into a vestibule
and where the tenant is on the ground floor and has exterior wall(s), a
tenants building frontage is the exterior building wall (or walls) that directly
abut the tenants interior floor space and that: 1) abuts, parallels, or is the
nearest to parallel with a street or a parking area or other vehicle circulation
area that is accessory to and serves the subject building and 2) contains
either windows or a public building entrance. A tenant that has two or more
building frontages must calculate the permitted sign area on the basis of each
individual building frontage.
Village of Gurnee 2-54 Zoning Ordinance
Article 2. Rules of Measurement & Definitions
3) Regardless of the height, number of stories, or number of tenants in a
building, building frontage will be determined by one measurement of the
horizontal length of the wall at finished grade. Buildings walls must be
measured along a flat, unbroken plane, regardless of the presence of
recesses or projections along the building wall.
(4) As an alternative to the allocation of permitted sign area on the basis of
individual building frontages, a differing allotment of sign area may be
assigned to the various tenants upon receipt and approval by the Zoning
Administrator of written authorization from the owner or authorized
management firm of the building or development. Such written authorization
must be in the form of a master sign plan per Article 13. The master sign
plan is binding upon all new owners and/or authorized management firms of
the building or development.
(5) In no instance may the total combined sign area for all signs exceed the
maximum allowed sign area for the individual building frontages, as
determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 13.
Village of Gurnee 2-55 Zoning Ordinance
Article 2. Rules of Measurement & Definitions
c. Wall Sign Area
The area of a wall is calculated by multiplying the building frontage by the
buildings height or 15 feet, whichever is less.
d. Window Sign Area
The area of a window includes only the glass or glazed elements of the
window. Frames, mullions and similar features are not counted as part of the
window area.

line adjoining a street is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the first
lot to its rear. A reverse corner side setback is the required minimum distance per
the zoning district that a principal building must be located from corner side lot
line. The reverse corner side yard and setback extends along the corner side lot
line between the front yard and the rear lot line, measured perpendicular to the
corner side lot line.
f. Transition Yard. A transition yard is a yard located along an interior side or rear
lot line where a non-residential use abuts a residential use, as specified by the
zoning district in which it is located. When a transition yard is required, the
transition yard replaces the required interior side or rear setback as applicable. In
the case of a corner lot, the transition yard also applies to that part of the corner

Article 3. Zoning Districts
3.1 ZONING MAP
1. Location of Districts
a. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance
are set forth in the Official Zoning Map, as periodically amended. The Official
Zoning Map is incorporated into, and made an integral part of, this Ordinance.
b. It is the intent of this Ordinance that the entire area of the Village, including all
land and water areas, are included in the zoning districts established by this
Ordinance. Any land lying within the Village, but not shown on the Official Zoning
Map as being included within a district, is classified as the R-1 Single-Family
Residential District.
2. Interpretation of Boundary Lines
a. Right-of-Way Lines
Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with streets, highways,
expressways, easements, railroads, or waterways (streams, rivers, canals, lakes,
or other bodies of water), the boundary line is construed to be the centerline of
the right-of-way.
b. Property Lines
Where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a recorded property line, the
property line is construed to be the boundary line of the district.
c. Scaled Lines
Where the district boundary lines do not coincide with a right-of-way line or
recorded property line, the district boundary is determined by measuring such
boundary line(s) by using the map scale as provided on the Official Zoning Map.
d. Clarification of Boundary Lines
The Planning and Zoning Board will decide any interpretations of zoning district
boundary lines, where the application of Paragraphs 1 through 3 above leaves
doubt as to the boundary between two zoning districts.
3.2 ANNEXED LAND
Any territory annexed into the Village is automatically, upon annexation, zoned as the R-
1 Single-Family Residential District, unless otherwise provided for in the annexation
agreement or until the territory is rezoned.

1. R-1 Single-Family Residential District
The R-1 Single-Family Residential District is intended for a low density, semi-rural
environment of detached single-family dwellings sited on relatively large lots. Limited
non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding residential
neighborhoods, may be permitted.
2. R-2 Single-Family Residential District
The R-2 Single-Family Residential District is intended for areas of moderate density
development and function as a transitional zone between areas of semi-rural character
and developed residential districts. The R-2 District accommodates detached singlefamily
dwellings on relatively large lots that are serviced by community sewer and
water, which is a prerequisite for development. Limited non-residential uses, which are
compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be permitted.
3. R-3 Single-Family Residential District
The R-3 Single-Family Residential District is intended for detached single-family
dwellings sited on moderately-sized lots. Many of the Villages older residential
neighborhoods are zoned the R-3 District, so the dimensional standards seek to
preserve the established residential form and character. Limited non-residential uses,
which are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be permitted.
4. R-4 Two-Family Residential District
The R-4 Two-Family Residential District is intended for areas of detached single-family
and two-family dwellings and serves as a transition between the lower density singlefamily
neighborhoods and higher density multi-family neighborhoods and certain nonresidential
areas. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible with surrounding
residential neighborhoods, may be permitted.
Village of Gurnee 42 Zoning Ordinance
Article 4. Residential Districts
5. R-5 Limited Multi-Family Residential District
The R-5 Limited Multi-Family Residential District accommodates a variety of residential
structures, such as detached single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, and
townhouses, and other multi-family housing. The R-5 District is intended only for areas
where adequate public utilities and other infrastructure exists that can serve higher
density development, as well as where such development will not negatively impact
lower density residential neighborhoods. Limited non-residential uses, which are
compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be permitted.
6. R-6 Multi-Family Residential District
The R-6 Multi-Family Residential District accommodates high-density residential
development, primarily townhouses and multi-family dwellings. The R-6 District
functions as a transition between residential neighborhoods and commercial areas or
major arterial roadways. The R-6 District is intended only for areas where adequate
public utilities and other infrastructure exists that can serve higher density
development, as well as where such development will not negatively impact lower
density residential neighborhoods. Limited non-residential uses, which are compatible
with surrounding residential neighborhoods, may be permitted.

9.0 PURPOSE
Planned unit developments (PUD) are included in this Ordinance as a distinct category of
special use. In particular, however, the planned unit development technique is intended to
encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land than is possible
under district zoning regulations and should only be applied to further those applications
that provide special, compensating amenities to the Village. Through the flexibility of the
planned unit development technique, the planned unit development must accomplish the
following objectives:
a. Encourage flexibility in the development of land and in the design of structures.
b. Encourage planned diversification in the location of structures.
c. Encourage a creative approach to the use of land that results in better development
and design than might otherwise be accomplished under the strict application of other
sections of this Ordinance.
d. Allow for the design of developments that are architecturally and environmentally
innovative, and that achieve better utilization of land than is possible through strict
application of standard zoning and subdivision controls.
e. Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and structural/visual
relationships within an environment that allows mixing of different land uses in an
innovative and functionally efficient manner.
f. Provide for the efficient use of land to facilitate a more effective arrangement of land
uses, structures, circulation patterns, and utilities.
g. Encourage land development that, to the greatest extent possible, preserves natural
vegetation, respects natural topographic and geologic conditions, and refrains from
adversely effecting flooding, soil, drainage, and other natural ecologic conditions.
h. Provide for more usable and suitably located open space and recreation areas than
might otherwise be provided under the application of other articles of this Ordinance.
i. Encourage the construction of appropriate aesthetic amenities that will enhance the
character of the site.

ownership or under unified control to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a
unified whole. All owners of the property must be included as joint applicants on all
applications and all approvals will bind all owners. The violation of any owner as to any
tract is deemed a violation to all owners.
9.2 AUTHORIZATION
A planned unit development may be authorized as a special use in all zoning districts. A
planned unit development must be granted in accordance with the procedures and
standards of this article, and the special use provisions of Section 16.0 (Special Use).
Unless specifically approved by the ordinance granting or amending the planned unit
development as a special use, the requirements of the underlying district apply. The
ordinance granting or amending the planned unit development as a special use may
depart from the normal procedures, standards and other requirements of this Ordinance.
9.3 EXCEPTIONS FROM DISTRICT REGULATIONS
a. The planned unit development is subject to the underlying district regulations unless
an exception is specifically granted. The Planning and Zoning Board may
recommend and the Village Board may grant exceptions to the zoning district use,
dimension, and bulk regulations where a planned unit development is located.
Exceptions from district regulations may be granted for planned unit developments, if
the Village Board finds that such exceptions:
(1) Enhance the overall merit of the planned unit development.
(2) Promote the objectives of both the Village and the development.
(3) Enhance the quality of the design of the structures and the site plan.
(4) Enable the development to offer environmental and pedestrian amenities.

Village Board must make findings to support the special use standards of Section
16.0 (Special Use), as well as each of the following for planned unit
developments:
(1) The proposed planned unit development will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the vicinity for the purposes already permitted.
(2) The proposed planned unit development will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the zoning district.
Village of Gurnee 96 Zoning Ordinance
Article 9. Planned Unit Developments
(3) There is provision for adequate utilities, drainage, off-street parking and
loading, pedestrian access, and all other necessary facilities.
(4) There is provision for adequate vehicular ingress and egress designed to
minimize traffic congestion upon public streets.
(5) The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting
and appurtenant facilities, are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood
and adjacent land uses.
(6) The area of the proposed planned unit development that is not to be used for
structures, parking and loading areas, or access ways, is suitably
landscaped.
(7) The planned unit development preserves unusual topographic or natural
features of the land.
e. Expiration
(1) The preliminary plan approval expires if a complete application for approval of
a final plan has not been filed within four years after the date the Village
Board grants preliminary plan approval. As part of the Village Board approval
of the preliminary plan, the Village Board may extend this period of time. An
extension of this four year validity period may also be granted by the Village
Board if the applicant requests an extension in writing prior to the expiration
date of the approval. A public hearing for an extension of time of a preliminary
plan is not required.
(2) If a map amendment was approved as part of the planned unit development
approval, once the preliminary plan has expired and no request for extension is
pending, the Village Board may initiate a map amendment to rezone the
property to its most appropriate district classification, as deemed suitable by
the Village Board, acting on the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Board.
3. Final Plan
Following the approval of the preliminary plan, an application for a final plan for a
planned unit development must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within four
years, unless an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant and Village Board.
All applications must be filed in accordance with the requirements in Section 15.0
(Application) and the submittal requirements of this Section 9.5 below.
a. Action by Zoning Administrator
The Zoning Administrator will review the final plan within 30 days of receipt of the
complete final plan application and take the following action:
Village of Gurnee 97 Zoning Ordinance
Article 9. Planned Unit Developments
(1) If the final plan is in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, the
Zoning Administrator will recommend approval of the final plan to the Village
Board. The Zoning Administrator will certify to the Village Board that the Final
Plan is in substantial conformance with the previously filed Preliminary Plan.
(2) If the final plan is not in substantial conformance with the preliminary plan, the
Zoning Administrator must inform the applicant as to specific areas found not
to be in compliance, and the applicant must resubmit the final plan to the
Zoning Administrator with changes to those areas found not to be in
substantial compliance. If the revised final plan remains noncompliant with
the preliminary plan, the applicant may request that the Zoning Administrator
render a decision to be forwarded to the Village Board. In such case, the
Zoning Administrator will recommend to the Village Board that the final plan
be denied. If denied, the applicant may reapply by submitting a new
preliminary plan.
b. Action by Village Board
Within 60 days of receipt of the Zoning Administrators recommendation, the
Village Board must review the final plan. The Village Board must approve or deny
the final plan. If denied, the applicant may reapply by submitting a new final plan.
c. Effect of Approval
After final plan approval, the final plan will constitute the development regulations
applicable to the subject property and must be recorded by the Lake County
Recorder of Deeds. The planned unit development must be developed in
accordance with the final plan, rather than the zoning district regulations
otherwise applicable to such property. Violation of any condition is a violation of
this Ordinance and constitutes grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for
the planned unit development.
d. Expiration
(1) The final plan approval expires if a building permit has not been issued within
two years after the date the Village Board grants final plan approval. As part
of the Village Board approval of the final plan, the Village Board may extend
this period of time. An extension of this two year validity period may be
granted by the Village Board prior to the expiration date of the approval if the
applicant requests an extension in writing prior to the expiration date of the
approval.
(2) If a map amendment was approved as part of the planned unit development
approval, once the final plan has expired and no request for extension is
pending, the Village Board may initiate a map amendment to rezone the lot to
its most appropriate district classification, as deemed suitable by the Village
Board, acting on the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board.

10.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Number of Structures on a Lot
In the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Districts there must be no more than one principal
building per lot. In all other districts, more than one principal building is permitted on
a lot, provided that each complies with all bulk and yard requirements of a district as
though it were a principal building on an individual lot.
2. All Activities within an Enclosed Structure
Within all districts, all activities must be conducted entirely within an enclosed
structure, with the exception of the following activities and uses:
a. Parking lots, principal and ancillary.
b. Businesses with a permitted outdoor component, including, but not limited to,
outdoor recreation, outdoor storage yards, contractor storage yards, outdoor
dining, car washes, kennels, animal care facilities, and similar businesses.
However, these businesses may be limited or the outdoor components prohibited
as a condition of a special use, when special use approval is applicable.
c. Permitted outdoor storage, and outdoor sales, and display areas.
d. Permitted outdoor temporary uses.
3. Frontage on a Public or Private Street

highway (i.e., tollway) does not satisfy this requirement.
4. Required Setbacks
No lot may be reduced in area so that the setbacks are less than required by this
Ordinance. The required setbacks for a lot cannot be considered a setback for any
other lot. No principal building or accessory structure may be located in a required
setback unless permitted by this Ordinance under Sections 10.2 (Accessory
Structures and Uses) and 10.3 (Permitted Encroachments).
Village of Gurnee 102 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
5. Applicability of Bulk Requirements
All structures erected after the effective date of this Ordinance must meet the
dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the structure is located. No
existing structure may be enlarged, altered, reconstructed, or relocated in such a
manner that conflicts with the requirements of the district in which the structure it is
located.
6. Applicability of Use Restrictions
No structure or land may be used for any use other than one allowed as either a
permitted or special use in the zoning district in which such structure or land is
located. Structures or land may also be used for a temporary use or accessory use,
in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 and Sections 10.2 (Accessory
Structures and Uses) and 10.3 (Permitted Encroachments).
7. Sight Triangle
All structures, including a closed fence or wall, and all plantings are limited to a
maximum height of three feet within the sight triangle. A semi-open fence that
complies with all fence requirements that does not impair the sight triangle is
permitted.
10.1 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
1. Purpose
Exterior lighting is used to illuminate uses, parking lots, sidewalks, signs, and other
elements within the Village. When well designed and properly installed, exterior
lighting improves visibility and safety, provides a sense of security, and complements
the character of the Village. Conversely, if poorly designed and improperly installed,
it can be inefficient, cause glare, and create light trespass and sky glow. Light
trespass falling over property lines can illuminate adjacent structures, uses, and land
in an objectionable manner. In order to ensure that exterior lighting is well designed,
and impacts on adjacent properties are controlled, the following requirements control
exterior lighting in the Villages zoning districts.
2. Lighting Plan Required
a. A lighting plan is required for all non-residential uses in residential zoning
districts, multi-family dwellings, and commercial, industrial, institutional, and
public uses, including uses developed by other units of local government. Singlefamily
and two-family dwellings are specifically exempt from a required lighting
plan but are still subject to the applicable lighting requirements.
b. When any exterior lighting is installed or substantially modified, which means
25% of the illumination system is to be replaced or modified, calculated as
installation of new lighting posts and/or non-post mounted lighting fixtures, or as
otherwise determined by the Zoning Administrator, a lighting plan must be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator to determine if the requirements of this
Village of Gurnee 103 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
section have been met. A lighting plan is also required for, planned unit
developments and requests for variations from the standards imposed in this
Section.
c. A lighting plan must include the following:
(1) A site plan showing all light pole locations, building-mounted lights, bollard
lights, canopy lights, and all other lighting, with schematic wiring layout and
power source connection indicated.
(2) Specifications for luminaires and lamp types, poles, wiring, conduit, and
appurtenant construction, including photographs or drawings of proposed
luminaires.
(3) Pole, luminaire, and foundation details including pole height, pole base
height, height of building-mounted lights, mounting height, and height of the
luminaire.
(4) Elevations of the site including all structures and luminaires sufficient to
determine the total cutoff angle of all luminaires and their relationship to
abutting parcels.
(5) Lamp wattage of all proposed luminaires and light source.
(6) Photometric plans that show the footcandle-horizontal measurement internal
to the site and at all lot lines.
(7) Other information and data reasonably necessary to evaluate the required
lighting plan pursuant to the request of the Office of the Zoning Administrator.
3. Lighting Standards
a. Application of Tables 10-1 and 10-2
(1) The standards and requirements of Tables 10-1: Lighting Standards A
and 10-2: Lighting Standards B regulate and govern the use of, design of,
construction or modification of any lighting system for the purpose of
illuminating exterior areas including, but not limited to, signs, parking
areas, buildings, landscape, porches, and driveways. Table 10-1 does not
apply to LED lighting.
(2) Table 10-1 describes whether the proposed wattage of a luminaire is
permitted, prohibited, or a special use. In residential zoning districts,
whether a specified wattage is permitted or prohibited is based on the
width of the street right-of-way abutting the proposed luminaire. In nonresidential
zoning districts, the permitted wattage of proposed exterior
lighting is based on whether the lighting is internal or external on the
parcel, and if external (abutting a residential zoning district or street rightof-
way), the setback of the proposed lighting from the lot line.
Village of Gurnee 104 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
(3) Table 10-2 describes the maximum allowable footcandles to be measured
internal to a non-residential property. The standards consider the nature
of the use, the nature of the abutting uses, and whether the time period is
during hours of operation or security hours. Maximum footcandles
allowable are set for lighting internal to the property in question.
(4) The maximum allowable footcandle at the lot line, whether residential or
non-residential, is one footcandle, with the exception of non-residential
uses that abut another non-residential use where the maximum allowable
footcandle at the lot line is five.
(5) Uses permitted by-right may be approved by the Zoning Administrator
pending a review of the lighting plan. When a use or lighting plan requires
a special use, the special use approval process of Section 16.1 applies.
(6) Lighting plans that exceed these lighting standards must be approved for
a variation. However, additional security lighting in excess of that allowed
by the Table 10-2 may be allowed by the Zoning Administrator without a
variation when additional security measures are required for security
reasons.

b. Standards for Luminaire with Cutoffs
(1) Cutoff Angle
To be considered a cutoff luminaire, the cutoff angle must be 75 degrees
or less. A luminaire is considered to have no cutoff if it is unshielded, or
has a cutoff angle greater than 75 degrees, acknowledging that limited
light trespass will occur.
(2) Height
(a) The maximum height of a freestanding cutoff luminaire is 25 feet as a
permitted use. A freestanding cutoff luminaire height greater than 25
feet require special use approval.
(b) The maximum height of a cutoff luminaire attached to a structure is 25
feet, except that such fixture less than or equal to 100 watts and
below the roofline can extend above this height as a permitted use. A
wall-mounted cutoff luminaire height greater than 25 feet requires and
greater than 100 watts requires special use approval.
Village of Gurnee 106 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
(3) Control of Glare
(a) A cutoff luminaire must be designed to completely shield the light
source from an observer three and one-half feet above the ground at
any point along an abutting property line.
(b) Within the residential districts, no glare onto adjacent properties is
permitted.
c. Standards for Luminaire with No Cutoffs
(1) Cutoff Angle
A luminaire is considered to have no cutoff if it is unshielded or has a
cutoff angle greater than 75 degrees.
(2) Height
The maximum permitted height of a luminaire with no cutoff or with a
cutoff greater than 75 degrees, which provides illumination along a lot
line, must be less than the value 3 feet + (D/3), where D is the distance
in feet to the nearest lot line but in no case must exceed 16 feet. The
formula used for determining height of the luminaire does not preclude
any luminaire or lighting system from meeting the footcandle performance
standards set forth in Table 10-2.
(3) Control of Glare
(a) Any luminaire designed with no cutoff or a cutoff angle greater than 75
degrees must be designed so that the lamp utilized is no more than
100 watts or rated for more than 10,000 lumens, whichever is less.
The standards for maximum footcandles internal and at the property
line, set forth in Table 10-2, are still applicable
Village of Gurnee 107 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
(b) Within the residential districts, no glare onto adjacent properties is
permitted.
d. Standards for Luminaires for a Canopy for Non-Residential Uses
(1) Luminaires mounted to the underside of a canopy, which provide
overhead illumination, must be recessed such that no part of the
luminaire or the lamp extends below the housing unit.
(2) The lighting standards of Table 10-2 are modified for gas station
canopies. Under canopy lighting is permitted a maximum footcandle of
35. Footcandles greater than 35 and up to 50 are a special use.
Footcandles above 50 require a variation.
(3) Gas station canopies are permitted an illuminated band along the edge of
the canopy. Use of exposed neon or LED as the means of illumination is
allowed only by special use permit. The illuminated band is limited to 15%
of the overall height of the edge of the canopy and is not counted as a
sign unless there is a commercial message associated with the band; in
that case, only the commercial message portion is calculated as a sign.
(4) The lighting standards of Table 10-2 are modified for non-gas station
canopies. Under canopy lighting is permitted a maximum footcandle of
25. Footcandles greater than 25 and up to 50 are a special use.
Footcandles above 50 require a variation.
4. Exceptions to Lighting Standards
a. Public Roadway Lighting
Luminaires used for public roadway illumination by a public transportation
agency are exempt from the requirements of this section, but may be subject
to the regulations of federal or state agencies or by other intergovernmental
agreements.
b. Emergency Lighting
All temporary emergency lighting needed by the Police or Fire Departments
or other emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaires, are exempt
from the requirements of this section.
c. Recreational Facilities
Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility and their limited
hours of operation, outdoor recreational facilities (public or private) such as,
but not limited to, football fields, soccer fields, baseball fields, softball fields,
tennis courts, golf driving ranges, show areas, and other similar uses are
exempt from the following standards:
Village of Gurnee 108 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
(1) Recreational facilities are exempt from the maximum footcandle
requirements internal to the site, as described in Table 10-2. These uses
are required to submit a lighting plan and must be approved as a special
use. Recreational facilities must meet the requirements for maximum
footcandles at the property line or apply for a variation if they are unable
to meet those requirements.
(2) Recreational facilities are exempt from the height requirements set forth
in this section. Proposed pole heights will be reviewed and approved
during the special use permit review process.
d. Temporary Uses
Certain temporary uses may be unable to meet the requirements of this
section. When such temporary uses are permitted, approval of all lighting is
required by the Zoning Administrator. The applicant for a temporary use
permit may be required to submit a lighting plan as a part of the temporary
use permit application (Section 16.4).
5. Prohibited Lighting
a. Flickering or flashing lights are prohibited unless authorized in a lighting plan
approved as a special use or planned unit development.

structures may also be prohibited in certain yards. Required setbacks are
described in the district standards. The use of the term yard refers to the area
between the building line and the lot line. The distinction is made because certain
principal buildings may be set back further than required by district setback
standards, thereby creating a yard larger than the minimum setback dimension. If
a structure is permitted within a yard, it is permitted within the required setback
subject to any additional limitations.

structure and installed primarily for the production and consumption of
energy on the parcel upon which it is installed. Energy produced in
excess of consumption may be sold back to the electric utility service
provider that serves the proposed site for use with the existing energy
grid.
(2) Wind energy systems must be installed according to manufacturer
specifications and in accordance with all applicable codes and
ordinances.
Village of Gurnee 1030 Zoning Ordinance
Article 10. Site Development Standards
(3) Wind energy systems must be finished in a neutral color that is flat or
matte, so as to reduce incidence of sun glint. The required coloration and
finish must be maintained throughout the life of the system.
(4) No wind energy system may have any advertising material, writing,
picture, or sign, other than warning(s), turbine tower identification, or
manufacturer or ownership information. This prohibition includes the
attachment of any flag, decorative sign, streamers, pennants, ribbons,
spinners or waiving, fluttering or revolving devices, but not including
meteorological/weather devices or warning signs.
(5) All wiring between a wind energy system and a principal and/or accessory
structure must be underground. However, if the wiring cannot be placed
underground, it must be contained within conduit which matches the
principal building and must conform to all Village Codes.
(6) The wind energy system must not be artificially lighted unless required by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or as necessary for the safety
of personnel performing maintenance of, or repairs to the facilities. Any
such artificial lighting must be shielded so that no glare extends
substantially beyond the property lines of the property on which the facility
is located.
(7) Wind energy systems must be maintained in operational condition at all
times, except for reasonable maintenance and repair outages. Should a
wind energy system become inoperable, or should any part of the system
become damaged, or should a system violate the ordinance, the owner
must cease operations immediately and remedy the condition promptly.

(a) For adjacent non-participating properties used or zoned for residential
purposes, the average sound level must not exceed 55 dB(A) during
daytime hours and 45 dB(A) during nighttime hours at any point as
measured at the property line, unless otherwise allowed by this
section.
(b) For adjacent non-participating properties used or zoned for nonresidential
purposes, the average sound level must not exceed 65
dB(A) at any time of the day as measured at the property line, unless
otherwise allowed by this section.
(c) If the non-operational ambient sound level is greater than the
maximum sound levels of this section, this non-operational ambient
sound level will be the maximum sound level permitted.

Article 10. Site Development Standards
(d) No wind energy system may operate with an average sound level
more than 5 dB(A) above the non-operational ambient level, as
measured at the property line of any neighboring residentially zoned
or used property. Additionally, to limit the level of low-frequency
sound, the average C-weighted sound level during operation must not
exceed the A-weighted ambient sound level by more than 20 dB.
(e) The Village may require, at the owners expense, field tests or sound
propagation modeling, conducted by or supervised by an acoustics
specialist to determine whether a violation of said sound regulations is
occurring or has occurred. The owner must immediately remedy any
such violations or discontinue operation.
(10) Any wind energy system which exceeds the permitted standards of this
section requires special use permit approval. The following additional
documentation is required:
(a) A certificate of height necessity is required when an applicant is
requesting a wind energy system with height greater than is permitted
by this section. A written statement from a licensed engineer must
confirm that the additional height requested is the minimum necessary
to accomplish the applicants purpose and unless granted, the wind to
be received by this system will be substantially impaired or obstructed
within the selected installation area. This documentation also must
include the location and height of the obstructing structures or
vegetation which are obstructing the laminar flow of the wind.
(b) A shadow flicker study that illustrates that a wind energy system
facility is sited such that shadow flicker will not fall on any existing
residential nonparticipating property line within 500 feet of the system
for more than 50 hours in a calendar year.
(c) Documentation that states that the proposed wind energy system
complies with FAA regulations. If the SWES is not regulated by the
FAA, documentation must be provided stating the FAA has no
regulations.
(11) When a wind energy system has become inoperable, damaged, or
otherwise violates the operating requirements for a continuous period of
12 months or more, the system is deemed to be abandoned. The owner
must remove such items within 90 days of written notice, with such notice
sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the
Village to such owner at the last known address of such owner. If such
abandoned facility is not completely removed within the required
timeframe, the Village may remove all structures at the owners expense.
In the case of such removal, the Village has the right to file a lien for
reimbursement, for any and all expenses incurred without limitation,
including attorney fees and accrued interest. Upon removal, the site must
be restored to its original pre-construction condition for a wind energy
system as referenced with photos presented as part of the project permit.

is limited to a maximum width as follows:
a. One car garage: 14 feet
b. Two car garage: 16 feet
c. Three or more car garage: 18 feet
For the purpose of this provision, 9 feet of garage width is required per
garage space. A driveway apron, the width of the garage or carport, plus an
additional 18 inches on both sides of the garage walls, is permitted to extend
for a distance (depth) of 20 feet back from the garage doors or carport
entrance before tapering back to the maximum driveway width to allow
access to the additional spaces. Such taper must not exceed a 45 degree
angle.
(2) A residential driveway that provides access to an attached garage shall be no
wider than the width of the garage plus an additional 18 inches on both sides
of the garage walls or 24 feet, whichever is less. Where the attached garage
is wider than 24 feet, a driveway apron, the width of the garage plus an
additional 18 inches on both sides of the garage walls, is permitted to extend
for a distance (depth) of 20 feet back from the garage doors before tapering
back to the maximum driveway width to allow access to the additional
spaces. Such taper must not exceed a 45 degree angle.
(3) Driveways must be located a minimum of one foot from a lot line.
(4) For driveways with two curb cuts (U-shaped driveways), the portion of the
driveway providing the most direct access from the public right-of-way or
private street or access drive to the garage must adhere to the standards for
driveways leading to attached or detached garages. Any section of the UVillage
of Gurnee 11-8 Zoning Ordinance
Article 11. Off-Street Parking & Loading
shaped driveway other than this portion is limited to 12 feet in width. In
addition, lots with U-shaped driveways are not allowed a parking pad in the
front yard.

surfaced, all-weather dustless material. Pervious paving may also be used,
however gravel is prohibited.
b. For single-family and two-family dwellings, a parking space may consist of two
parallel paved parking strips, each of which is at least 18 inches in width and 18
feet long. Gravel and wood chips are prohibited as fill material between the parking
strips.
Village of Gurnee 11-9 Zoning Ordinance
Article 11. Off-Street Parking & Loading
5. Striping
Off-street parking lots of four or more spaces must delineate parking spaces with
paint or other permanent materials, which must be maintained in clearly visible
condition.
6. Wheel Stops and Curbing
Wheel stops or curbing must be installed along the perimeter of parking lots to
prevent vehicles from damaging or encroaching upon any adjacent parking space,
sidewalk, landscape, fence, wall, or structure. Such wheel stops or curbing must be
constructed of permanent materials, such as concrete, masonry, or steel, a minimum
height of four inches above ground level, and permanently affixed to the paved
parking area.
7. Lighting

Village of Gurnee 11-10 Zoning Ordinance
Article 11. Off-Street Parking & Loading
9. Use of Parking and Loading Spaces
All required parking and loading spaces must be used for vehicle parking and
loading, as applicable. No required space may be used for storage or vehicle repair.
11.3 REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES
1. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for the designated
uses shall be as follows in Table 11-2: Off-Street Parking Requirements. Table 11-2
lists parking requirements for the uses listed within the districts. In some cases, uses
which are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specified parking
requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and
do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district.
2. Certain uses listed within the districts do not have parking requirements. These types
of uses are not listed within Table 11-2.
3. The Planning and Zoning Board may authorize a modification, reduction, or waiver of
these requirements, if it finds that, in the particular case, the peculiar nature of the
use, the exceptional shape or size of the property, or other exceptional situation or
condition would justify such action.
4. The total number of required parking spaces is calculated by the principal use of the
lot. When more than one use occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces
is the sum of the separate requirements for each use, unless a shared parking
arrangement is approved or such use is a multi-tenant retail center, which has a
separate requirement. The following standards for computation shall apply:
a. Spaces allocated to any off-street loading space may not be used to satisfy the
requirement for any required off-street parking space or access aisle, or portion
thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any required off-street parking space
may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any required off-street loading
space or portion thereof.
b. When calculating the number of required off-street spaces results in a
requirement of a fractional space, said fraction is rounded up.
c. In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or
similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating facility shall be counted as
one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-street parking
facilities. Floor area of a prayer hall is counted as one seat per marked prayer mat
space or one seat for every five square feet in the prayer hall if prayer mat spaces
are not marked.
d. Required parking in the C-6 District is calculated as follows:
(1) Five spaces per 1,000 square feet of net floor area, except offices,
hotels/motels, and freestanding restaurants, which must meet the
requirements of Table 11-2.
Village of Gurnee 11-11 Zoning Ordinance
Article 11. Off-Street Parking & Loading
(2) Subject to Zoning Administrator approval, only 80% of the required parking
need be provided on the lot or building parcel on which any specific use is
located so long as the remainder of the required parking is located within 400
feet walking distance from such lot or building parcel and the overall parking
ratio is not reduced below that required.
e. Parking in the EGG Overlay District is required as follows:
(1) If a lot with an existing structure designates and records an area on the lot for
a cross-access easement, the parking existing on the site as of the effective
date of this Ordinance is deemed conforming. When an adjacent lot
designates an area for cross-access, such cross-access must be established.
(2) If a lot is redeveloped (i.e., the principal structure is demolished) and an area
on the lot is designated and recorded for a cross-access easement, such lot
is granted a 30% reduction in the required parking. When an adjacent lot
designates an area for cross-access, such cross-access must be established.
(3) If a lot with an existing structure does not provide for a cross-access
easement, parking must be provided as required by this Article. If a lot is
redeveloped and does not provide for a cross-access easement, parking
must be provided as required by this Article.
f. With the exception of single-family, two-family, and townhouse dwellings, parking
spaces for disabled persons must be provided. The number of accessible parking
spaces must be included in the total number of required parking spaces and in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Accessibility Code, as
amended from time to time, and any additional governing codes and applicable
laws.

Within the non-residential districts, off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be
provided collectively by shared parking. The number of spaces required is calculated by
the Zoning Administrator using the calculations within the Urban Land Institute Shared
Parking publication (second edition). Specifically, Table 2-2 (Summary of
Recommended Base Parking Ratios), Table 2-5 (Recommended Time-of-Day Factors
for Weekends), and Table 2-6 (Recommended Time-of-Day Factors for Weekdays) will
be used to calculate the required parking.
11.5 LAND-BANKED PARKING PERMISSION

3. Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans
Minor changes to the landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net
amount of plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan may be
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Changes to the amount of plant materials of
an approved landscape plan are not considered a minor change. Major changes
must be approved by the body granting approval of the landscape plan initially.
Village of Gurnee 12 2 Zoning Ordinance
Article 12. Landscape & Screening
12.1 ENFORCEMENT OF LANDSCAPE PLAN
1. No certificate of occupancy will be issued until all the requirements of this Article and
the landscape plan have been fulfilled. Failure to implement the landscape plan, or to
maintain the lot in conformance with the landscape plan, may result in the application
of fines and penalties, as established in the Gurnee Municipal Code. All landscape is
subject to periodic inspection.
2. If weather prohibits the installation of landscape at the time a certificate of occupancy
is applied for, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a six month
period with provision of a security bond or security for 115% of the estimated
amount, including installation.
12.2 SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE
1. Selection
All plant materials must be of good quality and meet American Association of
Nurserymen (AAN) standards for minimum acceptable form, quality and size (unless
specified differently by this section) for species selected, and capable to withstand
the seasonal temperature variations of northeastern Illinois, as well as the individual
site microclimate. The use of species native or naturalized to northeastern Illinois is
encouraged. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at
maturity, are additional criteria that must be considered when selecting plant
material. Where appropriate, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is
preferred.
2. Installation
All landscape materials must be installed in accordance with the current planting
procedures established by the AAN. All plant materials must be free of disease and
installed so that soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are
available to sustain healthy growth. Installation of plant materials during the
appropriate growing season is encouraged.
3. Maintenance
a. Landscape materials depicted on approved landscape plans is considered a
required site element in the same manner as structures, required parking,
lighting, and other improvements. As such, the owner of record or the business
or homeowners association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and
replacement of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls, and similar
landscape elements.
b. All landscape materials must be maintained in good condition, present a healthy,
neat and orderly appearance, and kept free of refuse and debris. Any dead,
unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within 60 days of notification by
the Zoning Administrator, unless an extension is permitted by the Zoning
Administrator.
Village of Gurnee 12 3 Zoning Ordinance
Article 12. Landscape & Screening
12.3 LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS
1. Minimum Planting Sizes
a. Shade trees must have a minimum trunk size of three inches in caliper at
planting.
b. Evergreens trees must have a minimum height of six feet at planting.
c. Single stem ornamental trees must have a minimum trunk size of three inches in
caliper at planting. Multiple stem ornamental trees must have a minimum height
of eight feet at planting.
d. Large deciduous and evergreen shrubs must have minimum height of three feet
at installation. Small deciduous and evergreen shrubs must have a minimum
height of 18 inches at installation. Large shrubs are those shrubs that reach five
or more feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs are those shrubs that may grow
up to five feet in height if left unmaintained, but are generally maintained at
heights of eighteen 18 to 30 inches.
2. Energy Conservation
Plant material placement should be designed to reduce the energy consumption
needs of the development.
a. Deciduous trees should be encouraged on the south and west sides of buildings
to provide shade from the summer sun.
b. Evergreens and other plant materials should be encouraged on the north and
west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
3. Tree Species Diversity
Diversity among required trees is required for visual interest and to reduce the risk of
losing a large population of trees due to disease. Table 12-1: Tree Diversity
Requirements indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total
quantity of tree species being used. For example, if a development requires 45
shade trees, no more than 18 trees (40%) and no less than five trees (10%) can be
of one species, and there must be a minimum of five different species within the 45
trees. When the calculation of plant diversity requirements results in a fraction, said
fraction is rounded up.

4. Berming
Earthen berms and existing topographic features may be incorporated into the
landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient space and, in particular, when
berms and existing topographic features can be combined with plant material to
facilitate effective screening. Minimum unretained berm side slopes must be
maintained at no steeper than a 4:1 slope ratio to prevent erosion and be properly
and safely maintained, unless a steeper slope is allowed by the Zoning Administrator
or other sections of this Ordinance. Retained slopes may be implemented with the
appropriate terracing necessary to reduce the need for safety railing.
12.4 REQUIRED SETBACK LANDSCAPE
1. General Requirements
a. All portions of a lot not covered by structures or paved surfaces must be
landscaped with trees, shrubbery, live groundcover, and other plantings.
b. All existing plantings that are maintained on a site may be counted toward
required on-site landscape.
2. Required Front and Corner Side Setback Landscape
Where a townhouse development, multi-family dwelling, or non-residential use,
including mixed-use development, maintains a front or corner side setback between
the structure and the lot line of ten feet or more in depth, landscape is required. This
does not apply to parking lots or any areas designed as outdoor dining, seating, or
plaza areas. In the case of conflict with parking lot landscape requirements, the
parking lot landscape requirements control. The C-5 and C-6 Districts are subject to
these requirements, unless a different standard is specified within the district
regulations (Article 5) for the C-5 and C-6 Districts.
a. Five plant unit options are provided in Table 12-2: Plant Unit Options. Any plant
unit option or combination plant unit options may be used. Plantings may be
spaced or clustered as needed to respond to specific site conditions.
Village of Gurnee 12 5 Zoning Ordinance
Article 12. Landscape & Screening
b. One plant unit option is required per each 100 linear feet. When the yard is less
than 100 linear feet or when additional linear feet above the first 100 feet are less
than 100 feet, percentages based on that linear footage are allowed to reduce
the amount of plant material required. (For example, if the linear footage is 25
feet, only 25% of the plantings required by a plant unit option are required.)
When the calculation of plant unit option requirements results in a fraction, said
fraction is rounded up.
c. Shrubs may be substituted for required trees in the amounts described in this
section. However, no more than 25% of required trees may be substituted by
shrubs.
(1) One Shade Tree: 15 Shrubs
(2) One Evergreen Tree: 10 Shrubs
(3) One Ornamental Tree: 5 Shrubs
d. Use of rocks or mulch in lieu of live groundcover plantings may not exceed 20%
of the total landscape yard, excluding driveways, walkways, or other access
points. Bare earth is prohibited.
e. The native landscape option does not require set planting numbers of trees and
shrubs, but must cover the entire landscape yard area. All plantings must be
native or naturalized to northeastern Illinois. Rain gardens, bioswales, and similar
stormwater management landscape techniques also meet this requirement.
f. A wet bottom or wetland bottom detention pond only is permitted in a front or
corner side setback in lieu of these requirements. All detention ponds must be
designed in accordance with Section 10.2.7.

3. Required Rear and Interior Side Setback Buffer Yard Landscape
This section establishes standards for the dimension and required landscape for
buffer yard plantings within the rear or interior side setback. The C-5 and C-6
Districts are subject to these requirements, unless a different standard is specified
within the district regulations (Article 5) for the C-5 and C-6 Districts.
a. Buffer yards are located within required rear or interior side setbacks and must
be reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required
by this section. No parking spaces or accessory structures are permitted within
the required buffer yard.
Village of Gurnee 12 7 Zoning Ordinance
Article 12. Landscape & Screening
b. As of the effective date of this Ordinance, buffer yards are required for new
construction1 along interior side and rear setbacks in the following cases:
(1) Where an R-5 or R-6 District abuts a R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4 District, or where a
multi-family dwelling is located in an R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4 District. This does
not apply to single-family and two-family dwellings located within an R-5 or R-
6 District.
(2) Where a non-residential use is located within a residential district.
(3) Where a non-residential district abuts a residential district.
(4) Where O-2, I-1, I-2, or I-3 District abuts a commercial district.
c. When the calculation of minimum buffer yard requirements results in a fraction,
said fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole number. The minimum size and
improvement of buffer yards is as follows:
(1) A buffer yard width must be a minimum of 10 feet in width.
(2) Two plant unit options are provided in Table 12-3: Plant Unit Options. Any
plant unit option or combination plant unit options may be used. Plantings
may be spaced or clustered as needed to respond to specific site conditions.
All shrubs required by this section must be large shrubs.
(3) One plant unit option is required per each 100 linear feet. When the yard is
less than 100 linear feet or when additional linear feet above the first 100 feet
are less than 100 feet, percentages based on that linear footage are allowed
to reduce the amount of plant material required. (For example, if the linear
footage is 25 feet, only 25% of the plantings required by a plant unit option
are required.) When the calculation of plant unit option requirements results
in a fraction, said fraction is rounded up.
(4) Large shrubs may be substituted for shade and ornamental trees in the
amounts described in this section. However, no more than 25% of required
shade and ornamental trees may be substituted by large shrubs.
(i) One Shade Tree: 15 Large Shrubs
(ii) One Ornamental Tree: 5 Large Shrubs
(5) Use of rocks or mulch in lieu of live groundcover plantings may not exceed
20% of the total landscape yard. Bare earth is prohibited.
1 For example, when new commercial construction locates next to an existing residential use, the new
commercial construction must provide the buffer yard. Conversely, if a new residential use locates next to
an existing commercial use, the existing commercial use is not required to provide a buffer yard and is not
considered nonconforming.

Zoning Board, then all fee requirements are waived.
4. Withdrawal or Lapse of Application
a. An applicant has the right to withdraw an application at any time prior to the final

1. Purpose
a. Text and Zoning Map Amendment
The regulations imposed and the districts created by this Ordinance may be
amended from time to time in accordance with this section. This process for
amending the Zoning Ordinance text or the Zoning Map is intended to allow
modifications in response to omissions or errors, changed conditions, or changes
in Village policy. Amendments are not intended to relieve particular hardships or
confer special privileges or rights upon any person or party.
b. Special Use Permit
This Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into districts. Within each
district the use of land and structures are substantially uniform. It is recognized,
however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be properly classified in a particular district or districts without individual
consideration of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location.
c. Variation
The purpose of the variation process is to provide a narrowly circumscribed
means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this
Ordinance that create practical difficulties or particular hardships.
2. Initiation
The Village Board, the Planning and Zoning Board, Village Administrator, or a
property owner in the Village, or person expressly authorized in writing by the
property owner, may initiate an application.
3. Authority
The Village Board, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Board, will take formal action on requests for zoning text and map amendments,
special use permits, and variations. However, the Zoning Administrator is authorized
to grant certain administrative exceptions, as described in Section 16.1 (Administrative
Exceptions).
Village of Gurnee 162 Zoning Ordinance
Article 16. Zoning Application Approval Processes
4. Procedure
All applications must be filed with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with
Section 15.0 (Application). Once it is determined that the application is complete, the
Zoning Administrator will schedule the application for consideration by the Planning
and Zoning Board. Amendments initiated by the Village Board or the Planning and
Zoning Board also require an application, but are exempt from fees.
a. Action by the Planning and Zoning Board
(1) After receipt of a complete application, the Planning and Zoning Board will
consider the proposed application at a public hearing in accordance with
Section 15.2 (Public Hearing). Notice for the public hearing must be in
accordance with Section 15.1 (Notice). If, in the Planning and Zoning Boards
judgment, the application does not contain sufficient information to enable the
Planning and Zoning Board to properly review and consider the application,
the Planning and Zoning Board may request additional information from the
applicant. In such event, the public hearing may be continued.
(2) Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning
Board must forward its recommendation to the Village Board, unless an
extension is agreed to by the applicant.
(3) The Planning and Zoning Board must evaluate the application based upon the
evidence presented at the public hearing, pursuant to the approval standards
of this section. For zoning text amendments, special use permits, and
variations, the Planning and Zoning Board must recommend approval,
approval with conditions, or denial of the application. For zoning map
amendments, the Planning and Zoning Board must recommend approval or
denial of the application. The Planning and Zoning Board may recommend a
variation that is less than that requested when it has been decided that the
applicant is entitled to some relief of the hardship, but not to the entire relief
requested.
b. Action by the Village Board
(1) The Village Board must act on the application within 60 days of receipt of the
Planning and Zoning Board recommendation. The Village Board must take
action in the form of approval, approval with conditions, or denial on
applications for zoning text amendments, special use permits, and variations,
and approval or denial on applications for zoning map amendments. In
approving any special use, the Village Board may require such evidence and
guarantees, as it may deem necessary, to assure compliance with any
stipulated conditions. In approving variations, the Village Board may grant a
variation that is less than that requested when it has been decided that the
applicant is entitled to some relief of the hardship, but not to the entire relief
requested.
Village of Gurnee 163 Zoning Ordinance
Article 16. Zoning Application Approval Processes
(2) If the Village Board does not act upon the application within 60 days of
receipt of the Planning and Zoning Board recommendation, the application is
deemed denied unless the Village Board has granted additional consideration
time.

5. Approval Standards
The Planning and Zoning Board recommendation and the Village Board decision on
any zoning text, map amendment, or special use permit is a matter of legislative
discretion that is not controlled by any particular standard. However, in making their
recommendation and decision, the Planning and Zoning Board and the Village Board
must consider the following standards. The approval of an application is based on a
balancing of these standards.

safety, and welfare of the Village.
(4) The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon
the applicant.
(5) The suitability of the subject property for the purposes for which it is presently
zoned.
(6) The length of time that the subject property in question has been vacant, as
presently zoned, considered in the context of development in the area where
the property is located.
(7) The consistency of the proposed amendment with the Comprehensive Plan
and any adopted land use policies.
(8) That the proposed amendment will benefit the needs of the community.
b. Approval Standards for Text Amendments

regulations of this Ordinance.
Village of Gurnee 165 Zoning Ordinance
Article 16. Zoning Application Approval Processes

will not endanger the public health, safety, or welfare.
(2) The proposed special use is compatible with the general land use of adjacent
properties and other property within the immediate vicinity.
(3) The special use in the specific location proposed is consistent with the spirit
and intent of this Ordinance and adopted Village land use policies.
(4) The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of this ordinance, except as such regulations may, in each
instance, be modified pursuant to the recommendations of the Planning and
Zoning Board.
d. Approval Standards for Variations
(1) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance will result in undue
hardship unless the specific relief requested is granted.
(2) The alleged hardship of the owner is due to unique circumstances inherent to
the subject property and has not been created by the owner.
(3) The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare, of the locality.
(4) The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property impose a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be
carried out.
6. Written Protest
a. Authority
If a written protest is properly filed against any map amendment, special use, or
planned unit development with the Village Clerk, the requested action will only be
approved by a favorable vote of at least 2/3 of the Village Trustees then holding
office. A written protest must be filed with the Village Clerk no later than 24 hours
prior to the Village Board meeting at which the subject application is to be acted

subject application for a proposed map amendment, special use or planned
unit development.
c. Protest Owner Defined
The owner of property is considered to be any of the following: the record owner
of the fee title; the contract seller, or current contract buyer of such property; or
those with beneficial interest in a land trust. If any property has multiple owners,
such property is counted for purposes of a written protest if at least 50% of all
owners of the subject property have signed the written protest.

conditions, all plans and drawings submitted as part of the application for a
building permit must include those conditions.
d. The applicant may file a written appeal of the decision of the Technical Review
Committee to the Planning and Zoning Board within 30 days after the date of the
final decision. The Planning and Zoning Board has final authority of the appeal.

Ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address
every specific zoning issue. However, this zoning interpretation authority is not
intended to add or change the essential content of the Ordinance.
2. Initiation
The Village Board, the Planning and Zoning Board, or a property owner in the
Village, or person expressly authorized in writing by the property owner, may initiate
a zoning interpretation application. All interpretation requests must be for the
purpose of furthering some actual development
3. Authority

17.3 NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD
17.4 NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS
17.5 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
17.0 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
1. Authority to Continue
Any structure, lot, or use that legally existed as a nonconformity as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, and any structure, lot, or use that has been made
nonconforming as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and any subsequent
amendments, may continue subject to the provisions of this Article so long as it
remains otherwise legal. A structure, lot, or use that is illegal as of the effective date
of this Ordinance, remains illegal if it does not conform with every requirement of this
Ordinance.
2. Burden on Property Owner
The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the provisions of this
Ordinance is the responsibility of the property owner of the nonconforming structure
or lot, or the operator of the use.
3. Safety Regulations
All police power regulations enacted to promote public health, safety, and welfare
including, but not limited to, all building, fire and health codes apply to
nonconformities.
17.1 NONCONFORMING USE
1. Definition
A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or land that at one time was an
allowed use within a zoning district, but because of subsequent amendments to the
Ordinance is no longer allowed.
2. Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on a structure that is
devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use, provided it does not create any
new nonconformity or increase the intensity of the nonconformity.
Village of Gurnee 172 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
3. Structural Alterations
No structural alterations are permitted on any structure devoted to a nonconforming
use, except in the following situations:
a. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the structure to
a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public
safety.
b. When the alteration is for the purpose of bringing about a conforming use.
c. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the
intensity of any existing nonconformity.
4. Expansion
A nonconforming use of a structure of land cannot be expanded, extended, enlarged,
or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity includes additions or enlargements
of any structure devoted entirely to a nonconforming use, and any expansion,
extension, or relocation of a nonconforming use to any other structure, any portion of
the floor area, or any land area currently not occupied by such nonconforming use.
5. Relocation
A nonconforming use of a structure or land cannot be relocated, in whole or in part,
to any other location on the same lot or parcel. The nonconforming use may only be
relocated to another structure or lot if the use conforms to all regulations of the
zoning district where it is relocated.
6. Change of Use
A nonconforming use cannot be changed to any use other than one allowed within
the zoning district where it is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed,
in whole or in part, to an allowed use, the whole or part that conforms cannot be
changed back to a use that is not allowed in the district. A change of use occurs
when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and another use has
commenced. Any change in use in violation of this Ordinance is deemed an
abandonment of the previously existing nonconforming use.
7. Discontinuation or Abandonment
If a nonconforming use is discontinued, or the structure that it occupies becomes
vacant and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of 180 days, the
nonconforming use is deemed abandoned and cannot be reestablished or resumed
regardless of intent. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure
must comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which the structure or land is
located. A period of discontinuance caused by acts of God or other events without
any contributing fault by the user are not included in calculating the length of
discontinuance for this section.
Village of Gurnee 173 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
8. Damage or Destruction
In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use is structurally damaged or destroyed through no fault of the property owner or
tenant, the nonconforming use may be re-established provided that no new
nonconformities are created and the degree of the previous nonconformity is not
increased. If the structure containing the nonconforming use is a nonconforming
structure, the structure may only be rebuilt, restored, repaired, or reconstructed in
accordance with Section 17.2 (Nonconforming Structure). However, if a building
permit is not obtained within one year of the date of damage or destruction, then the
nonconforming use may not be reestablished unless it conforms to all regulations of
the zoning district in it is located, including use.
17.2 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE
1. Definition
A nonconforming structure is a principal or accessory structure that at one time
conformed to applicable zoning regulations, but because of subsequent
amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to applicable dimensional or bulk
regulations. However, fences and walls are regulated by Section 17.4
(Nonconforming Site Elements) and nonconforming signs are regulated by Section
17.5.
2. Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on any nonconforming
structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new
nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity.
3. Structural Alterations
No structural alterations are permitted on any nonconforming structure, except in the
following situations:
a. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the structure to
a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public
safety,
b. When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity, or
c. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree
of any existing nonconformity. For example, if a structure is nonconforming in
terms of the required front setback (i.e., does not meet the required minimum),
the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all other bulk and setback
requirements of the district.
Village of Gurnee 174 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
4. Relocation
A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other
location on the same lot unless such relocation would make the structure
conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to another lot if the
structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated.
5. Damage or Destruction
a. In the event that a nonconforming structure is structurally damaged or destroyed
by the fault of the property owner or tenant, the structure, as restored or repaired,
must comply with all requirements of this Ordinance.
b. In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, through
no fault of the property owner or tenant, to the extent of 50% or more of its
replacement value at the time, then the structure may not be restored or rebuilt
unless the structure, including foundation, conforms to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located.
c. When such a structure is damaged or destroyed, through no fault of the property
owner or tenant, to the extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at the
time, it may be repaired and reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities
are created and that the existing degree of the nonconformity is not increased. A
building permit must be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or
reconstruction within one year of the date of damage or destruction. In the event
that the building permit is not obtained within one year, then the structure cannot
be restored unless it conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is
located.
d. The replacement value of the structure is based on: 1) the sale of that structure
within the previous year or, if that is not applicable; 2) an appraisal within the last
two years or, if that is not available; 3) the amount for which the structure was
insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction; or, 4) an alternative
method determined acceptable by the Village.
6. Extension of Walls for Nonconforming Single-Family and Two-family Dwellings
Where a single-family or two-family dwelling is deemed nonconforming because of
encroachment into the required interior side or rear yard, the structure may be
enlarged or extended vertically along the same plane as defined by its existing
perimeter walls, so long as the resulting structure does not increase the degree of
the existing nonconformity or otherwise violate any other district regulation. In
addition, any enlargement or extension must be a minimum of two feet from any side
lot line.
Village of Gurnee 175 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
17.3 NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD
1. Definition
A nonconforming lot of record is a lot of record that at one time conformed to the lot
dimension requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, but because of
subsequent amendments to the Ordinance no longer conforms to the applicable lot
dimensions.
2. Use
Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a
nonconforming lot of record may be used for a permitted or special use within the
zoning district.
3. Development
Development of a nonconforming lot of record must meet all applicable dimensional
or bulk regulations of the district in which it is located with the exception of the lot
dimension requirement that renders it nonconforming.
4. Common Ownership Limitation
If two or more lots of record have contiguous frontage in common ownership as of
the effective date of this Ordinance and one or more of the lots does not meet the
requirements for lot dimensions as established by this Ordinance, the lots involved
are considered to be a single lot for the purposes of this Ordinance. No division of
the lot is permitted that creates a nonconforming lot and/or renders the remaining
lot(s) nonconforming. No building permit will be issued for the use of any lot, or
portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this Article.
Village of Gurnee 176 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
17.4 NONCONFORMING SITE ELEMENTS
1. Definition
A nonconforming site element is a site development element, such as landscape,
fences or walls, lighting, or parking, that at one time conformed to the requirements
of this Ordinance, but because of subsequent amendments, has been made
nonconforming.
2. Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a nonconforming site element may be
performed. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new
nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity.
3. Required Conformance
All nonconforming site elements, with the exception of exterior lighting and signs,
must be brought into conformance when the following occurs. Exterior lighting is
subject to Paragraph 4 below. Signs are subject to Section 17.5.
a. A new principal structure is constructed on a site
b. An existing principal structure is increased in floor area by 30% or more.
c. An existing parking lot of 20 or more spaces is fully reconstructed or an existing
parking is expanded by 50% (based on number of spaces). Resealing or restriping
of an existing parking lot, which does not entail paving, resurfacing, or
replacement of the asphalt, concrete, or other paving material, is not considered
reconstruction.
d. For fences and walls only, when 50% or more of the length of a fence or wall is
reconstructed along a lot line, the entire fence or wall must be brought into
conformance.
4. Nonconforming Lighting
a. Luminaries legally installed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, but which
do not conform to the requirements and standards of this section are
nonconforming site elements and subject to the standards below.
b. Nonconforming luminaires that meet the performance standards of Section 10.1,
but exceed the physical design standards, such as height or setback, are
permitted to continue, subject to the following:
(1) Illumination systems installed as part of a planned unit development, special
use, annexation agreement, variation, or other specific Village approval
which, as of the effective date of this Ordinance, have a Village approved
lighting plan and meet the performance criteria of their specific agreements,
Village of Gurnee 177 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
must be brought into conformity with Section 10.1 when the illumination
system is completely replaced.
(2) Nonconforming illumination systems that do not have a specific Village
approved lighting plan must be brought into conformance with Section 10.1
when 25% of the illumination system is to be replaced or modified, calculated
as installation of new lighting posts and/or non-post mounted lighting fixtures.
This 25% is calculated based on the total lighting installed by the type of
mounting. For example, if over 25% of the wall-mounted fixtures are to be
replaced, all wall-mounted fixtures must be brought into conformance while
freestanding fixtures may remain.
c. Nonconforming luminaires that exceed the footcandle standards of Section 10.1
and/or direct light or glare towards streets, parking lots, residences, or lot lines,
and result in a problematic or dangerous condition must be either shielded,
redirected, or otherwise modified to meet the requirements of Section 10.1 within
60 days of notification, or apply for either an extension of the time or a variation
with a specific time period for amortization.
5. Nonconforming Parking Lot Landscape Exemption
When an existing parking lot is required by Paragraph 3 above to provide landscape,
which would result in creating a parking area that no longer conforms to the parking
regulations of this Ordinance, such existing parking lot is not required to install all or
a portion of the required landscape. The applicant is required to show that landscape
cannot be accommodated on the site. If only certain requirements are able to be
accommodated on the site, those elements shall be required. The Zoning
Administrator will make the determination that all or a portion of required landscape
does not have to be installed.
17.5 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
1. Any sign lawfully existing or under construction on the effective date of this
Ordinance that does not conform to one or more of the provisions of this Ordinance
may be continued in operation and maintained indefinitely as a nonconforming sign
subject to compliance with this Ordinance.
2. As an incentive to encourage the removal of nonconforming signs, staff is expressly
authorized to waive sign permit fees and special use permit application fees for
replacement signs. In deciding such requests, staff must consider whether the public
benefit derived from removal and replacement will be generally proportionate to the
fee waiver and/or deviation requested. The Planning and Zoning Board is also
authorized to approve minor exception requests for replacement signs if they
determine that the public benefit derived from removal and replacement will be
generally proportionate to the exception requested.
3. Routine maintenance of nonconforming signs is allowed, including changing of copy,
necessary non-structural repairs, and incidental alterations that do not expand,
extend or enlarge the nonconforming features of the sign. However, no structural
alteration, enlargement, or expansion may be made to a nonconforming sign unless
Village of Gurnee 178 Zoning Ordinance
Article 17. Nonconformities
the alteration, enlargement, or expansion will result in the elimination of the
nonconforming features of the sign.
4. A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified
to comply with these regulations if the structure to which it is accessory is
demolished or destroyed to an extent exceeding 150% of the structures assessed
value. A nonconforming sign and sign structure subject to removal under this
paragraph must be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner or lessee of the
property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the Zoning Administrator
must give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and
the sign must be removed within 30 days of such notice.
5. A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified
to comply with these regulations if the sign and sign structure is demolished or
destroyed to an extent exceeding 50% of its replacement cost. A nonconforming sign
and sign structure subject to removal under this paragraph must be removed by the
owner of the sign or the owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails
to remove the sign, the Zoning Administrator must give the owner/lessee written
notice of the requirements of this paragraph and the sign must be removed within 30
days of such notice.
6. A nonconforming sign and its associated sign structure must be removed or modified
to comply with the sign regulations of this article if the business or use on the
property ceases to operate for a continuous period of three months or more. If the
owner or lessee fails to remove or modify the sign, the Zoning Administrator must
give the owner/lessee written notice of the requirements of this paragraph and the
sign and sign structure must be removed within 30 days of such notice. If such sign
is not removed or modified after the 30 day period, the Village Board may take action
to authorize the removal of the sign and sign structure at the expense of the owner,
agent, or person having beneficial interest in the building or premises on which the
sign is located. In addition, the Village is authorized to institute and pursue all other
available remedies and penalties under the law.

secure the assistance of the Village Attorney to seek an injunction, abatement, or other
appropriate actions to enjoin, abate, or stop any violation of this Ordinance. At times, the
aid of the Police Department may be sought to enforce this Ordinance. The property

upon conviction, will be fined for each offence. Each day that a violation continues
constitutes a separate offense for the purposes of the penalties and remedies available
to the Village. The accumulation of penalties for violations, but not the obligation for
payment for violations already committed, ceases upon correction of the violation.
