PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of La Porte, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as supplemented through May 11, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1970 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and William Eddy and Robert MacNaughton, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John Armstrong, Askins and Armstrong, P.C., City Attorneys, and Sue Lenes, former City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

7.01. - Enfranchisement. 
a.  Power of council. City council shall have power by ordinance to grant, amend, renew and extend all franchises of all public utilities of every character operating within the city. All ordinances granting, amending, renewing or extending franchises for public utilities shall not be finally passed until thirty (30) days after the first reading; and no such ordinance shall take effect until sixty (60) days after its final passage; and pending such time, the notice and caption of such ordinance, noting the place where the full text may be examined by the public, shall be published once each week for four (4) consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the city, and the expense of such publication [is] to be borne by the proponent of the franchise. No public utility franchise shall be transferable except with the approval of council expressed by ordinance. 
b.  Extensions. All extensions of public utilities within the city limits shall become a part of the aggregate property of the public utilities, shall be operated as such, and shall be subject to all the obligations and reserved rights contained in this Charter and in any original grant hereafter made. The right to use and maintain any extension shall terminate with the original grant and shall be terminable as provided in section 7.02a. In case of an extension of a public utility operated under a franchise hereafter granted, such right shall be terminable at the same time and under the same conditions as the original grant. 
c.  Other conditions. All franchises heretofore granted are recognized as contracts between the city and the grantee, and the contractual right as contained in any such franchises shall not be impaired by the provisions of this Charter, except that the power of the city to exercise the right of eminent domain in the acquisition of any utility property is in all things reserved, and except the general power of the city heretofore existing and herein provided for to regulate the rates and services of the grantee which shall include the right to require proper and adequate extension of plant and service and the maintenance of the plant and fixtures at the highest reasonable standard of efficiency. 
    Every public utility franchise hereafter granted shall be held subject to all the terms and conditions contained in the various sections of this article whether or not such terms are specifically mentioned in the franchise. 
    When the city chooses to exercise its power of eminent domain to acquire any public utility, the procedure to be used in such acquisition shall be as set forth in V.T.C.A., Property Code §§ 21.011 to 21.065, inclusive. In valuing the property, the measure of damages shall be the fair market value of the physical properties taken together as one system. This power shall be in addition to and cumulative of any other powers of acquisition granted to or reserved by the city in a franchise ordinance. 
    Prior to the purchase of any existing franchised utility system, either according to the terms of the franchise or by eminent domain, city council shall submit the question of purchase to the voters of the city, and such must be approved by a majority of those voting. 
    Nothing in this Charter shall operate to limit in any way, as specifically stated, the discretion of council or the electors of the city in imposing terms and conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any franchise grant. 
(Ord. No. 2013-3482, § 4, 5-14-13) 
7.02. - Regulation. 
a.  Right of regulation. All grants, renewals, extensions or amendments of public utility franchises, whether it be so provided in the ordinance or not, shall be subject to the right of the city: 
1.  To repeal the same by ordinance at any time for failure to begin construction or operation within the time prescribed or otherwise to comply with the terms of the franchise, such power to be exercised only after due notice and hearing. 
2.  To require an adequate extension of plant and service, and the maintenance of the plant and fixtures at the highest reasonable standard of efficiency. 
3.  To establish reasonable standards of service and quality of products and prevent unjust discrimination in service of rates. 
4.  To prescribe the form of accounts kept by such utility. If the franchise does not prescribe the form of accounts kept by a utility, then it shall keep its accounts in accordance with the utility system of accounts for said utility prescribed by the appropriate state and federal utility regulatory agencies. 
5.  To examine and audit the accounts and other records of any such utility at any time and to require annual and other reports, including reports on local operations by each such public utility. 
6.  To impose such reasonable regulations and restrictions as may be deemed desirable or conducive to the safety, welfare and accommodation of the public. 
7.  To at any time require such compensation and rental as may be permitted by the laws of the State of Texas. 
b.  Regulation of rates and service. Council shall have full power, after due notice and hearing, to regulate by ordinance the rates and service of every public utility operating within the city. Such power shall be subject to the exercise of power in each area of each utility by the appropriate agencies of state and federal government. 
7.03. - Franchise records. 
    Within six (6) months after this Charter takes effect, every public utility and every owner of a public utility franchise shall file with the city, as may be prescribed by ordinance, certified copies of all franchises owned or claimed, or under which such utility is operated in the city. 
    The city shall compile and maintain a public record of public utility franchises. 
7.04. - Accounts of municipality-owned utilities. 
    Accounts shall be kept for each public utility owned or operated by the city, in such manner as to show the true and complete financial results of such city ownership and operation, including all assets, appropriately subdivided into different classes, all liabilities subdivided by classes, depreciation, reserve, other reserves and surplus, also revenues, operating expenses, including depreciation, interest payments, rental and other disposition of annual income. The accounts shall show the actual capital cost to the city of each public utility owned, also the cost of all extensions, additions and improvements, and the source of the funds expended for such capital purposes. They shall show as nearly as possible the cost of any service furnished to or rendered by any such utility to any other city or governmental department. City council shall annually cause to be made by a licensed certified public accountant and shall publish a report showing the financial results of such city ownership and operation, giving the information specified in this section or such data as council shall deem expedient, in accordance with section 5.08. 
7.05. - Franchise value disallowed. 
    The value of the franchise granted by the city shall not be included in fixing reasonable rates and charges for utility service within the city or in determining the just compensation to be paid by the city for public utility property which may be acquired by eminent domain or otherwise. 
7.06. - Consent of property owners. 
    The consent of abutting and adjacent property owners shall not be required for the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of any public utility; but nothing in this Charter or in any franchise granted thereunder shall be construed to deprive any such property owner of any rights of action for damage or injury to his property as now or hereafter provided by law.

8.05. - Effect of this Charter on existing law. 
    All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations now in force under the city government of the city and not in conflict with the provisions of this Charter shall remain in force under this Charter until altered, amended or repealed by city council after this Charter takes effect; and all rights of the city under existing franchises and contracts are preserved in full force and effect to the city, and any unissued bonds and revenue bonds, or installments thereof, heretofore authorized at an election held in said city shall not be affected by the adoption of this Charter, but the right to sell, issue and deliver same, in whole or in part, in keeping with the provisions of the laws under which they were voted is hereby expressly reserved.

Amendments may be proposed and submitted to the electors of the city by ordinance passed by a majority vote of the full membership of city council or by a petition signed by qualified voters of the city in number not less than five (5) per cent thereof or twenty thousand (20,000) signatures, whichever is less. Such petition shall in all other respects conform to the provisions of Article VI. 
    When a properly drawn petition has been duly filed, council shall provide by ordinance for submitting such proposed amendments to a vote of the qualified voters at an election to be held in accordance with the Texas Election Code. If the next regular municipal election is to be held during said period, the submission of said amendment or amendments shall be at such election.

b.  Submission of Charter to electors. The charter committee in preparing this comprehensive Charter amendment finds and decides that it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function, it is necessary that the comprehensive amendment be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons the charter committee directs that said amended Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the city at an election to be held for that purpose on the 9th day of August, 1980.

The city commission shall at its next meeting declare this Charter adopted. The clerk shall furnish the mayor a copy of said Charter, which copy of the Charter so adopted, authenticated and certified by his signature and the seal of the city, shall be forwarded by the mayor to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and shall show the approval of such Charter by majority vote of the qualified voters voting at such election.

Sec. 2-1. - Policy for naming city facilities. 
(a)  Purpose. To establish guidelines and procedures for the naming of municipal facilities or donation of a memorial tree with plaque. 
(b)  Procedures. 
(1)  To initiate the naming process, an application should be requested from and returned to the city secretary's office. A set of procedures and guidelines will accompany each application for completion. 
(2)  A standing committee, appointed by council and composed of Councilmembers from the three at-large positions (mayor, position "A," and position "B"), will consider all applications and provide recommendations. 
(3)  The council committee will present their recommendation to the full city council to consider the naming of the city facility or parkland. 
(4)  Generally, municipal facilities will be named immediately prior to or during development of the facilities. 
(c)  Guidelines. 
(1)  In honor of individuals who donate land for park space or donate a major part of the funds required to construct or renovate a facility. A minimum of 50 percent or more of the total funds is necessary to constitute a major portion. 
(2)  Outstanding and/or predominant historical features of significance. Historical features will include the names of early residents or citizens and/or events of significance to the area's development. 
(3)  In honor of deceased local community leaders. Deceased local community leaders must have served in an elected or appointed position of the city. These leaders must have provided outstanding personal service that has resulted in a significant and enduring contribution to the community and have been deceased for a minimum of five years. 
(4)  In honor of deceased national or state leaders. Deceased national or state leaders must have directly impacted the citizens of the city and have been deceased for a minimum of five years. 
(5)  In relation to outstanding and/or predominant geographical characteristics or physical features of the land. such as streams, rivers, plant species, etc. Geographical and physical features will include those naturally occurring. (i.e., vegetation materials, streams, rivers, creeks, lakes or forested areas), and those man-made, (i.e., subdivisions, streets, office/industrial complexes or other commercial areas). 
(6)  In relation to a street or streets adjacent to the facility or parkland. 
(7)  In relation to a subdivision that houses the facility or is adjacent to the parkland. 
(8)  Municipal recreation centers that are a part of or lie within the boundaries of a park shall bear the name of that park unless the park name cannot be incorporated in the facility name. 
(9)  Municipal facilities may be given the same name as a school site, where the sites abut one another. 
(10)  Renaming of a public street. Renaming of a public street shall require the concurrence from a minimum of 75 percent of the property owners abutting the proposed street. Persons and/or groups submitting street names for consideration shall be required to provide a notarized list of concurring property owners and to defray the cost (at least 60 percent) of installing signs and other expenses (i.e. maps, plats, 911, etc.) Streets in newly platted subdivisions or streets that have not been developed are exempt from this policy. 
(11)  Renaming of a municipal facility. Renaming of municipal facilities may be considered if exceptional circumstances exist, but should not be a common practice. In such circumstances, care must be taken to avoid renaming because the purpose of the prior naming had become obscured over time (and thus eliminate appropriate recognition or honor). 
(12)  Donation of a tree for city park or facility. If more appropriate for the circumstances, a request may be presented to plant a tree in memory of the significant contributor. A small plaque (no larger than 12 inches by 12 inches) will be placed at the foot of the tree with name, date(s), and honored contribution to the community. The plaque must be installed to grade. This memorial shall follow the same recommended guidelines as for naming a facility.

Nominated individuals shall have been deceased for a minimum of five years.

Sec. 2-106. - Qualification requirement of bidders; filing of contractor's qualification statement. 
(a)  The city council has determined, and does hereby find, determine, and declare that it is in the best interest of the city that in the case of all construction projects having an owner's estimated construction cost of greater than $1,000,000.00, all bidders must submit with their bid package, a satisfactory contractor's qualification statement, on forms to be provided by the city. Submission of a contractor's qualification statement is a condition precedent to execution of a contract by the city with the successful bidder. 
(b)  For projects with an owner's estimated construction cost of less than $1,000,000.00, contractors may be required to file a contractor's qualification statement, if such is determined by the city manager to be required. In making such determination, the city manager shall review the city's past experience with projects of similar nature; the recommendation of the project architect/engineer which considers the complexity of the project; and the uniqueness or novelty of the anticipated project which may require a high degree of contractor specialization, technical expertise and/or previous experience on similar projects. 
(c)  After the bid opening the city shall request audited financial statements from the apparent low bidder. The information contained in such contractor's qualification statement and audited financial statement is deemed confidential; shall not be disclosed by the city to the public or to other contractors; and shall be deemed exempt from disclosure under the Open Records Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq., in accordance with the state attorney general's opinion number ORD-309,1982. The city council finds that disclosure of the financial information is likely to have either of the following effects: 
(1)  To impair the city's ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or 
(2)  To cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained. 
(Ord. No. 1476-B, § 1, 7-22-91; Ord. No. 2007-2968, § 1, 2-26-07; Ord. No. 2009-3192, § 1, 10-12-09)

(b)  Attendance of pre-bid conference required. All contractors (or representatives of the contractors) desiring to bid on city construction projects subject to section 2-106 of this Code must attend a prebid conference. Otherwise, such contractors' bids will be returned by the city unopened. 
(c)  Determination of bidding capacity. The city is interested in determining a contractor's bidding capacity for the purpose of awarding contracts subject to section 2-106 of this Code. Bidding capacity for each contractor shall be equal to net working capital. Net working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities, as shown on a balance sheet audited by an independent certified public accountant. The city will determine the minimum bidding capacity for each project. Only those contractors possessing a bidding capacity meeting or exceeding that minimum will be considered qualified for that project. 
(d)  Standards for contractor disqualification. The city council adopts the following standards for disqualification of contractors: 
(1)  Automatic disqualification. Automatic disqualification shall take place under the following circumstances: 
a.  The company has a negative net working capital or does not meet minimum bidding capacity. 
b.  There is a failure to complete statements in all detail. 
c.  The company or personnel are on the federal job debarment list. 
d.  The company or personnel are on the Justice Department list of unacceptable contractors; i.e. convicted on antitrust violations. 
e.  There is a failure to complete a statement in a truthful manner. 
(2)  Other considerations for possible disqualification. Disqualification may also take place according to the following considerations: 
a.  Companies with pending litigation may be disqualified for the duration of litigation as deemed to the advantage of the city by the city's project manager. 
b.  There is a default on the contract, or forfeiture of bid bonds or performance bonds. 
c.  There is a performance record of poor workmanship on previous projects. 
d.  There is a performance record of failure to complete warranty work.

Sec. 6-3. - Consumption or possession with intent to consume alcoholic beverages on city property. 
(1)  Prohibited. A person commits an offense if he consumes or possesses with intent to consume an alcoholic beverage in or on any real property owned by or leased by or to the city or the La Porte Independent School District. 
(2)  Permits for certain noncommercial events. The director of parks and recreation may issue special permits for noncommercial events (such as wedding receptions, private parties and similar gatherings, but not including athletic events), for a daily fee in an amount established by the city and listed in appendix A of this Code, permitting consumption of alcoholic beverages in or on any real property owned by or leased by or to the city. 
(3)  Rules, regulations, and security requirements for special events with alcohol permits, at recreation centers and outdoor facilities. 
(a)  Alcohol permits will not be issued at City of La Porte Recreation Centers, with the exception of Evelyn Kennedy Civic Center, unless authorized by the director of parks and recreation or the department operations manager. 
(b)  Alcohol permits will be issued at City of La Porte outdoor venues upon approval of a special use event permit or co-sponsorship event permit, also issued by the director of parks and recreation or the department operations manager. Exception will be made for the Lomax Rodeo Arena, provided a standard rental/lease agreement is completed satisfactorily by the Lessee. 
(c)  Alcohol is permitted to be consumed at City of La Porte owned or leased property by permit only. Alcoholic beverages of any kind cannot be sold by lessee or guests. A City of La Porte Alcohol Permit must be purchased at the parks and recreation office for $25.00 and posted at the event. If the permit is not posted, security officers will not allow any consumption of alcohol, and all alcohol will need to be removed from the premises. The person whose signature is on the permit must be on site the entire time alcohol is being consumed. All laws, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages, shall be strictly complied with. Alcohol consumption will be confined to the congregate/kitchen areas only, for buildings, and fenced or enclosed areas for outdoor events, as specified in the permit. No alcoholic beverages will be permitted to be carried out of that designated area, nor can it be consumed in the parking lot(s). 
(d)  The duties of security officer includes counting the number of guests at the front door to meet fire code and department regulations, monitoring the ballroom and parking lot; and enforcing all existing national, state, and local laws, ordinances, and parks and recreation department rules and regulations. 
(e)  It is the purview of the parks and recreation director, the operations manager, or their designee, to determine the specific number of security officers required for each event and to arrange for such security service, based on the guidelines above, the governing city ordinance(s), and the information provided by the lessee. Therefore, the pre-event security request forms sent to the police department will designate the predetermined number of security required for each event. Only the parks and recreation department director or operations manager for the department are authorized to make changes to the number of security required, as mentioned above, for unforeseen circumstances that may make an adjustment in security levels necessary. The lessee does not have authority to reduce pre-arranged security levels for any event. Security officers are authorized to restrict the number of attendees for an event to the number pre-specified by the lessee. 
(f)  Security officers are required whenever alcohol is permitted. The City of La Porte has a contractual agreement with the La Porte Police Officers' Association, and they have the exclusive right to provide security services for City of La Porte events. Lessee agrees to allow the City of La Porte to arrange for security officers, and agrees that lessee will pay $30.00 per hour per security officer. Security must be scheduled by the seventh business day prior to the event date and no changes can be made seven or less business days prior to event. If for any reason the event is cancelled seven or less days prior to the event, the customers deposit will be applied to the security officer's payment and invoiced for the difference if any. Security officers are to be paid in cash the actual date of the event prior to the events scheduled time. If the payment for security services is not paid in cash prior to the event, the contract for the event shall be considered null and void, and the security agent has the right to cancel the event. Please be aware you will forfeit your deposit and rental fee, and the event will not take place if you fail to meet this obligation. 
(g)  It is the responsibility of the security officers to keep fully informed of, and enforce all existing and future federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, as well as rules and regulations of the parks and recreation department. 
(h)  Lessee is responsible for all payments to security officers for services rendered, except in cases where scheduling conflicts arise and parks and recreation personnel are at fault. Final determination of fault lies solely with the director of parks and recreation or the department operations manager. 
(4)  Exceptions. The Bay Forest Golf Course is expressly exempted from subsection (a) of this section; provided, however, that the city-approved concessionaire shall comply with section 6-38 of this Code which requires an annual license from the city for the sale of beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages.

Sec. 30-43. - False activation prohibited; exceptions.

(Ord. No. 2009-3199, § 1, 11-9-09) 
Sec. 30-44. - Service fees for permit and city response to an alarm. 
    The city may charge service fees for its permits and responses to false alarms in accordance with this chapter. Except as may be hereinafter set forth, service fees for issuance of permits, false alarms and any other charges and penalties arising pursuant to this chapter shall be in such amounts as may be established in this chapter and as may, from time to time, be adopted by resolution of the city council of the City of La Porte. Delinquent service fees may be billed to the permit holder by including service fee on permit holder's water bill notification form. With respect to alarm systems, no penalty or service fee for signaling of a false alarm by an alarm system shall be made unless at least three other false alarms have occurred during the preceding 12 months. The service fee may be assessed against the owners, occupants or person in control of the premises where the alarm system is located. The amount assessed for a false alarm of an alarm system after three previous false alarms will be $50.00 for the fourth and fifth false alarm, $75.00 for the sixth and seventh false alarm, and $100.00 per response thereafter. The permit holder may take an on-line false alarm awareness training course in lieu of a service fee once every twelve months. The permit holder may file a request for hearing with the city director of finance to dispute the service fee within ten days of receipt of a notification of service fee. The city acknowledges that newly installed alarm systems may incur false alarms during installation and adjustment period, therefore false alarms made or caused as a result of installation or adjustment during a period of ten days from initial installation or permit date, will not be charged against the permit holder as false alarms for the purpose of service fees as set forth in this article. 
    For purposes of calculating the service fees set out in this chapter an alarm system shall mean and include all alarm systems operated under one permit. 
    A reinstated permit as provided for elsewhere in this chapter shall retain its original issuance date for the purposes of the commencement of the "twelve-month period" when assessing service fees under this chapter, and shall not have any excusable false alarm responses available in addition to those already used during that period for an alarm system. Following the reinstatement, responses made prior to the date of revocation but not part of the basis for the revocation shall be included in computations, however, responses from the date of revocation through the date of reinstatement shall be chargeable, such charges must be paid before reinstatement becomes effective. Reinstatement of the permit shall be the only means of restoration of the lawful use of the alarm system hereunder after the permit has been revoked, provided however, that a new permit must be applied for and issued before operation of the alarm system if the ownership or possessor rights to the alarm site have changed since the most recent application or amendment thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2009-3199, § 1, 11-9-09) 
Sec. 30-45. - Refusal to permit and revocation. 
(a)  The city may refuse to permit or revoke a permit for an alarm system for the following reasons: 
(1)  The applicant or permit holder has failed to make payment in full to the city of any service fees assessed pursuant to this chapter within 60 days of the date the city has made notification of service fees owed by way of the permit holders water bill notice or other means. 
(2)  The alarm system of the applicant or permit holder has or is of the type that has had a history of unreliability. For purposes of this chapter, an alarm system shall be presumed to be unreliable if the applicant or permit holder accrues more than eight false alarms during a twelve month period, excluding any false alarms which may have formed the basis for a prior revocation during that same 12-month period. In the event a permit is issued or reinstated despite such presumption of unreliability, revocation shall occur if the permit holder accrues more than three false alarms from the date of reinstatement. 
(3)  The city chief of police and or the city fire chief may establish additional standards to determine reliability or unreliability of alarm systems as may be needed. 
(b)  Procedure. Refusal to permit or revocation. 
(1)  There shall be no refusal, termination, revocation or failure to renew a permit for an alarm system except as set forth herein. The city shall give at least thirty days notice prior to revoking, failing to renew or otherwise terminating a permit during which time a request for a hearing may be made. With respect to an application for a permit which the city refuses to permit, the applicant shall be given at least 30 days within which to request a hearing regarding such determination by the city to refuse to permit. The notice of refusal to permit or notice of revocation shall specify the reason therefore. If a hearing is requested, the permit holder or applicant shall be advised as to the date, time and place of such hearing. The hearing shall be before the city director of finance or designee. The permit holder or applicant may appear in person or be represented by counsel, may present testimony and may cross-examine all witnesses. 
(c)  All hearings shall be conducted under rules consistent with the nature of the proceedings, provided that the following rules shall apply to such hearings: 
(1)  All parties shall have the right to representation by a licensed attorney although an attorney is not required; 
(2)  Each party may present witnesses in their own behalf; 
(3)  Each party has the right to cross-examine all witnesses; 
(4)  All the evidence presented before the hearing officer at such hearing may be considered in a final report; and 
(5)  The city director of finance or designee may adjust the amount of any service fees owed upon a showing of good cause by the applicant or permit holder. 
(d)  If the permit holder or applicant fails to appear at the hearing at the date, time and place specified, the city shall present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case showing that grounds existed for the revocation or refusal to permit as provided for in this chapter. 
(e)  If the city director of finance or designee finds that no grounds exist for reinstatement of the permit or issuance of the permit for the alarm system, he shall refuse to reinstate or to issue such permit and shall give written notice to the permit holder or applicant of such finding. Upon receipt of such notice the permit holder or applicant shall disconnect such alarm system immediately and shall surrender his permit, if any, to the city. 
(f)  If the city director of finance or designee finds that there are insufficient grounds for revoking or for denying issuance of a permit for an alarm system exist, he shall give written notice of such finding to the permit holder or applicant. 
(g)  Reinstatement. 
(1)  A permit can be reinstated if the revoked permit holder has failed to request a hearing within the specified time for filing an application for reinstatement, pays the application fee which is the same as that for a new permit application, and shows: 
a.  That the cause of the chargeable false alarms has been corrected; and 
b.  The service fees assessed have been paid. 
(2)  If a permit holder has had a permit revoked twice during the term of that permit, that person must wait a period of one year from the date of the second revocation or, if one has been requested, the date of the denial issued pursuant to a reinstatement hearing before applying for a new permit of that alarm site. 
(3)  If a reinstated permit is denied pursuant to this section, a hearing may be requested if received in writing within ten working days of the date of notice of denial.

DIVISION 2. - BILLING POLICY AND PROCEDURES 

Sec. 30-86. - Policy for EMS billing. 
(a)  The City of La Porte recognizes the need to bill for these services to aid in the provision of emergency medical services. 
(b)  No person requiring EMS shall be denied services due to a lack of insurance or ability to pay. 
(c)  Any applicable charges for EMS rendered shall be billed directly to the patient or to the patient's third party payer. 
(d)  A patient who receives emergency medical services from the City of La Porte is obligated, at the time of service or as soon as practicable thereafter, to provide to the City of La Porte with all pertinent insurance and payment information to facilitate the City of La Porte in the billing of third party payment sources for services rendered. The City of La Porte may, at its option, and shall, where required by law, bill insurers or carriers on a patient's behalf and may accept payment on an assignment basis. 
(e)  All patients, whether or not domiciled in the City of La Porte, and/or their financially responsible parties, insurers or carriers, will be billed for emergency medical services provided by the City of La Porte according to the fee schedule established herein or at rates established by the City of La Porte - City Council from time to time. 
(f)  All patients, whether or not domiciled in the City of La Porte, shall be liable for any co-payment or deductible amounts not satisfied by public or private insurance, and the City of La Porte shall make reasonable collection efforts for all such balances according to the most current rules or regulations set forth by applicable health care financing administration federal policies and regulations. 
(g)  The City of La Porte may bill any applicable coinsurance carriers for such amounts. 
(h)  Exceptions include only those instances where the City of La Porte has knowledge of a particular patient's indigence or where the City of La Porte has made a determination that the cost of billing and collecting such co-payments or deductibles exceeds or is disproportionate to the amounts to be collected. 
(i)  The City of La Porte shall not balance bill when prohibited by law. 
(j)  A patient for whom the City of La Porte does not bill on assignment and who receives payment directly from a third party payer for emergency medical services rendered by the City of La Porte is obligated to remit such monies to the City of La Porte in the event the City of La Porte has not been paid for services rendered. Patients who do not remit such monies may be held liable for costs of collection in addition to the charges for emergency medical services rendered. 
(k)  The City of La Porte may, either directly or through any third party billing agency with which it has contracted for billing and/or collections for emergency medical services, make arrangements with patients and/or their financially responsible party for installment payments of bills so long as the City of La Porte determines that: 
(1)  The financial condition of the patient requires such an arrangement; and 
(2)  The patient and/or financially responsible party has demonstrated a willingness to make good faith efforts towards payment of the bill. 
(Ord. No. 2273-B, § 2, 12-3-07) 
Sec. 30-87. - Procedure for EMS billing. 
(a)  The City of La Porte - EMS is hereby authorized to perform all EMS billing and/or collection services. 
(b)  Funds payable to the City of La Porte by third party payers and/or carriers will NOT be routinely negotiated and will be deposited directly into a designated City of La Porte account, through a lock box or similar arrangement. 
(c)  Exceptions to funds payable to the City of La Porte for EMS services will be limited to negotiations agreed upon between a legal representative of a patient or the party responsible for the patient's personal financial obligations and the chief EMS officer. 
(d)  A detailed listing of patients who utilize emergency medical services will be compiled by the City of La Porte EMS Department. This information will be collected for billing and documentation purposes only. The information will be subject to the confidentiality requirements of applicable law. This information will include, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Name, address, and telephone number of patient. 
(2)  Name, address and claim number of insurance carrier, if applicable. 
(3)  Date, time and EMS chart number. 
(4)  Point of origin and destination. 
(5)  Odometer reading at point of pick up and destination. 
(6)  Reason for transport/ patient's complaint/ current condition. 
(7)  Itemization and description of services provided and charges. 
(8)  Signature of the patient, when possible, or authorized decision maker. 
(9)  Name of receiving physician. 
(10)  Names, titles, and signatures of EMS personnel, when possible. 
(e)  All fees for services rendered are payable to the City of La Porte Emergency Medical Service. The fee schedule for emergency medical services shall be as established and printed in Appendix A-Fees, Chapter 30, Emergency Services, Article III, Emergency Medical Services. 
(f)  The fees established above may be increased periodically, with EMS chief officer recommendation and subsequent approval by city council. 
(g)  The city may, in its discretion, bill additionally for material, vehicle and personnel costs in the case of major or unique incidents. 
(h)  EMS may promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to and not inconsistent with this article, state and federal law, such rules and regulations to be approved by city council. 
(i)  Due to the complex nature of the health care industry and associated billing for related services, the City of La Porte EMS may utilize a claims processing procedure based upon the patient's payer type. Each payer type requires a unique claims process and time frame. When a patient contracts with a combination of payer types, the claims process must be extended to accommodate a claim submission to each payer and a prescribed amount of time for repayment. 
(j)  The following policy establishes guidelines that will address the billing process, collection and bad debt for the City of La Porte EMS: 
(1)  Major payer types: 
Patient (uninsured). 
Medicare. 
Medicaid. 
Private health insurance (commercial). 
Workman's compensation (work related injuries). 
Third party liability (auto). 
(k)  It is important to note that the patient may present several combinations of payer types. Although specific rules apply to identify the primary payer when multiple insurance carriers are presented, failure to identify the correct primary payer will extend the billing process; additionally, the number of insurance carriers presented will have a direct bearing on the billing time frame. 
(l)  EMS billing will be completed as soon as possible or within ten days of the date of service. Subsequent billings and collection guidelines are based on the various payer types as follows: 
(1)  Patient payer (no insurance): 
1st invoice 30 days 2nd invoice 60 days 3rd invoice 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
(2)  Medicare/Medicaid only payer: 
1st invoice 30 days Denial received (prompts review) 60 days 2nd denial (prompt patient billing) 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
(3)  Medicare with supplemental health insurance payer: 
1st invoice 30 days Denial received (prompts review) 60 days 2nd denial (prompt patient billing) 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
(4)  Worker's compensation: 
1st invoice 30 days Denial received (prompt third party billing) 60 days 2nd denial received 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
Worker's compensation has 60 days to approve or deny a claim. A worker's compensation denial will transfer the billing process to a third party payment type (employer). The patient cannot be billed until both the employer and worker's compensation have both denied the claim as a non-industrial related injury (following an appeal process). 
(5)  Third party liability: 
1st invoice to insurance and/or patient 30 days 2nd invoice 60 days 3rd invoice 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
Patients must resolve litigation matters (i.e., auto accidents) outside of this billing process due to the length of time involved in typical civil claims dispute process. The patient will be held responsible for payment. 
(6)  Private insurance-No supplemental: 
1st invoice to insurance or patient 30 days 2nd invoice 60 days 3rd invoice 90 days Patient final invoice (10 days to pay) 120 days Attorney final demand letter 130 days  
(m)  Periodic payment agreements shall be based upon an agreement 30 days from the date of provision of services. A failure of a debtor to make three periodic payments within a 12-month period under a repayment agreement, either consecutive or intermittent, is to be considered a breech of agreement resulting in the patient receiving an attorney final demand letter requesting the immediate payment of the remaining amount owed in full. 
(n)  The chief EMS officer reserves the right to review all outstanding accounts and to fully discharge or otherwise write-off delinquent accounts which in his or her determination are not suitable for further collection efforts.

(a)  The city council has determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence, juvenile gang activity and an increase in crime by persons under the age of 18 in the city.

(b)  The city has an obligation to provide for: 
(1)  The protection of minors from each other and from other persons; 
(2)  The establishment of parental control of and responsibility for their children; 
(3)  The protection of the general public; and 
(4)  The reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities.

ARTICLE V. - REGULATION OF SEX OFFENDER RESIDENCY 

Sec. 42-102. - Finding and intent. 
    The city council finds that repeat sex offenders, sex offenders that use physical violence and who are convicted of preying on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the health, safety, and welfare of children. Sex offenders are likely to use physical violence, to repeat an offense, have many more victims than are ever reported, are prosecuted for only a fraction of their actual sexual offenses, and children not only lack the ability to protect themselves but additional measures should be taken to keep known sex offenders from having access to children in areas where children generally feel safe. 
    It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain registered sex offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residency.

(b)  For the purpose of determining the minimum distance of separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent or temporary residence to the nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather, as described herein, or in the case of multiple residences on one property, measuring from the outer property line of the multi-residence premises following a straight line to the nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather, as described herein.

Sec. 62-102. - Excavation, boring and tunneling. 
(a)  When an excavation is planned to be made in a street or right-of-way under a paved surface, such excavation shall be accomplished by trenchless methods except for those locations where the director has determined that trenchless methods would not be technically or economically practical for the utility or where otherwise exempted by the director. This provision does not apply to emergency repairs, in-kind replacement and other proposed work that meets the qualifications for a permit exemption provided in section 62-104(a)(2) of this chapter. 
(b)  All excavation, backfill and restoration of a right-of-way area in connection with utility's facilities shall be the same as the City of La Porte Water Line Backfill detail or as otherwise specified in an approved permit.

(ii)  Excavations made outside of the street, shoulder or curb for the installation of a utility service drop; 
(iii)  The replacement in-kind of a single damaged utility pole or light pole. 
(6)  In no case shall an exemption of the permit requirement relieve the obligation of the person excavating to provide sufficient notice for other existing utility locations and markings prior to construction. 
(7)  In no case shall an exemption of the permit requirement constitute a waiver any other provision of this ordinance. 
(c)  When permits are required, the permit will be in the name of the person who will own the facilities to be constructed. The permit application must be completed and signed by a representative of the owner of the facilities to be constructed. During the term of the permit the utility shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any entity used by the utility when such entity is involved directly or indirectly in the construction and installation of the utility's facilities to the same extent as if the acts or omissions of such entity were the acts or omissions of the utility and consistent with the Texas Local Government Code. 
(d)  Any person desiring a permit shall apply for such at least ten working days before the commencement of any work unless otherwise waived by the director. Notwithstanding this limitation, the utility is encouraged to request a waiver from the director if the 10-working-day period may be burdensome to the end user requesting utility service or that the end user might otherwise be without service. The director will make every reasonable effort not to delay the utility of the utility's ability to provide service to the end user. A permit is not effective and valid until it is signed by the director or his designated representative. 
(e)  The work for which a permit is issued shall be commenced within 45 days of the effective date of the permit.

Sec. 66-140. - Redevelopment tax abatement authorized. 
(1)  Creation of reinvestment zones. 
(a)  A property tax abatement program is hereby created to be administered in accordance with V.T.C.A., Tax Code Ch. 312, as amended from time to time. Tax abatement shall only be allowed in a reinvestment zone. 
(b)  Reinvestment zones in the city for this purpose will be considered for designation by city council upon the recommendation of the city manager's office. The city council may approve the creation of these reinvestment zones on a zone-by-zone basis after a public hearing before the city council. Following the public hearing the city council may consider the ordinance creating a new reinvestment zone in the proposed area. 
(c)  The city council may not adopt an ordinance designating a reinvestment zone until it has held a public hearing at which interested persons are entitled to speak and present evidence for or against the designation. Notice of the hearing shall be given at least seven days prior to the hearing. The presiding officers of eligible jurisdictions shall be notified in writing at least seven days prior to the hearing. 
A notice of the public hearing shall be given to other affected taxing jurisdictions, published in the legal classified section of the local daily newspaper having general circulation, and posted in other places as deemed appropriate, including notice to civic associations in the area surrounding the proposed zone, at least seven days prior to the hearing. The notice shall contain the location, time, and place of the public hearing and a description of the proposed boundaries of the reinvestment zone. 
(d)  The designation of such a zone by ordinance shall constitute an affirmative finding by the city council that the improvements sought to be constructed or repairs to be made within the zone are feasible and practical and would be of benefit to the land to be included within a zone and to the city. 
(e)  In determining whether an area qualifies as a reinvestment zone for the property tax abatement program, the city council shall use any one or more of the following criteria as guidelines: 
(1)  The area substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the city; retards the provision of housing accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability and is a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition and use by reasons of the presence of substantial number of substandard, slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures, predominance of defective or inadequate sidewalks or street layout; faulty lot layout in relation to size, accessibility, or usefulness, unsanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other improvements; tax or special assessment delinquency exceeds the fair value of the land; defective or unusual conditions of title; the existence of conditions that endanger life or property by fire or other cause; or any combination of these factors or conditions. 
(2)  The area is predominantly open and, because of obsolete platting or deterioration of structures or site improvements or other factors, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the city. 
(3)  The area has been designated a local or state-federal enterprise zone under the Texas Enterprise Zone Act. 
(4)  The area is located wholly within an eligible blighted area, as identified from time to time by city council. 
(5)  There has been a demonstration of community interest and there is evidence that substantial number of owners of taxable real property in the reinvestment zone will participate in such a program. 
(6)  Be reasonably likely as a result of the designation to contribute to the retention or expansion of primary employment or to attract major investment in the zone that would be a benefit to the property and that would contribute to the economic development of the city. 
(f)  The goals and objectives expressed above and the standards and restrictions expressed in V.T.C.A., Tax Code Ch. 312, as amended, are not exhaustive and shall be supplemented by such further and additional goals, objectives, rules, standards and restrictions as the city council may from time to time impose. 
(g)  The designation of a reinvestment zone hereunder shall expire five years after the date of its designation and may be renewed for periods not to exceed five years. The expiration of a designation, however, shall not affect existing agreements entered into pursuant to section 66-140 or section 66-145 of this chapter. 
(2)  Agreement for redevelopment property tax abatement. 
(a)  Upon designation of a reinvestment zone, the city may enter into property tax abatement agreements with interested owners of taxable real property located within the reinvestment zone. The agreement shall be conditioned on the owner of the property making certain improvement or repairs to the property as outlined in section 66-143, "application", of this article. 
(b)  In addition to the guidelines and criteria contained herein, to be eligible for tax abatement the planned improvement: 
(1)  Should provide an economic benefit to the city, taking all relevant factors into consideration, including (i) size of the abatement, (ii) income from sales tax and franchise fees generated by the planned improvement, and (iii) any additional expense to the city services as a result of the improvement; and 
(2)  Must be necessary because capacity cannot be provided efficiently utilizing existing improved property when reasonable allowance is made for necessary improvements; and 
(c)  Property in a reinvestment zone that is owned or leased by a member of the city council or by a member of the city planning commission is excluded from property tax abatement. 
(d)  The city may enter into a property tax abatement agreement with the interested owners of taxable real property for improvements or repairs completed before the city's approval of the tax abatement agreement if: 
(1)  The applicant has complied with the requirements of section 66-143 of this article; and 
(2)  The applicant provides evidence of good cause as to why the city should grant tax abatements for improvements or repairs completed before the city's approval of the tax abatement agreement; and 
(3)  The agreement is consistent with the requirements of subsections (a) through (c) above, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for tax abatement agreements approved under this subsection (d), city council shall determine the year that property tax abatement shall begin.

Projects are eligible for abatement of new value. Under no circumstances will any facility be granted the benefit of a tax abatement for longer than five years. Value subject to abatement must remain greater than or equal to the contractually-defined "minimum value requirement." 
To determine the amount of each year's exemption, the adjusted cap shall be multiplied by a sliding scale as follows:

(3)  All tax abatement agreements shall set out in detail the exact method to be used in computing each year's exemption. 
(4)  No tax abatement shall be given in any year in which the facility fails to meet the employment minimum set forth in section 66-142(h), "basic qualifications for tax abatement" of this article. 
(h)  Basic qualifications for tax abatement. To be eligible for designation as a reinvestment zone and receive tax abatement the planned improvement:

(2)  Must be shown to directly create or prevent the loss of permanent full-time employment for at least ten people within the reinvestment zone upon completion of the contractually-defined "employment period;" 
(3)  Must be shown not to solely or primarily have the effect of transferring employment from one part of city to another. 
(4)  The city may, at its discretion, take into account alternative or competing site information provided with the application for tax abatement. 
(i)  Taxability. From the execution of the abatement to the end of the agreement period, taxes shall be payable as follows:

(2)  The non abatable real property within the reinvestment zone shall be fully taxable each year; 
(3)  Additional value of new eligible property shall be taxable in the manner described in section 66-142(g), "value and term of abatement;" 
(4)  When due to the employment formula (as described in section 66-142(g), "value and term of abatement,"), the maximum amount eligible for abatement ("the cap") is less than the total value of the new facility, the amount of the cap will be reduced each year at the same rate as the taxable improvements are reduced in value from the previous year's value; and 
(5)  Each year's exemption will be computed by HCAD in the following manner: 
a.  The base property value will be the current value of all real property plus fixed-in-place machinery and equipment within the zone that is not subject to abatement. 
b.  The base year value will be subtracted from the value of the abated property plus the base property value, the result to be called current amount eligible for abatement. In no case can this amount exceed the cap set out in the abatement contract. 
c.  The current amount eligible for abatement is then multiplied by the abatement schedule set out in section 66-142(g) to determine the amount of each year's exemption. 
(j)  Environmental and worker safety qualification. In determining whether to grant a tax abatement, consideration will be given to compliance with all state and federal laws designed to protect human health, welfare and the environment ("environmental laws") that are applicable to all facilities in the State of Texas owned or operated by the owner of the facility or lessee, its parent, subsidiaries and, if a joint venture or partnership, every member of the joint venture or partnership ("applicants").

(c)  Upon receipt of a completed application, the city shall notify in writing and provide a copy of the application to the presiding officer of the governing body of each eligible taxing jurisdiction. 
(d)  After receipt of an application for creation of a reinvestment zone and application for abatement, the city shall determine whether the application qualifies for a tax abatement under the terms of these guidelines and criteria.

(3)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting size or weight limits on the national system of interstate and defense highways within the corporate limits of the city in excess of those permitted under 23 USC 127. If the federal government prescribes or adopts vehicle size or weight limits greater than those prescribed by 23 USC 127 for the national system of interstate and defense highways, the increased limits shall become effective on the national system of interstate and defense highways within the corporate limits of the city. 
(4)  In this section, an axle load is defined as the total load transmitted to the road by all wheels whose centers may be included between two parallel transverse vertical planes 40 inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle. Tandem axle group is defined as two or more axles spaced 40 or more inches apart from center to center, having at least one common point of weight suspension. 
(5)  Any weight enforcement officer, having reason to believe that the gross weight or axle load of a loaded motor vehicle is unlawful, is authorized to weigh the vehicle by means of portable or stationary scales approved by the police department of the city for such use, or the weight enforcement officer may cause the loaded motor vehicle to be weighed by any public weigher and may require such vehicle to be driven to the nearest available scales for the purpose of weighing. If the gross weight of a vehicle weighed pursuant to this subsection, is found to exceed the maximum gross weight authorized by law, plus a tolerance allowance of five percent of the gross weight authorized by law, such weight enforcement officer shall demand and require the operator or owner of the motor vehicle to unload, or cause to be unloaded, such portion of the load as is necessary to decrease the gross weight of such vehicle to the maximum permitted by law, plus such tolerance allowance. Such vehicle may not be operated further over the public streets and highways within the city until the gross weight of the vehicle has been reduced to a weight not in excess of the maximum authorized by law plus such tolerance allowance, except as authorized under this subsection. If the axle load of a vehicle weighed pursuant to this subsection, is found to exceed the maximum authorized by law, plus a tolerance allowance of five percent of the axle load authorized by law, such weight enforcement officer shall demand and require the operator or owner of the motor vehicle to decrease the axle load to the maximum authorized by law plus such tolerance allowance.

Such vehicle may not be operated further over the public streets and highways within the city so long as any axle load exceeds the maximum authorized by law plus such tolerance allowance except as authorized under this subsection. If the load of a motor vehicle consists of livestock, the operator shall be permitted to proceed to the destination without unloading providing the destination is within the state. If the gross weight of a motor vehicle or an axle load exceeds the maximum permitted by law, plus a tolerance of five percent of the gross weight authorized by law, but the weight enforcement officer believes that the cargo cannot be unloaded or rearranged safely at the place where such vehicle was weighed, or the weight enforcement officer believes that the unloading or rearranging of the cargo at such place would create an unreasonable disruption of traffic, he shall require the operator to proceed to a location where the cargo can be unloaded or rearranged safely without causing disruption to traffic. Such location shall be the nearest such place on city property, or property under the control of the driver or his principal, or on property where consent has been given for such loading and where it is feasible to unload or rearrange such cargo.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1(exh. A) of Ord. No. 98-2274, adopted Aug. 24, 1998, added provisions to the Code, but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as §§ 70-281-70-289 herein. 
Cross reference- Traffic control devices, § 70-141 et seq. 

Sec. 70-281. - Finding of purpose. 
    Residential neighborhoods are adversely impacted by prevalent occurrences of excessive speed. Traffic humps can be an effective and appropriate device for safely reducing vehicle speeds on certain types of streets when installed in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 98-2274, § 1(exh. A), 8-24-98) 
Sec. 70-282. - Generally. 
    In order for traffic hump installations to be effective, they should be located selectively in accordance with defined traffic engineering criteria for the purpose of alleviating documented speeding problems. Proper installation will also minimize driver frustration and encourage safe driving practices. 
    This article promotes reasonable opportunities for residents and property owners most affected by a proposed traffic hump to participate in the process that leads to its installation. 
(Ord. No. 98-2274, § 1(exh. A), 8-24-98) 
Sec. 70-283. - Definitions and rules of interpretation. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, as used in this article, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:] 
    Applicant refers to the designated representative for the residents petitioning for installation of the traffic hump. 
    Application for traffic humps includes the petition. 
    Director refers to the department head appointed by the city manager to administer this article. 
    Low density residential dwellings include dwellings in single-family houses, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes and fourplex structures. 
    Neighborhood is that area adjoining the street which either fronts on the street or adjoins the street, with or without direct driveway access. 
    Primary route for emergency vehicles refers to a route that is heavily used by police, fire, emergency services and other emergency response vehicles due to the proximity of the emergency vehicle facility. 
    Speeds are 85th percentile speeds as determined by a city-conducted or supervised traffic engineering study according to accepted traffic engineering practices. 
    Street refers to the street length that must be petitioned. It is a 400-foot segment generally centered on the proposed location of the hump(s), or the length of the block, whichever is greater. If the 400-foot segment extends into any part of an adjacent block, it includes the entire length of the adjacent block, unless separated by an intervening thoroughfare, traffic signal, stop sign or offset intersection. 
    Traffic hump is a geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the pavement, the primary purpose of which is to reduce the speed of vehicles travelling along that roadway. 
    All other terms are as defined in the City Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 98-2274, § 1(exh. A), 8-24-98) 
Sec. 70-284. - Eligibility requirements. 
    All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for traffic hump installation: 
(1)  Property usage: The properties located within the neighborhood where the traffic hump is proposed must be primarily developed for, and used as, low-density residential dwellings. 
(2)  Operational characteristics of the street: 
a.  The street must be used to provide access to abutting low-density residential properties (local residential street) and/or to collect traffic for such streets (residential collector). 
b.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
c.  Traffic volumes must be less than 3,000 vehicles per day. 
d.  The street must have a posted or prima facie speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less, as determined in accordance with state law. 
e.  The 85th percentile vehicle speeds must equal or exceed the speed criteria of 35 miles per hour. 
f.  The street must not be an identified primary route for emergency vehicles. These routes are subject to change. 
(3)  Geometric characteristics of the street: 
a.  The street must have adequate sight distances to safely accommodate the traffic hump as determined by the director. 
1.  All traffic humps are to be marked as provided for in the "Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices," supplemented with signage and markings as the director deems necessary and appropriate. 
b.  The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe placement of the hump(s). Humps may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades, but the hump itself must not be located within a horizontal curve, or on a vertical grade greater than eight percent or on their immediate approaches. 
c.  The street must be paved. If no curbs are in place, a specific design must be used to prevent vehicle run-arounds. 
(Ord. No. 98-2274, § 1(exh. A), 8-24-98)

(3)  Upon receipt of the request, the director will make a preliminary determination as to whether the street is eligible for consideration under established eligibility requirements, using available transportation data. Traffic counts and speed studies will not be performed at this time. 
a.  If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing by the director, stating the reason for denial. The decision of the director is final. 
b.  If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration, the director will arrange a meeting with the applicant and affected residents to define the petition area and the approximate traffic hump(s) location(s). At this meeting, the director and the applicant will review the petition and other requirements. The director will also provide at least one copy of the petition form, which must be used. 
c.  The city will give notice that traffic humps are under consideration through the use of door hangers, local newspaper announcements and other means to ensure that affected residents are aware of the proposed installation(s). 
(4)  The petition must document that a minimum of two-thirds of the households in low-density residential dwellings in the neighborhood support its installation. 
a.  The signature of only one adult member of each household will be counted on the petition. 
b.  The petition must include the address of each person signing the petition. 
c.  By signing the petition, residents give advance approval to installation of traffic humps in front of their property, together with necessary signage and no parking requirements. This provision will be prominently stated on the petition form. 
(5)  The applicant must submit a petition on forms provided by the director. 
a.  Upon receipt of the petition, the director will verify that the petition is adequate. 
1.  If the director determines that the petition is not adequate, a written notification of that determination will be provided to the applicant, explaining the inadequacy. 
(6)  After verification of the petition, the director will conduct the necessary traffic engineering studies to determine the traffic volumes and 85th percentile speed, and solicit comments and recommendations of other agencies, which may be impacted by the proposed traffic hump installation. 
a.  Such agencies may include, but are not limited to, La Porte ISD, La Porte Police and Fire Departments, La Porte EMS, and La Porte Public Works Department. 
b.  Traffic engineering studies will be conducted for a minimum of a 24-hour period. The applicant will be encouraged to indicate a weekday or weekend preference for the traffic study to be performed. 
c.  Unless the director determines that the original count did not represent normal conditions or in case of malfunction of the traffic counting device, recounts will not be performed for a period of one year. 
(7)  The director will consider the comments, recommendations and results of all studies for determination as to whether the street is eligible for traffic hump installation. 
a.  If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing of the decision, stating the reason for denial. The decision of the director is final. 
b.  Denied requests may not be resubmitted for a period of one year. 
c.  If the street is determined to be eligible, the street will be placed on a list of streets eligible for traffic hump installation. 
d.  Approved traffic hump requests will be installed as permitted by the available budget. Should funds not be available, the installation will be placed on a list for up to three years. 
(Ord. No. 98-2274, § 1(exh. A), 8-24-98) 
Sec. 70-286. - Traffic hump location. 
(a)  The director will determine the final location of all traffic humps in accordance with the guidelines of this article and safe traffic engineering principles. 
(b)  Traffic humps may be located in front of residences that have signed the petition. Traffic humps will not be placed in front of residences that have not signed the petition, unless the applicant secures written permission from the affected resident. 
(c)  Subsequent occupants of homes where traffic humps have been placed may not request their removal, except as outlined in section 70-287 of this article. 
(d)  The street must have adequate sight distances to safely accommodate the placement of the traffic hump as determined by the director. 
(e)  Traffic humps will normally be placed between 200 and 600 feet apart. Other spacing may be used based upon engineering judgement. The following guidelines will be considered when determining traffic hump placement. 
(1)  On single, short blocks (300 to 500 feet), a single hump positioned near midpoint is usually sufficient. 
(2)  On single blocks of moderate length (500 to 1,000 feet), a two-hump configuration is adequate. 
(3)  On long blocks (over 1,000 feet), three or more humps may be necessary. 
(4)  On lengthy continuous street segments or for humps provided over a series of blocks, interior humps may be placed 400 to 600 feet apart. 
(5)  Traffic humps shall not be located in front of a driveway or within 100 feet of an intersection. 
(f)  Traffic humps should not be located over, or contain, manholes or storm sewer inlets or be located adjacent to fire hydrants. For humps located near drainage inlets the hump should be placed just downstream of the inlet. 
(g)  The advantage of existing or planned street lighting should be considered when determining hump locations. 
(h)  Placement of "no parking" signs within 50 feet of traffic humps may be necessary to ensure warning signs are visible.

Sec. 74-111. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c), below, the IU must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time- proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the CA, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples can composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the CA, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease and temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using the grab collection techniques. 
(c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports require sections 74-101 and 74-103 (40 CFR 403.12(12)(b) and(d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data is available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For report required by paragraphs in Section 74-104 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the IU is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

If a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the article, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of the article or permit. 
(b)  An IU who wishes to establish an act of God affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the article occurred, and the sole cause of the event was an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe; and 
(2)  The IU has submitted the following information to the POTW and the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the article (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five calendar days); 
a.  A description of the event, and the nature and cause of the event; 
b.  The time period of the event, including exact dates and times or, if still continuing, the anticipated time the event is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the event. 
(c)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the IU seeking to establish an act of God affirmative defense shall have burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the article, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe.

DIVISION 15. - INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY SURCHARGE 

Sec. 74-206. - Industrial cost recovery. 
    A permittee discharging industrial wastes with a BOD exceeding 250 mg/l, or a TSS content of greater than 300 mg/l, or both, and meet all other applicable requirements, including those established under this article, may be accepted for waste water disposal provided that; 
(1)  The wastes will not cause damage to the collection system; 
(2)  The wastes will not impair the treatment process. 
(3)  The discharger of the waste enters into a contractual agreement with the CA, via their wastewater discharge permit, providing for a surcharge over and beyond the normal sewer rate. The industrial waste surcharge for industrial discharge is to be calculated as follows: 
IWS = (BOD/250 + TSS/300 × (O & M cost) &times (VOL); IWS = represents industrial waste surcharge in dollars; BOD = represents the biochemical oxygen demand in milligram per liter (mg/l). Note: Concentration less than or equal to 250 mg/l will be considered a value of zero. TSS = represents total suspended solids or suspended solids in milligram per liter (mg/l) Note: Concentration less than zero or equal to 300 mg/l will be considered a value of zero. O&M = Cost represents operation and maintenance cost of POTW wastewater treatment facility. Note: This cost is determined and updated by the city periodically. VOL = represents volume discharged in thousands of gallons. The volume of waste shall be determined by the same methods used to calculate the normal sewer service charge, or by a sewage flow meter that has been approved by the director and purchased, installed, and maintained by the permittee. All flow rates, BOD, total suspended solids and O & M values used in the determination of the industrial waste surcharge shall be reevaluated at least on an annual basis.  
(4)  The industrial waste surcharges provided for in this article shall be included as a separate item on the regular bill for water and sewer charges and shall be paid monthly in accordance with the existing practices. Surcharges shall be paid at the same time that the sewer charges of the permittee become due and payment for sewer services shall not be accepted without payment also of industrial waste surcharges.

Sec. 78-326. - Wrecker rotation list. 
(a)  All auto wrecker or towing service companies desiring to be called for wrecker service by the city police department shall request in writing to be placed on a qualified auto wrecker rotation list to be maintained by the police department. The auto wrecker rotation list shall contain a slot for each company or persons owning a permit or permits to operate auto wreckers in the city. However, a company shall never be entitled to more than one slot on the auto wrecker rotation list, regardless of the number of individual vehicles a company is permitted to operate. The auto wrecker rotation list shall contain the name, address and telephone number of each company. 
(b)  The qualified auto wrecker rotation list shall be used for all vehicles on which a pull is requested by the city police department, except in a nonarrest situation, where the vehicle owner has requested a specific wrecker. 
(c)  When a police officer investigating an accident determines that any vehicle which has been involved in a collision or accident upon a public street is unable to proceed safely under its own power, or when the owner of a vehicle is physically unable to drive such vehicle, the officer shall request the owner to designate the auto wrecker or towing company the owner desires to remove that vehicle. When the owner has designated the wrecker or towing company desired, the police officer shall communicate the fact immediately to police department headquarters, and it shall be the duty of the dispatcher receiving such information at headquarters to call the designated company, provided the company can respond to the location within 20 minutes. If the company cannot respond in the designated time, the owner shall be so informed and given an opportunity to designate another company. 
(d)  If the owner of a vehicle involved in an accident or collision is physically unable to designate the wrecker company desired, or refuses to designate one, the investigating officer shall communicate the fact immediately to police department headquarters. The police department shall maintain a wrecker rotation list which shall contain the names and addresses of each wrecker or towing service company that complies with the provisions of this article in order that such company might be called upon for wrecker service by the police department. The police officer receiving a call at police headquarters for wrecker service shall call the first auto wrecker or towing service company on the list to tow the disabled vehicle or move the vehicle from the public streets of the city. A company holding more than one wrecker or tow truck permit is permitted to respond with any available permitted vehicle, so long as the vehicle selected can respond within the time frame established in subparagraph (e) below. After the company at the top of the list receives a call, then the company's name shall be placed at the bottom of the list and the next company shall be moved to the top of the list and it shall receive calls. This process shall be repeated until each company providing wrecker or towing service under the provisions of this article has received calls. The police department shall notify each wrecker company in sufficient time prior to its rendering such wrecker service in order that the company might adequately provide the necessary men and equipment to answer the calls. Specifically requested wreckers must be duly licensed by the state and able to respond to the scene within a 20-minute time frame. If they cannot respond in that time frame, the officer in charge will advise the requesting party and request a wrecker from the rotating list. 
(e)  If an auto wrecker or towing service company is requested by the police department to make a call and the company agrees to make the call, then the company shall proceed immediately to the scene where it is directed and shall be given a 20-minute time frame to reach such location. If the auto wrecker or towing service company answering the call has not reached the location within 20 minutes, then the officer at the scene may proceed to call the next auto wrecker or towing service company on the list, and that company shall have priority over that particular call. If the auto wrecker or towing service company called fails to comply with the provisions of this article by proceeding to the designated place within the time specified in this subsection, then this auto wrecker or towing service company shall be removed from the top of the list and placed at the bottom of the list. 
(f)  This section only applies to accident scenes and not to custodial arrests. The 20-minute time frame does not apply if the officer in charge deems the situation to be too dangerous in nature to wait that period of time.

( Ord. No. 2016-3633, § 1 , 6-27-16) 
Secs. 86-17-86-24. - Reserved. 
Sec. 86-25. - Open space within subdivisions and developments. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  It is the policy of the city to provide recreational areas and amenities in the form of neighborhood and community parks as a function of residential development in the City of La Porte. This section is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the City of La Porte granted under the Texas Constitution and statutes of the State of Texas, including, without limitation, V.T.C.A. Local Government Code, § 51.071 et seq. and § 212.001 et seq. It is hereby declared by the City Council of the City of La Porte that recreational areas, in the form of neighborhood parks and related amenities and improvements, are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such requirement into the procedure for planning and development of property of a residential subdivision in the City of La Porte, whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and redeveloping existing residential areas. 
Neighborhood and community parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby, the standards for which are set forth in the La Porte Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan, or neighborhood and community areas. The park zones established by the La Porte Parks and Recreation Department and shown on the official La Porte Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan, or neighborhood area, shall be prima facie evidence that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from the majority of residences to be served thereby. The cost of the neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to effect such purposes. 
In order to provide an equitable method of determination of the requirements for future development of residential areas of the City of La Porte, the following formula is hereby adopted: The population of the city based on the latest United States Census data, adjusted on an annual basis based on the predicted growth of the city as found in the parks and open space master plan for the year in which the adjustment is made, is identified. The resultant number is divided by the number of acres of available neighborhood and community parkland inventory in the City of La Porte, resulting in the number of persons per neighborhood or community park acre in the City of La Porte. This result is then divided by the number of La Porte persons per dwelling unit as identified in the latest United States Census data, giving the number of dwelling units per acre of neighborhood or community parkland. This number is then divided into the total acquisition cost for land at the average appraisal value, and development cost per acre for development of the land into a typical park as identified in the parks and open space master plan of the city. 
This formula provides a baseline for determining the number of dwelling units per acre rate for future development within the city, the parkland dedication or in lieu acquisition costs for parkland, and the cost of future park development. This formula shall be applied and reviewed periodically to assure that the process for future development remains fair and equitable as established herein. In the event that the periodic review results in a determination of inequity, an amendment to the ordinance to correct the inequity will be presented to council for consideration. 
(b)  General requirement for dedication of land and payment of park development fee. 
(1)  Whenever a final plat is filed of record with the County Clerk of Harris County, Texas, or a development site plan, or a property survey is submitted and filed with the approving authority of the city in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other planning and development ordinances that may be contained within the Code of Ordinances of the City of La Porte, for a development of a residential area within the City of La Porte that contains one or more residential dwelling units, such plat, or site plan, or property survey shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of one acre of land for each 93 proposed dwelling units. As used in this section, a "dwelling unit" means each individual residence, including individual residences in a multi-family structure, designed and/or intended for inhabitation by a single family. Residential structures that are moved from one area of the city to another area of the city are specifically excluded from the park development fee requirements of this chapter. 
Any proposed plat or site plan, or property survey submitted to the City of La Porte for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. The required land dedication of this section may be met by a payment in lieu of land where permitted by the City of La Porte or required by other provisions in this chapter. 
In the event a plat is not required and a development site plan or property survey is filed, the dedication of land or payment in lieu of land required under this section shall be met prior to the issuance of a building permit by the approving authority of the city. 
(2)  The City Council of the City of La Porte declares that development of an area less than one acre for neighborhood park purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than 93 dwelling units are proposed by a plat filed for approval, the approving authority may require the developer to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount, as provided in subsection (c) below. 
(3)  In addition to the required dedication of land, as set forth above, there shall also be a park development fee paid to the City of La Porte as a condition to subdivision plat approval or issuance of a building permit. Such park development fee shall be set from time to time by ordinance of the City Council of the City of La Porte sufficient to provide for the development of amenities and improvements on the dedicated land to meet the standards for a neighborhood park to serve the area in which the subdivision is located. Unless and until changed by ordinance of the City Council of the City of La Porte, the park development fee shall be calculated on the basis of $318.00 per dwelling unit. 
(4)  In lieu of payment of the required park development fee, a developer shall have the option to construct the neighborhood park amenities and improvements. All plans and specifications for the construction of such amenities and improvements must be reviewed and approved by the approving authority. The developer shall financially guarantee the construction of the amenities and improvements, and the City of La Porte must approve same, prior to the filing of a plat in the case of platted subdivisions. Once the amenities and improvements are constructed, and after the approving authority has accepted such amenities and improvements, the developer shall deed and convey such amenities and improvements to the City of La Porte or to the applicable homeowner's association. 
(5)  In instances where land is required to be dedicated, the approving authority shall have the right to accept or reject the dedication after consideration of the recommendation of the parks and recreation director or the planning and zoning commission, and to require a cash payment in lieu of land in the amount provided under subsection (c) below, if the approving authority determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development or if the recreation potential for that area would be better served by expanding or improving existing neighborhood parks. 
(6)  When two or more developments will be necessary to create a neighborhood park of sufficient size in the same area, the parks and recreation department, at the time of preliminary plat approval, will work with the developer to define the optimum location of the required dedication within the respective plats. Once a park site has been determined, adjacent property owners who develop around the park site shall dedicate land and (or) cash to the existing site unless otherwise determined by the approving authority, as provided herein. 
(c)  Cash payment in lieu of land. 
(1)  A developer responsible for land dedication under this section shall be required, at the approving authority's option, to meet the dedication requirements in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land, in the amount set forth below. Such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to filing the final plat for record, or prior to the issuance of a building permit where a plat is not required. 
(2)  The cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall be met by the payment of a fee set from time to time by ordinance of the city council sufficient to acquire neighborhood parkland. Unless and until changed by the city council, such fee shall be computed on the basis of $490.00 per dwelling unit. A cash payment in lieu of land dedication, as set forth in this section, does not relieve the developer of its obligation to pay the park development fee of $318.00 set forth in subsection (b)(3) above.

Sec. 94-33. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of La Porte, Texas are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-34. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

    In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be; (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-38. - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the current scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for City of La Porte, Texas" dated June 18, 2007, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and/or flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and/or FBFM) dated June 18, 2007, and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. A true and correct copy of said study and maps is on file in the office of the City Engineer of the City of La Porte. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-39. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-40. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-41. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

Sec. 94-89. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 94-38, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 94-63 are satisfied.

Sec. 94-90. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 94-38 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If section 94-90(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-91. - Coastal high hazard areas. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 94-38 of this chapter are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (zones V1-30, VE, and/or V). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions outlined in this chapter, the following provisions must also apply: 
(1)  Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
(2)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
(i)  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; 
(ii)  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of (3)(i) and (ii) of this section. 
(4)  Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
(i)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
(ii)  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. Such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation. 
(5)  Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings. 
(6)  Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands that increase potential flood damage. 
(7)  Manufactured homes. Require that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved within zone V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, meet the standards of paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM meet the requirements of subsection 94-87(4) of this article. 
(8)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the requirements in section 94-63 of this article and paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 3236, § 1, 4-26-10) 
Sec. 94-92. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each violation, with each day constituting a separate violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent City of La Porte from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

It shall be the responsibility of the planning and zoning commission and the board of adjustment to assist the city council in achieving this goal by advising the city council of their recommendations thereon. As necessary, the city council may from time to time on its own motion or upon cause presented by interested property owners inquire into the existence, continuation or maintenance of any nonconforming use within the city. 
(1)  Conforming use does not change to nonconforming use if adjacent property subsequently changes zoning classification. A use that conforms to the zoning regulations on the effective date of this zoning ordinance at the time of initial development of the site shall not subsequently be deemed a nonconforming use solely because the use changes on an adjoining property. 
(2)  Accessory use of structure. No structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or a nonconforming structure shall continue after such principal use or structure has been terminated, removed or otherwise brought into compliance, unless it complies with all of the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
Sec. 106-262. - Nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Limitation on regulation. No structure, otherwise in accordance with the provisions of these regulations or an amendment hereto, shall be rendered or be deemed a nonconforming structure solely for a failure to comply with provisions relating to Article V, Division 2, Accessory Buildings, Uses, and Equipment, of this chapter. 
(b)  Continuance of nonconforming structures. Subject to all limitations herein set forth, any nonconforming structure may be occupied and operated and maintained in a state of good repair, but no nonconforming structure shall be enlarged unless the enlargement is made in accordance with the provisions of section 106-262(g) (Enlargement to non-conforming structure) of this chapter. 
(c)  Accidental damage to structure. If a building occupied by nonconforming uses is destroyed by fire or the elements, it may not be reconstructed or rebuilt unless it conforms with the provisions of this chapter. In the case of partial destruction by fire or other causes, not exceeding 50 percent of its value, as determined by a licensed appraiser, the enforcing officer of the city may issue a permit for reconstruction. If greater than 50 percent and less than total, the board may grant as a special exception a permit for repairs but not for enlargement or reconstruction of the building. 
(d)  Obsolescence of structure. The right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure becomes substandard under the codes and ordinances of the city, and the cost of placing such structure in lawful compliance with the applicable ordinances exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost of such structure, as determined by a licensed appraiser, on the date that the enforcing officer determines that such structure is obsolete or substandard. The enforcement officer of the city shall notify the owner of such nonconforming structure, as shown on the certified tax rolls of the city, as to the date of termination of the right to operate and maintain such nonconforming structure, and as to the procedure to be followed to bring such structure into compliance with this chapter, or other codes and ordinances of the city. The burden of proof in showing that the structure's repair cost does not exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of such structure rests upon the owner of such structure. The owner may appeal to the ZBOA within 60 days of the city notification. 
(e)  Determination of replacement cost. In determining the replacement cost of any nonconforming structure, the cost of land or any factors other than the nonconforming structure itself, shall not be included. 
(f)  Repairs and alterations. Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or structure; provided, that the footprint of the building is not enlarged, unless the building is changed to a conforming use. No additional dwelling units shall be added where the nonconforming use results from there being more dwelling units on the lot than is permissible in the district in which the building is located. 
(g)  Enlargement to nonconforming structure. A structure that is nonconforming may be altered, remodeled or otherwise improved, but not enlarged, unless the board of adjustment determines (pursuant to section 106-191 (Special exceptions)) that such enlargement will not result in an increase in the degree of nonconformity with the regulations and development standards of the district in which it is located. 
(1)  Submission of schedule to eliminate nonconformity. The applicant shall present to the board of adjustment a schedule for elimination or substantial reduction of the nonconformity over a reasonable period of time not to exceed 20 years, or setting forth the reasons why such action is not reasonably possible. 
(2)  Approval of schedule by board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall review and make any revisions found necessary to ensure that priority is given to elimination or reduction of those nonconformities that have significant adverse impacts on surrounding properties, and which can reasonably be ameliorated taking into account the effect of the configuration of the lot and the location of existing structures and the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing such nonconformities. 
(h)  Abandonment of nonconforming use or nonconforming structure. 
(1)  A nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned when the use ceases to be used for the nonconformity for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days. The nonconforming use, when abandoned, shall not resume. 
(2)  A nonconforming structure shall be deemed abandoned when the structure ceases to be used for the nonconformity for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days. The use of the nonconforming structure, when abandoned, shall not resume. 
(3)  When it has been determined by the enforcement officer that a nonconforming use or structure has been abandoned, notification shall be made by certified mail to the owner (as shown on the certified tax rolls) of the abandoned nonconforming use or structure. The owner or his representative seeking to maintain such nonconforming use or structure may appeal the enforcement officer's decision to the board of adjustment. The property owner or his representative seeking to maintain the existing nonconforming structure shall have the burden of proving to the board of adjustment in such appeal that the structure or use has not been abandoned for a period of 180 consecutive calendar days, and that the owner or his representative did not intend to abandon the nonconforming structure or use during said 180-day period. 
Sec. 106-263. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Continuance of nonconforming uses subject to this chapter. Subject to the provisions of this chapter relating to extended useful life of nonconforming uses, any nonconforming use may be continued in operation on the same land area and on the same floor in a structure or structures which were occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective date of this ordinance, provided that such land area or floor area shall not be increased, except that such limitation shall not apply for farming uses. 
(b)  Changing a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use or structure may be changed to a use conforming to the regulations established in this chapter for the district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located, or the nonconforming use or structure may be changed to a use or structure more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located. For purposes of this section, the term "more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located" shall mean a less intense use (per the North American Industry Classification System). Whether or not a use is more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located is a question to be determined by the planning director, subject to appeal as provided within this article. A nonconforming use or structure so changed shall not thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use or structure. 
Sec. 106-264. - Notification of nonconforming status. 
(a)  Owners and occupants of property subject to extended useful life and/or termination of nonconforming status pursuant to this division shall be notified of such status by the planning director of the city. The planning director shall mail written notice, prior to or concurrently with the notice of public hearing pursuant to section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination), to all persons having an interest in property (as shown by the tax rolls of the city) where the property is located and to the occupant of each nonconforming use in the city by regular and by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall state that the use is subject to a determination of its extended useful life and termination requirements and shall specify the procedures for obtaining an exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements of sections 106-265 (Application for exemption from extended useful life request) and 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). 
(b)  Changing a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use or structure may be changed to a use conforming to the regulations established in this chapter for the district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located, or the nonconforming use or structure may be changed to a use or structure more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located. For purposes of this section, the term "more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located" shall mean a less intense use (per the North American Industry Classification System). Whether or not a use is more conforming to the zoning district in which the nonconforming use or structure is located is a question to be determined by the planning director, subject to appeal as provided within this article. A nonconforming use or structure so changed shall not thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use or structure. 
( Ord. No. 2016-3631, § 4 , 5-23-16) 
Sec. 106-265. - Application for exemption from extended useful life requirement. 
(a)  Application requirements. An owner or qualified occupant of a nonconforming use or structure may seek an exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements of section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). The grounds upon which such an exemption may be sought shall be either: (i) that the nonconforming use or structure has no adverse impact upon allowed land uses in the district in which it is located; or (ii) that the nonconforming use or structure can be made compatible with such surrounding uses upon compliance with specified conditions. Such owner or qualified occupant shall submit an application to the planning director, on a form provided by the planning director, no less than ten working days prior to the date scheduled for the public hearing being conducted pursuant to section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). 
(b)  Board review and decision. The board of adjustment shall hold the public hearing pursuant to section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination), following the procedures for hearings before the zoning board of adjustment established in the zoning ordinance; and shall consider the application for an exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements of section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). The owner or qualified occupant shall have the burden of proving the grounds for the exemption sought. Upon conclusion of the hearing, if the board of adjustment finds that the use of the property has no material adverse impact upon the land uses permitted in the district in which it is located or can be made reasonably compatible with such uses through the imposition of specified conditions, it shall exempt the nonconforming use from the extended useful life and termination requirements of section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination), and impose such conditions as it finds necessary to ensure reasonable compatibility with surrounding properties and uses, including, but not limited to: (i) required improvement of (or modifications to) existing improvements on the property; or (ii) limitations on hours or nature of operations; and (iii) a specified term of years for which the exemption shall be granted. 
    If the board of adjustment does not authorize an exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements of section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination), it shall after considering applicable law, information presented at the hearing and other factors deemed relevant by it, establish an extended useful life period for the nonconforming use in accordance with section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). 
(c)  Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment or a taxpayer or an officer, department, board or bureau of the city, may appeal the decision in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011. Unless properly appealed within ten days of the date the decision is filed in the board of adjustment's office, the decision of the board of adjustment is final and incontestable. 
Sec. 106-266. - Extended useful life and termination. 
(a)  Extended useful life of specific nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses shall be terminated at the end of an extended useful life period established by the board of adjustment in accordance with this section. The extended useful life period to be established shall not be less than five years, nor more than 20 years from the effective date of the order of the board of adjustment, unless the board determines on the basis of expert appraisal testimony that a greater extended useful life period is necessary to enable the property owner to recoup the current remaining useful investment in the property made prior to the date of the order of the board of adjustment establishing the extended useful life period. The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing, as required by subsection (b) below, to establish an extended useful life period or to consider an application by the nonconforming user for exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements set forth in this section 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination). If the board of adjustment grants an exemption, the use shall be known as an "exempted nonconforming use." If the board of adjustment does not grant an exemption, it shall establish an extended useful life period subsequent to the hearing procedure established in subsection (b). If an application for exemption from extended useful life is not submitted, the board of adjustment shall establish an extended useful life period pursuant to subsection (c). 
(b)  Public hearing. 
(1)  The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing to establish an extended useful life for each nonconforming use subject to notification pursuant to section 106-264 (Notification of nonconforming status), or to consider an application for an exemption from the extended useful life and termination requirements of this section as allowed in section 106-265 (Application for exemption from extended useful life requirement) and this section, but subject to the following notification requirements: 
a.  Written notice of the time and place of a public hearing, by certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to the owner and occupant of the nonconforming use at least 30 days prior to the date of such public hearing; 
b.  Publication at least 30 days prior to the date of public hearing of a notice of the time and place of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the city; and 
c.  Mailing of the notice of public hearing at least 60 days prior to the date of the public hearing to property owners within 200 feet, as determined pursuant to section 106-89 (Appeals to board of adjustment), of the lot line of the land subject to the application, inclusive of streets, alleys and rights-of-way, and to civic associations, whose boundaries are wholly or partly within said 200 foot area. 
(2)  Upon notification of the time and place of the public hearing, the owner or occupant of the nonconforming use to be subject to the extended useful life requirements of this ordinance may apply to the planning director for an exemption from extended useful life and termination pursuant to section 106-265 (Application for exemption from extended useful life requirement) and include written information and documentation supporting a claim for an exemption from any extended useful life period. In the event the board of adjustment does not grant the exemption applied for, it shall establish an extended useful life period based on (i) applicable law, (ii) evidence submitted with the application, (iii) evidence presented at the hearing and (iv) other factors consistent with the purpose of this zoning ordinance to allow the owner to recoup the current remaining useful investment in the use made prior to the effective date of the order of the board of adjustment establishing the extended useful life period, specifically including but not limited to the testimony of experts in the field of property appraisal. The owner's or applicant's failure to submit evidence to support an extended useful life period shall be considered a waiver by the owner or applicant of any right to contest at the board of adjustment the length of any extended useful life period that the board of adjustment establishes. 
(c)  Extended useful life period. In the event the owner or qualified occupant does not apply for exemption from an extended useful life period, the board of adjustment, at the public hearing, shall establish an extended useful life period based on (i) applicable law, (ii) evidence presented at the public hearing and (iii) other factors deemed relevant by the board of adjustment, to allow the owner or qualified applicant to recoup the current remaining useful investment in the use made prior to the effective date of this zoning ordinance, specifically including but not limited to testimony of experts in the field of property appraisal. The extended useful life shall not be for less than five years nor more than 20 years from the effective date of the useful life period, unless the board determines upon the basis of testimony from experts in the field of property appraisal presented at the public hearing, that an extension of the useful life period is necessary to enable the property owner to recoup the current remaining useful investment in the property made prior to the date of the order of the board of adjustment establishing the extended useful life period. 
(d)  End of extended useful life period. At the end of the extended useful life period established by the board of adjustment for a particular use, the use shall terminate. 
Sec. 106-267. - Revocation of nonconforming use status. 
    Upon the recommendation of the planning director or a motion of the board of adjustment, the board of adjustment shall undertake a review of (i) any nonconforming uses; or (ii) any exempted nonconforming uses established pursuant to section 106-265 (Application for exemption from extended useful life requirement) or 106-266 (Extended useful life and termination) and, after a public hearing and investigation as to the particular use in question, may require the revocation of the use status and the extended useful life period or may order the termination of such use. For purposes of this section 106-267 (Revocation of nonconforming use status), a use described in (i) or (ii) above, shall be herein sometimes referred to as a "revocable use." 
(1)  Initiation of revocation procedure. The board of adjustment shall undertake a review of any revocable use only upon: (i) its own motion, upon a determination that a reasonable probability of one or more grounds for termination under section 106-267(3) (Required findings and standards in board-determination of revocation) exist; or (ii) a report from the planning director recommending revocation of such revocable use, which shall be based upon a determination that a reasonable probability of one or more grounds for termination under 106-267(3) (Required findings and standards in board-determination of revocation) exist for such recommendation. 
(2)  Board notice, review and decision. Upon its own motion, or upon receipt of the planning director's report recommending the revocation of the status of the revocable use, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing to consider revocation of a revocable use. Prior to holding such hearing, the board of adjustment shall provide public notice as follows: 
a.  Written notice of the time and place of a public hearing, by certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to all persons having an interest in the property as shown by the certified tax rolls of the city and to the occupant or occupants of the property containing said revocable use at least 30 days prior to the date of such public hearing; 
b.  Publication at least 30 days prior to the public hearing of a notice of the time and place of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the city; and 
c.  Mailing of the notice of public hearing at least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing to property owners within 200 feet as determined pursuant to section 106-89 (Appeals to board of adjustment), of the lot line of the land subject to the application, inclusive of streets, alleys and rights-of-way, and to civic associations registered with the planning director, whose boundaries are wholly or partly within the 200 foot area. 
Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the board of adjustment shall determine, on the basis of written findings of fact and conclusions, whether the status of the revocable use should be revoked and the use amortized or terminated. In making its determination whether or not to revoke, the board of adjustment shall consider the standards set forth in section 106-267(3) (Required findings and standards in board-determination of revocation), and if it determines to revoke, it shall, in accordance with applicable law, after considering evidence presented at the hearing and other factors consistent with the purpose of this zoning ordinance, establish an extended useful life period for the owner to recoup the current remaining useful investment in the use made by the owner prior to the time the use became nonconforming, in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The revocable use shall terminate at the end of the extended useful life period or the termination date, as the case may be, as established by the board of adjustment. 
(3)  Required findings and standards in board-determination of revocation. To support a finding and conclusion that revokes the status of a revocable use based on written findings of fact and conclusions, the board of adjustment must find any of the following (i) a violation of any condition imposed by the board of adjustment pursuant to section 106-265(b) (Board review and decision); (ii) that the continuation of the revocable use materially and continuously interferes in an adverse manner with the implementation of the legislative purposes of the zoning district in which the use is located, or (iii) a pattern of repeated occurrences of one or more of the following with respect to the revocable use: 
a.  Noise above the maximum permissible limits, as set forth in the zoning ordinance, or in any other city ordinance; 
b.  Traffic generation of more than twice that of the same use or use of a similar nature, based on rates set forth in the most recent edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual; 
c.  Noxious or annoying emissions of odor, smoke, wastewater, light or other matters; 
d.  Hours of operation that begin prior to 7:00 a.m. and extend beyond 10:00 p.m. and as such exacerbate general noise or traffic; 
e.  Lack of substantial compliance with applicable city codes and ordinances; 
f.  Police reports on alleged criminal activity associated with the nonconforming use; or 
g.  Similar factors. 
(4)  Nonconforming uses not subject to revocation of status. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section 106-267 (Revocation of nonconforming uses status) that could be construed to the contrary, a residential use that is nonconforming in the particular district in which such use is located shall not be subject to revocation under this section 106-267 (Revocation of nonconforming use status). 
(5)  Conditions for continuation. In making a decision not to revoke the status of a revocable use pursuant to section 106-267(3) (Required findings and standards in board-determination of revocation) the board of adjustment may impose conditions on the use that are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section, including, but not limited to required improvement of, or modifications to, existing improvements on the property or limitations on hours or nature of operations. 
(6)  Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment, or a taxpayer, or an officer, department, board or bureau of the city may appeal the decision in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011. The decision of the board of adjustment is final and incontestable unless appealed to the district court within ten days after the date the decision is filed in the board of adjustment's office. 
Sec. 106-268. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  Continuance of nonconforming lots of record. Subject to all limitations herein set forth, any nonconforming lot may continue without change in boundaries and may be utilized or developed provided that the uses and development are otherwise authorized as provided herein. No new structure shall be placed thereon except in conformity with the applicable controls of the district in which the lot is located. No new use may be undertaken on nonconforming lots of record, unless said change in use or is first submitted to the planning director for review. The planning director shall review said proposed change in use, for purposes of insuring compliance with this chapter, taking into account the particular restraints imposed by the degree of nonconformity of said nonconforming lot of record. The director's review shall include, and be limited to required parking, loading, vehicular access, landscaping, setbacks, utility availability, parking lot surfacing for required parking, dumpster enclosures, and other requirements as imposed by this chapter. 
    Decisions of the planning director made pursuant to provisions contained in this section are subject to appeal to the board of adjustment as provided in section 106-89 (Appeals to board of adjustment) of this chapter. 
(b)  Discontinuance of nonconforming lots of record. Any lot which is made conforming by combining with other lots for purpose of sale or development, or by development, or by subdividing, thereafter shall be recognized as a conforming lot and shall comply in full with the provisions of these regulations; provided however, that a nonconforming lot of record that is made conforming shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming lot. 
Sec. 106-269. - Zoning of annexed property. 
(a)  Temporary R-1 classification of annexed property. All territory annexed hereafter to the city shall be temporarily classified as R-1 low density residential, only until permanently zoned by the La Porte City Council. Immediately after the annexation of any territory to the City of La Porte, the city planning and zoning commission shall commence any action necessary to recommend to the city council a permanent zoning classification. The procedure for making permanent such classification shall be the same as is provided by law for the adoption of the original zoning regulations, and shall take place within 180 days from the date of annexation. 
(b)  Developments presented to city prior to annexation. In the event a development or subdivision is presented to the city planning and zoning commission prior to annexation, that specifies a particular land use, the planning and zoning commission may recommend zoning categories to the city council, after hearing, so that permanent zoning may be considered simultaneously and in conjunction with the annexation proceedings. 
(c)  Issuance of building permits in annexed areas. In an area temporarily classified as R-1 low density residential, a building permit may be issued for the construction of structures or uses permitted by low density residential district regulations, however, other structures or uses are not permitted unless application for such structures or use is made to the city planning and zoning commission for consideration and recommendation to the city council.

    If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and Local Government Code § 211.006, changes are made in the district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning maps, such changes shall be entered on the official zoning maps by the planning and development department promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council. 
Sec. 106-303. - Zoning map change procedures. 
    Approved zoning changes shall be entered on the official zoning maps by the director of planning and development or his designated representative and each change shall be identified on the maps with the date and number of the ordinance making the change. No amendment to this chapter which involves matter portrayed on the official zoning maps shall become effective until after such ordinance has been finally approved by the city council. 
Sec. 106-304. - Unauthorized map changes. 
    No change of any nature shall be made on the official zoning maps or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this chapter. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered null and void. 
Sec. 106-305. - Location and authority of zoning maps. 
    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning maps which may from time to time be made public or published, the official zoning maps shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the city. The official zoning maps shall be available to the public at all hours when the City Hall is open to the public. 
Sec. 106-306. - Replacement of the zoning maps. 
    In the event that the official zoning maps become damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and/or number of changes and additions, the city council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map based on review and a written report from the planning and zoning commission, which shall supersede the prior official zoning maps. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning maps, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city secretary, and bearing the seal of the city and date under the following words: 
"This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of the map being replaced) as part of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of La Porte, Texas." 
Sec. 106-307. - Zoning map history. 
    Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map, as superseded in accordance with section 106-306 (Replacement of the zoning maps), or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
Sec. 106-308. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
    In determining the location of zoning district boundaries on the official zoning map accompanying and made a part of these regulations, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Where boundaries are shown to follow streets or alleys, the centerline of such streets or alleys as they exist at the time of adoption of these regulations shall be the zoning boundary. 
(2)  Where boundaries are shown to enter on cross platted blocks, property lines of lots, as they exist at the time of adoption of these regulations, shall be the zoning boundary. 
(3)  In case of a district boundary line dividing a tract of property into two parts, the district boundary line shall be construed to be the property line nearest the district boundary line as shown. However, if the owner and/or developer of two or more contiguous tracts of property replats or combines such tracts in a manner to consolidate the tracts into one parcel resulting in the consolidated tract being divided by a district boundary into two parts, then in such cases the district boundary line shall be enforced at the location shown on the zoning map. 
(4)  Where boundaries are shown on unsubdivided property, the location shall be determined by use of the scale shown on the zoning map unless dimensions are given on the zoning map.

The city encourages site planning which furthers the preservation of trees and natural areas by the following methods: To protect trees during construction; to facilitate site design and construction which contributes to the long term viability of existing trees; and to control premature removal of trees; require on-site replacement of trees that must be removed and require off-site replacement of trees that cannot be replaced on-site, either by direct planting as outlined in section 106-802 (tree replacement) or through a contribution to the tree fund established in section 106-803 (tree fund) of this chapter. It is the further intent of this section to achieve the following objectives: 
(1)  Protect healthy trees and preserve the natural, environmental, and aesthetic qualities of the city to the degree possible. 
(2)  Protect and increase the value of residential and commercial properties within the city. 
(3)  Discourage premature clear-cutting of property. 
(4)  Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new developments to the city. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit the destruction of any healthy, native tree (herein referred to as a "protected tree") within the city if such tree has a trunk which exceeds six inches in diameter (or 18.84-inch circumference) at a point 18 inches above the natural ground level. Provided, however, it shall not be a violation of this provision if a tree is removed and/or destroyed if the tree is obviously diseased or determined to be diseased by an arborist or in the opinion of the planning director or his designated representative, said tree constitutes a hazard to pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic along any such right-of-way. 
(c)  No person, firm or corporation desirous of developing or improving any parcel of property, shall remove or cause the removal of any tree from said property without first obtaining a clearing permit which would allow clearing of buildable areas only. 
(d)  The provisions of this section are not applicable to individual single family lots. 
( Ord. No. 2015-3609, § 1 , 10-26-15) 
Sec. 106-802. - Tree replacement. 
    A tree disposition plan or tree survey must be submitted and approved prior to the removal or destruction of any qualifying protected tree. In the event that it is necessary to remove a protected tree, as a condition of a building permit issuance, applicant shall be required to replace the tree(s) being removed with replacement trees as follows: 
(a)  Replacement trees required. Tree disposition conditions and tree permit authorizing removal of or damage to protected trees shall normally require replacement by one or more newly planted trees on the same subject site. If this is not feasible, the owner or developer must plant and maintain off-site replacement trees in reasonable proximity to the subject site. 
(b)  Number of replacement trees. For each qualifying protected tree removed from the site, one replacement tree must be planted on the subject site. If this is not feasible, the applicant may, upon approval by the director, plant and maintain off-site replacement trees in accordance with this section, or alternatively, contribute to the city's tree fund. 
(c)  Minimum size. Replacement trees must normally have a trunk caliper of at least two inches measured six inches from the ground, with the exception of replacement trees installed on properties in any designated industrial zone district, in which case the trunk caliper shall be a minimum of four inches as measured six inches from the ground. The enforcement officer may prescribe a proportionally smaller trunk caliper for certain species of trees, i.e. Crepe Myrtle. 
(d)  Qualified trees. To be a "qualified tree", a tree must comply with the recommended tree list "native or protected" of the city. 
(e)  Standard of review. The enforcement officer shall use reasonable best efforts to determine the type and number of replacement trees required in an attempt to minimize undue burden resulting from this section. 
(f)  Trees in street area. Before authorizing establishment or maintenance of tree or decorative landscaping, such as lighting or a watering system in a street area, the building official must be satisfied that V.T.C.A. Transportation Code, ch. 316 has been complied with and also confirms there would be no violation of the provisions relating to visibility triangles and future overhead obstruction. 
(g)  Single family lots. The provisions of this section are not applicable to individual single family lots.

All revenues, mitigation fees, and penalties received pursuant to this section, or for the enforcement thereof, and any donations or grant monies received to achieve the purpose of tree preservation or replacement, shall be deposited into the tree fund. Monies in the tree fund may be used to purchase trees required for replacement but may not be used in any manner that will profit the grantee. Tree replacement fee shall be calculated at the rate of $250.00 per tree. The amount paid to the tree fund shall be applied at a maximum of $2,500.00 per acre (or fraction thereof) with a maximum total payment of $100,000.00 per development. 
    The owner or developer of any lot or tract of land required to replace trees in accordance with this chapter may, as an alternative, and upon approval by the city, pay a prescribed fee/amount into the tree fund in accordance with the following conditions: 
(1)  Residential and non-residential site plans/plats. Payment to the tree fund must be received by the city prior to the approval of the development site plan and/or final plat approval by the planning and zoning commission.
