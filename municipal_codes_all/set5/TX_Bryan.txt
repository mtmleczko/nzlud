PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bryan, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Code, as supplemented through September 28, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 and 1988 Codes, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Luke A. Saarela, Code Attorney, and Francine King, Code Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mary Lynne Stratta and Jodi Hughes Chaney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(a)  On the terms and conditions set out in Sections 854.203 and 853.404 of Subtitle G of Title 8, Government Code, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the "TMRS Act"), the city hereby elects to allow and to provide for payment of the increases below stated in monthly benefits payable by the system to retired employees and to beneficiaries of deceased employees of the city under current service annuities and prior service annuities arising from service by such employees to the city.

    Pursuant to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(g), the city adopts the following provisions affecting participation of its employees in the Texas Municipal Retirement System:

Prior to adopting Ordinance No. 1075, from which this section is derived, the governing body of the city has: 
a.  Prepared an actuarial analysis of member retirement annuities at 20 years of service, and 
b.  Held a public hearing pursuant to the notice provisions of the Texas Open Meetings Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 551.

If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at that date under a joint and survivor annuity (Option 1) payable during the lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse. 
(3)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of any annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (2) of this section applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(4)  The rights hereinabove authorized shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of Ordinance No. 1075 (January 1, 1998) pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(5)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a standard occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.408, or an optional occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.410, upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to said board of trustees: 
a.  That the member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; 
b.  That the disability is likely to be permanent; and 
c.  That the member should be retired.

(Code 1988, § 2-469; Ord. No. 715, § 1, 11-14-1988; Ord. No. 1075, § 5, 9-23-1997)

(a)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the Texas Municipal Retirement System and who performed service as a probationary employee for this city prior to September 1, 1989, for which the employee did not receive credited service in the system because the person, a probationary employee was not enrolled as a member of the system is hereby allowed to obtain prior service credit for the probationary period of such service, pursuant to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.304. 
(b)  To obtain prior service credit allowable under subsection (a) of this section any employee entitled thereto shall file a detailed written statement of the service claimed with the city secretary within one year from the effective date of this section. 
(c)  As soon as practicable after the employee has filed a claim the prior service credit under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.304, the city personnel officer shall, if said officer determines that such service was performed as claimed, verify the prior service allowable (not to exceed six months) and the average monthly compensation paid the member during this period of employment, and shall certify to the board of trustees of the system the creditable prior service approved, and the average monthly compensation paid to the person by the city during this period of employment.

The city agrees that its account in the municipality accumulation fund is to be charged at the time of the member's retirement with an amount equal to the accumulated amount paid by the member for military service credit, multiplied by the city's current service matching ratio in effect at the date the member applies for such military service credit.

ARTICLE IV. - DROUGHT CONTINGENCY AND WATER EMERGENCY PLAN 

Sec. 26-81. - Introduction. 
    Safe, high quality drinking water is a precious resource in the Bryan-College Station region. This drought contingency and water emergency plan (the "plan") requires that the available water resources of the city be put to maximum beneficial use to protect the integrity of the water supply, with particular regard to domestic water use, sanitation, fire protection, as well as to protect and preserve public welfare, safety and to minimize the adverse impacts of water supply shortage or other emergency conditions. The city is located within the Brazos Region Water Planning Group, Region G. A copy of this plan has been provided to the Brazos Region Water Planning Group, Region G, as well as the Brazos Valley Ground Water District. Water uses regulated or prohibited under this plan are considered to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of water shortages or other emergency water supply conditions are deemed to constitute a waste of water which subjects the offender to penalties as defined in section 26-90. 
(Code 1988, § 8-61; Ord. No. 1362, § 1, 8-13-2002; Ord. No. 1532, Exhibit A, § A, 5-24-2005)

Sec. 26-85. - Trigger conditions. 
    Daily water demand will be monitored for emergency conditions by the city. Trigger conditions will be based on an emergency situation caused by a natural disaster, equipment or system failure, or high daily average water demand. The city manager or his or her designee, on recommendation of the Department of Environmental Services, shall determine when conditions warrant initiation or termination of each stage of the plan. In the spirit of cooperation, interconnections between the Cities of Bryan and College Station may be utilized to provide water in emergency conditions provided it does not create an additional emergency situation for either city. This shared water resource shall be evaluated and/or implemented prior to initiation of the trigger conditions. The trigger conditions described below are based on the fact that the city uses groundwater as its water supply, and therefore, will likely be constrained by system capacity before shortage of supply. 
(1)  Stage 1, voluntary water conservation conditions: 
a.  Requirements for initiation. Customers shall be requested to voluntarily conserve water and adhere to the water restrictions on nonessential water use, as outlined in section 26-87 (stage 1), each year from May 1 through September 30. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 1 of the plan may be rescinded at any time by the city manager or his or her designee. 
(2)  Stage 2, moderate water shortage conditions: 
a.  Requirements for initiation. Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and restrictions on nonessential water uses, as outlined in section 26-87(2) (stage 2), when: 
1.  Average daily water consumption for three consecutive days reaches 90 percent of production/distribution capacity of the city. 
2.  Weather conditions are to be considered in drought classification determination. Predicted long, cold, or dry periods are to be considered in impact analysis. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 2 of the plan may be rescinded by the city manager or his or her designee when all of the conditions listed as triggering events have ceased to exist for a period of three consecutive days. Upon termination of stage 2, stage 1 becomes operative. 
(3)  Stage 3, severe water shortage conditions: 
a.  Requirements for initiation . Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and restrictions on nonessential water uses, as outlined in section 26-87(3) (stage 3), when: 
1.  The city average daily water consumption for three consecutive days reaches 95 percent of production/distribution capacity of the system, and/or the city daily water consumption will not enable storage levels to be maintained, i.e., system demand exceeds available high service pump capacity. 
2.  The city water system is contaminated whether accidentally or intentionally. Severe condition is reached immediately upon detection. 
3.  The city water system fails from acts of God (tornadoes, hurricanes) or man. Severe condition is reached immediately upon detection. 
4.  Any mechanical failure of pumping equipment or system component failure which will require more than 12 hours to repair which causes a loss of capability to provide water service in the city. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 3 of the plan may be rescinded by the city manager or his or her designee when all of the conditions listed as triggering events have ceased to exist for a period of three consecutive days. Upon termination of stage 3, stage 2 becomes operative as directed by the city manager or his or her designee. 
(Code 1988, § 8-65; Ord. No. 1362, § 1, 8-13-2002; Ord. No. 1532, Exhibit A, § E, 5-24-2005) 
Sec. 26-86. - Notification. 
(a)  This plan has been presented to the public at a formal public meeting with a request for comments. 
(b)  Public notification of the initiation or termination of drought response stages shall be by means of publication in the Bryan-College Station Eagle and public service announcements on KBTX, channe1 3. Additional methods of public notification may include signs posted in public places, utility bill inserts, and other means to be determined by the city manager or his or her designee. 
(c)  When mandatory restrictions are enacted with the initiation of stage 2 and/or stage 3, the executive director of TCEQ will be notified, at a minimum via telephone, within five business days. 
(d)  Public education of the plan will be provided periodically to update the public with information about the conditions under which each stage of the plan is to be initiated or terminated as well as the drought measures to be implemented in each stage. This information may be provided through utility bill inserts, public events, or other means as to be determined by the city manager or his or her designee. 
(Code 1988, § 8-66; Ord. No. 1362, § 1, 8-13-2002; Ord. No. 1532, Exhibit A, § F, 5-24-2005)

The phrases should be spaced fifteen feet (15') apart continuously. Ex: FIRE LANE (15 foot space) NO PARKING (15 foot space) TOW AWAY ZONE (15 foot space) FIRE LANE....

State Law reference- Responsibility to adopt flood ordinances, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.3145. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 46-1-46-10. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD PROTECTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 46-11. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Texas has in V.T.C.A. Water Code § 16.315, et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-12. - Findings of fact. 
    As a part of these provisions, the city finds that: 
(1)  The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are the result of the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of special flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(3)  The city, in an attempt to require the development of property in such a way as to not adversely impact on potential stormwater and flooding has caused this chapter to be enacted. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-13. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Maximize the cost effectiveness of expenditures of public money for flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base for the city by providing for the organized development of all areas in such a manner as to minimize future areas of flooding; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential property owners are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-14. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    To accomplish its purpose, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span; 
(3)  Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, their protective barriers and stream channels, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Prevents the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards; and 
(5)  Controls development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage such as grading, dredging, filling, and excavation. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-15. - Definitions.

    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood average depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by sheet flow or ponding. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The term "special flood hazard area", for purposes of these regulations, is synonymous with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".

ICC coverage is provided for in every standard NFIP flood insurance policy, and will help pay for the cost to floodproof, relocate, elevate, or demolish the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis, and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term does not include "recreational vehicle" unless it is placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days.

It includes substantial improvement. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or any gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, addition, or other improvement of a structure, during the life of the structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the zoning board of adjustment from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner that would be otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(2)  Review, approve or deny all applications for floodplain development permits required by this article; 
(3)  Review permits for proposed development to assure that the developer has obtained all necessary permits from those federal, state or local government agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required. Developer will submit documentation of those necessary permits to the city and such documentation is to be maintained on file with the floodplain development permit; 
(4)  Review reports, studies, plans and specifications for compliance with the requirements of this article; 
(5)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor of all new construction and substantial improvements, by requiring an elevation certificate sealed by a licensed professional; 
(6)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved nonresidential structures in A-Zones have been floodproofed by requiring an elevation certificate sealed by a licensed professional; 
(7)  Provide interpretation as needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard and regulatory floodway (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided for in this chapter; 
(8)  Notify in riverine situations adjacent communities and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished;

(a)  A showing of good and sufficient cause, 
(b)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
(c)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Variances may only be granted for the minimum necessary deviation to accomplish the purposes of this article. 
(5)  Variances will not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures if the proposed repair or rehabilitation would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(7)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use if: 
(a)  The criteria of paragraphs (3) through (5) of this section are met, and 
(b)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-32. - Factors to consider in granting a variance request.

(1)  Floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, so that a determination may be made whether or not such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas. 
(2)  The developer of new construction, substantial improvements, and other development proposals must assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or by wide-area agencies. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements must be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(4)  All new construction and substantial improvements must be constructed with materials and utility elements resistant to flood damage. 
(5)  All new construction or substantial improvements must be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(6)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities, including duct work, must be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(7)  Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must be assured that they will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that: 
a.  All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area, 
b.  All public and private utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and 
c.  Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(8)  New and replacement water supply systems must be designed to prevent infiltration of flood waters into the systems. 
(9)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems must be designed to prevent infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems must be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-42. - Standards for approximate A-Zones. 
    On land located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-22, where streams exist for which no base flood elevation data or regulatory floodway has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Compliance with the standards listed in section 46-41. 
(2)  Base flood elevation data must be submitted to the floodplain administrator for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, if not otherwise required by this article. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator will obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including data developed pursuant to subsection (2). When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the new construction, substantial improvements, or other development must meet the elevation and nonelevation requirements of sections 46-43 through 46-45. 
(4)  When the base flood elevation data is utilized, the floodplain administrator will: 
a.  Obtain from the developer in the form of an elevation certificate the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures, 
b.  Obtain, if the structure has been flood proofed in accordance with the requirements of section 46-43, the elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the structure has been flood proofed, and

(8)  When the base flood elevation data is not available from any source, the lowest floor of the new construction and substantial improvements must be elevated to three feet above the highest adjacent grade, (or two [feet] above the highest crown of the adjacent roadway). 
(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is in compliance with the provisions of this article must meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this article; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article may be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended, or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-43. - Specific standards for noncoastal high hazard areas. 
    In all noncoastal areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 46-22, but no regulatory floodways have been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Compliance with the standards in section 46-42. 
(2)  Residential structures. 
a.  All new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH (including substantially damaged manufactured homes by flood) must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within AO Zone must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(3)  Nonresidential structures. 
a.  All new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures within Zones A1-30, AE and AH may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood elevation plus one foot the structure is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect must certify that the provisions of this subsection are satisfied. The FEMA floodproofing certificate must be prepared and submitted to the floodplain administrator along with the corresponding operational and maintenance plans. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within Zone AO must: 
i.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
ii.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood proofed to that level to meet the floodproofing standard specified in subsection (3)a. of this section. 
(4)  Elevated structures. For all new construction or substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor elevation may be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. These enclosed areas must be designed and constructed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a professional engineer or architect, to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding must be provided, 
ii.  The bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above grade, and 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they provide the required net area of the openings and permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area must be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator), and 
c.  The interior portion of the enclosed areas may not be partitioned, temperature-controlled, or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  Provisions for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, must be elevated on a permanent foundation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist foundation collapse and lateral movement so that: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to 2.0 feet above the base flood elevation, and 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above the grade and be securely anchored to an adequate foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement as certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
b.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE must either: 
i.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
ii.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
iii.  Meet the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes in subsection 5a. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
c.  Require until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development including fill shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
d.  Within Zones AH and AO on the FIRM, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-44. - Standards for floodways. 
    On land located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-22, are designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles and have significant erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Compliance with standards in section 46-43. 
(2)  Prohibition on encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments with the regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(Ord. No. 1887, § 1, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 46-45. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA, preferably outside the 0.2 percent annual chance floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities may be permissible within the SFHA if feasible alternative sites are unavailable. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated 3.0 feet above the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible.

Sec. 46-110. - Definitions 
    In this article: 
    Administrator shall mean the public works director of the City of Bryan or designee. 
    Best management practices (BMP) shall mean schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to stormwater receiving waters, or municipal separate storm system. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. 
    City shall mean the City of Bryan. 
    City manager shall mean city manager of the City of Bryan or designee. 
    Commercial pertains to any business, trade, industry, or other activity engaged in for profit activities. 
    Common plan of development means a construction activity that is completed in separate stages, separate phases, or in combination with other construction activities. A common plan of development (also known as a "common plan of development or sale") is identified by the documentation for the construction project that identifies the scope of the project, and may include plats, blueprints, marketing plans, contracts, building permits, a public notice or hearing, zoning requests, or other similar documentation and activities. A common plan of development does not necessarily include all construction projects within the jurisdiction of a public entity (e.g., a city or university). Construction of roads or buildings in different parts of the jurisdiction would be considered separate "common plans," with only the interconnected parts of a project being considered part of a "common plan" (e.g., a building and its associated parking lot and driveways, airport runway and associated taxiways, a building complex, etc.). Where discrete construction projects occur within a larger common plan of development or sale but are located one-quarter mile or more apart, and the area between the projects is not being disturbed, each individual project can be treated as a separate plan of development or sale, provided that any interconnecting road, pipeline or utility project that is part of the same "common plan" is not included in the area to be disturbed. 
    Construction or construction activity shall mean soil disturbance activities, including clearing, grading, and excavating; and does not include routine maintenance that is performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of the site (e.g., the routine grading of existing dirt roads, asphalt overlays of existing roads, the routine clearing of existing right-of-ways, and similar maintenance activities).

c.  Stabilized construction entrances shall be designed to reduce the amount of soil tracked off the construction site by vehicles leaving the site. A stabilized construction entrance should be utilized to control tracking of material from the site. The responsible party shall ensure that vehicles entering and leaving the construction site use the stabilized construction entrance. The owner or operator of a vehicle entering or leaving a construction site may not track soil off the construction site. 
d.  Vegetative buffer strips, of appropriate size, should be maintained, where necessary and practical, to aid in reducing the velocity of stormwater and in trapping sediments in the stormwater leaving the site. A vegetative buffer will usually suffice as a structural control until final stabilization is accomplished. 
e.  Inlet protection barriers must be installed around all inlets to the storm sewer system and remain in place until the area surrounding the inlet is paved or stabilized sufficiently to prevent silt laden runoff from entering the storm sewer system. 
(2)  Waste controls. Waste disposal must be accompanied in a manner so that no solid wastes, including building materials, hazardous substances, oil, or packaging leave the site, except for disposal at an appropriate, approved solid waste management facility, in conformance with the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. To the extent practicable, no solid waste, including building materials, hazardous substances, or oil may be allowed to enter the city MS4, city streets, or waters of the United States. Building materials include, but are not limited to, uncovered stockpiles of soil, sand, dry cement, lumber, bricks, packaging or other products used in construction. The general contractor and/or builder, to whom the development permit and/or building permit is issued, is responsible for the conduct of all subcontractors with regards to disposal of wastes generated by the construction activities at the site. 
(3)  Dust control. Reasonable measures shall be taken to control dust, particulate matter, and windblown debris. 
(4)  Hazardous material storage . Chemicals, paints, solvents, fertilizers, and other toxic materials must be stored in waterproof containers. Except during applications, the contents must be kept in trucks or in storage facilities. Runoff containing such materials shall be collected, removed from the site, and disposed of at an approved solid waste or chemical disposal facility. 
(5)  Concrete trucks. The responsible party may not allow the owner or operator of a concrete truck to wash out or discharge surplus concrete or drum wash water at a construction site, unless the surplus concrete or drum wash water in concrete trucks is discharged at a facility on the construction site that will retain all concrete wash waters or leachates, including any wash waters or leachates mixed with stormwater. Concrete wash waters and leachates may not be allowed to enter the MS4, city streets, adjacent properties, the waters of the United States, or ground waters. 
(c)  Final pollution control measures (post construction ). These measures, specific to the type of site, provide final stabilization of the construction sites: 
(1)  All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been employed. 
(2)  For construction activities on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g. pipelines across crop or range land), final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its pre-construction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface water and areas which are not being returned to their pre-construction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization conditions of condition (c)(1) above. 
(3)  Acceptance of improvements by the city can occur before the final stabilization coverage requirement is met, if the developer agrees to maintain the stabilization until coverage is achieved and all other permanent measures are complete (i.e. performance bond). 
(4)  Once final stabilization has been achieved, the responsible party shall notify the administrator, or designated representative that final stabilization has been achieved. 
(5)  Erosion control structures must be provided where necessary to control erosive velocities in unlined channels or swales leaving the site. 
(6)  Sediment traps must be provided on the site, as necessary, to control sedimentation from concentrated stormwater discharges into an environmentally sensitive area. Individual assessments must be made on a site-specific basis. However, a rock rubble low berm must be installed around an outfall that discharges directly into an environmentally sensitive area, unless this requirement is waived by the administrator because the responsible party has installed another type of sediment trap that provides equal or better protection. 
(d)  Scheduling of control measures . pollution control measures must be implemented in a sequence that will provide maximum stormwater pollution control based on the following principles: 
(1)  Down slope and side slopes perimeter controls must be installed before land disturbing activity occurs. 
(2)  The responsible party shall not disturb the site until the responsible party is ready for construction to proceed. 
(3)  Efforts to provide cover or stabilize disturbed areas must occur as soon as possible. 
(4)  Temporary perimeter controls may not be removed until all upstream areas are permanently stabilized. 
(e)  Inspection of pollution control measures. The responsible party shall inspect all pollution control measures every 14 days and within 24 hours following a rainfall of 0.5 inches or greater, at the site. The inspection reports are to be considered part of the operator's SWP3, and as such, are subject to the same record retention schedule and availability requirements of the SWP3. The inspection reports, as well as, the entire SWP3 shall be made available for inspection by a representative of the city, during normal business hours. 
(f)  Maintenance of pollution control measures. 
(1)  The responsible party shall maintain and ensure adequate performance of the temporary pollution control measures until permanent pollution control measures are in place. 
(2)  Whenever the temporary or permanent pollution control measures do not keep soil, sediment, and debris on the construction site, such as excessive tracking of dirt offsite by vehicles and runoff of sediments from the site over sidewalks and into the streets and gutters, etc., the responsible party shall remove the soil, sediment, and debris from streets, sidewalks, inlets, or other areas including private property impacted such as determined by the administrator, return the soil and sediment to the areas to be stabilized, and properly dispose of the debris. 
(3)  The responsible party is responsible for the maintenance of any permanent pollution control measures located on the site, unless the owner has dedicated the permanent pollution control measure to the city and has provided the city with any easements necessary to allow access to the permanent pollution control measure and to conduct any required maintenance activities.

Sec. 46-127. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial and construction activities. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of the inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a TPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and to the performance of any additional duties as defined by the state and federal law. 
(3)  The administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in their opinion to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The administrator has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  If the administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the administrator is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the administrator may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
( Ord. No. 2133, § 1 , 1-12-2016) 
Sec. 46-128. - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for an emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting, or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater or the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mail[ed] to the administrator within three business days of the phone notification. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial facility, the owner or operator of such facility shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its reoccurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

Sec. 62-296. - Access standards. 
(a)  General principles. 
(1)  Nonresidential parking areas shall be designed to not allow backing of vehicles into a public street. 
(2)  Access facilities shall be located and designed with respect to both the public street and the on-site circulation to provide maximum safety and to minimize interference with street traffic. To ensure this, the site development review committee may require a traffic study be performed. 
(3)  The property owner shall do all work and pay all costs in connection with the construction of access driveways and their appurtenances on the right-of-way. 
(4)  Temporary or permanent nonpublic all-weather drive surfaces will be required at the beginning of construction for emergency access or turnaround for emergency vehicles. The minimum standards for this surface shall consist of four inches of limestone base with a one-course seal coat in accordance with the city standards and specifications. 
(5)  Driveway entrances must be able to accommodate all vehicle types having occasion to enter the site, including delivery vehicles. 
(6)  Access to TxDOT facilities shall also comply with all TxDOT standards. 
(7)  No single-family dwelling, townhouse, or duplex unit may take direct access to arterial streets or collector streets if the property can be accessed by a local street. If it can only be accessed by an arterial or collector street, then adequate maneuvering space must be provided, as vehicles will not be allowed to back directly into these streets. 
(8)  Access from a nonresidential development to a local street shall be discouraged when the primary use of the local street is access to and from residences. 
(b)  Driveway design. All connections shall meet the following standards, as noted on the drawing below for clarification: 
(1)  Adjacent left, adjacent right, and opposite right corner clearance and commercial driveway spacing is determined by the functional classification of the street as follows (where raised medians are present, the spacing can be reduced by 20 percent): 
a.  Major arterials, 275 feet. 
b.  Minor arterials, 230 feet. 
c.  Collectors, 185 feet. 
d.  Locals, 150 feet. 
(2)  Opposite left corner clearance and commercial driveway spacing is determined by the functional classification of the street as follows (where raised medians are present, the spacing can be reduced by 20 percent): 
a.  Major arterials, 125 feet. 
b.  Minor arterials, 125 feet. 
c.  Collectors, 90 feet. 
d.  Locals, 75 feet. 
(3)  Single-family residence, duplex, and townhouse driveway spacing are exempt from the functional classification, and shall maintain 30 feet of corner clearance. 

(4)  In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient thoroughfare frontage to maintain the desirable spacing, the landowner have one of three options: 
a.  In cases where a property owner desires multiple access points that do not meet minimum spacing requirements, or when the property owner requests access to a street other than the one approved by the site development review committee, they may seek a variance from the planning and zoning commission for minimum spacing, number, and/or location. Staff shall include in its report a recommendation from the site development review committee. 
b.  The adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway. Common driveways shall meet the standards set forth herein. Approval shall be conditional upon submittal of a perpetual joint use agreement which complies with the requirements set forth in this article. 
c.  In cases where a property cannot meet the desirable spacing and currently has no improved access to the site, the city will not deny the property owner an access point. However, the access must be located in such a place to minimize safety concerns. 
(5)  Specifications for construction of access aprons shall be equal to or exceed the specifications for the existing street and be in accordance with the rules, regulations and standards for subdivision construction in the city. 
(6)  Driveways shall be designed to drain so that street drainage is contained within the street, storm sewer or appropriate drainageway in order to ensure protection to the private property. Typically, this is achieved by constructing the drive such that the elevation of the driveway at the property line is at least as high as the top of curb. 
(c)  Minimum curb return radius standards. Minimum curb return radius standards (measured face-to-face) in accordance with AASHTO design standards: 
(1)  Single-family residential, two feet.

(e)  End islands. An end island shall be required at the end of each parking row. The island shall have raised curbing not less than six inches in height and encompass an area of not less than 180 square feet for single parking row end islands or 360 square feet for double single row end islands. 
(f)  Dividers. Bay dividers shall be provided in order to prevent uncontrolled movement across parking areas, to separate the parking area from the adjacent property, and to increase the safety of individuals using the lot. Dividers shall be provided on every other parking row and conform to one of the following standards: 
(1)  Wheel stops shall be made of concrete and/or approved materials not less than six inches in height and six feet in length and shall be anchored and placed in the center of each parking stall two and one-half feet behind the front of the parking space. 
(2)  Raised dividers shall have raised six-inch curbing and be a minimum of five feet in width measured from face of curb to face of curb and tie in with the end island. 
(3)  Raised dividers that are landscaped shall have raised six-inch curbing and be a minimum of seven feet in width and tie in to the end island. 
(g)  Traffic control signs. All traffic control signs required for the site shall meet the standards established in the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(h)  Off-site parking. All parking spaces required by this article shall be located on the same property as the structure they serve, except where an enlargement or change in use increases the required number of spaces. In such cases, off-site parking may be allowed and must conform to the following standards: 
(1)  The off-site parking area must be on adjacent property to the property served or within 100 feet of the structure they serve if not located on the property adjacent to the site. 
(2)  Access to off-site parking shall not interfere with the normal movement of traffic along adjacent arterials or collectors, as specified in the major thoroughfare plan, nor as to endanger pedestrians moving between the parking area and the structure served. Off-site parking is not allowed in any area that would require a pedestrian to cross an arterial street. 
(3)  To discourage the use of thoroughfares by circulating vehicles, provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels shall be provided through coordinated or joint parking systems. 
(4)  The off-site parking area shall remain in use as long as the parking requirement exists or until such time that adequate on-site parking is provided. In any case where required parking spaces are not located on the same property with the activity or establishment, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form by the city attorney filed with the county and submitted with the application for site plan approval. 
(i)  Amount of parking required. 
(1)  Rules for computing the parking requirement. 
a.  Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next largest whole number. 
b.  The parking space required for a use not specifically mentioned herein shall be the same as required for a similar use. 
c.  A parking analysis shall be required for each development and shall be a part of the site plan submittal. It shall include the number of employees, number of parking spaces provided, number of spaces required with proper calculations, square footage of each structure and the use of each structure. When necessary, an additional traffic impact analysis may be required to determine the impacts of a development on the off-site public street system.

(Ord. No. 2209 , § 2(Exh. A), 5-10-2017) 
Sec. 62-662. - General standards and design requirements. 
    The site development requirements for WTFs follow the normal standards for any other type of development according to the city's local code and ordinances. However, some additional standards apply to these sites as follows: 
(1)  Height limitations. 
a.  All WTFs are subject to the normal zoning height restrictions for each zoning district where permitted by right. In any zoning district where a tower is a conditional use, the allowable height is determined through the review of the visual impact analysis, with the maximum permitted heights for WTFs being determined by the use categories. 
b.  In no case shall a proposed transmission tower exceed 200 feet within the city limits, except where a height variance is granted by the zoning board of adjustment to allow a tower or antenna that demonstrates a hardship that can only be remedied by locating on a proposed site within the city limits. 
(2)  Tower siting along major thoroughfares and gateways. Refer to the WTF siting matrix in zoning ordinance section 130-35(b)(2). 
(3)  Siting in overlay districts. Refer to the WTF siting matrix in zoning ordinance section 130-35(b)(2). 
(4)  Separation between towers. 
a.  The city desires to protect its natural beauty and skyline by limiting the number of towers per square mile. Densities for towers are calculated using the following: 
1.  For minor facilities, towers shall be separated by a minimum of the height of the tower multiplied by 50. 
2.  For intermediate facilities, towers shall be separated by a minimum of the height of the tower multiplied by 45. 
3.  For major facilities, towers shall be separated by a minimum of the height of the tower multiplied by 25. 
(5)  Additional setbacks and separation requirements. WTFs are required to comply with the standard setbacks for each zoning district and shall comply with the landscaping and screening requirement section 62-662(4). Some additional setbacks or separation shall be required depending on the type of WTF and the potential location of that facility. Refer to the WTF siting matrix in zoning ordinance section 130-35(b)(2). However the following standards are applicable to all telecommunications facilities: 
a.  To protect citizens in their homes, at a minimum, towers shall be placed the tower height distance or 100 feet whichever is greater away from any residential structure or residential zone boundary. 
b.  To protect the architectural beauty and significance of certain overlay districts, towers shall be placed at or behind the imaginary front line of the most major (largest gfa) structure on site. 
(6)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. 
(7)  Special aesthetic and lighting standards. 
a.  New transmission towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or be painted in accordance with any applicable standards of the FAA. 
b.  The design of the related buildings and equipment shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the facility to the natural setting and built environment. 
c.  If an antenna is installed on a support structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusiveness as possible. 
d.  WTFs shall not be artificially lighted with the exception of motion detectors as security lighting, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding properties. 
(8)  Landscaping and screening requirements. The following minimum requirements shall govern the landscaping and screening for a tower or any parabolic antenna larger than two meters. 
a.  Tower compounds shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the base of the WTF site from view of public right-of-way. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. A screening fence may be used in part to screen a WTF, but must be in addition to the required landscaping. 
b.  Certain parabolic dishes attached to the ground shall be screened from public right-of-way by a combination of siting at or behind the imaginary front line of the most major structure on site (largest in gross floor area) and landscaping a four feet wide strip between the dish and right-of-way. Refer to the WTF siting matrix in zoning ordinance section 130-35(b)(2). 
c.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, where towers are sited on large, wooded parcels, natural growth around the site perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
d.  It is the responsibility of the WTF owner to maintain any required landscaping. 
(9)  Parking and access. All proposed towers shall provide a point of access from right-of-way, which is in conformance with city driveway standards. No off-street parking is required, unless off-street parking is required as a condition of a conditional use permit. 
(Ord. No. 2209 , § 2(Exh. A), 5-10-2017; Ord. No. 2228 , § 4, 8-22-2017) 
Sec. 62-663. - Use of consultant. 
    The city reserves the right to employ the services of a telecommunications consultant and/or expert to review any application or information supplement to an application when the director of development services, in his or her discretion, determines that the information provided by the applicant is beyond the technical capacity of the city staff to review. The personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analysis tools, including geographically based computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of personal wireless services and low power mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In certain instances, there may be a need for expert review by a third party of the technical data submitted by the applicant. 
    The selection of the third party consultant shall be at the sole discretion of the city, with a provision for the applicant and interested parties to review its qualifications. The applicant shall pay the cost for any consultant fees, through a deposit, estimated by the city, but not to exceed $5,000.00 per WTF, which is to be paid within ten days of the city's written request. Such a review should address the accuracy and completeness of the technical data, whether the analysis techniques and methodologies are legitimate, the validity of the conclusions and any specific technical issues outlined by the city council, planning commission, city staff, or interested parties. 
    Based on the results of the third party consultant's review, the director of development services may determine the application to be incomplete and may require supplemental submissions. The expert review of the technical submission shall address the following: 
(1)  The accuracy and completeness of submissions; 
(2)  The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies; 
(3)  The validity of conclusions reached; 
(4)  Any specific technical issues designated by the city; and 
(5)  Recommendations of the consultant. 
The report and recommendations of the consultant will be considered by the city council, planning and zoning commission and the zoning board of adjustment, as is applicable, when considering whether to grant a conditional use permit, a rezoning, an exception or variance for any wireless communications facility, and by the director of development services for compliance with all applicable ordinances.

(2)  Submit a bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other appropriate surety acceptable to the city in the amount of the estimate as approved by the director of development services which shall: 1. Secure the cost of removing the facility and restoring the site to its original condition to the extent reasonably possible. 2. Include a mechanism for a cost of living adjustment after 10 and 15 years. 
(3)  The applicant will ensure the bond shall remain in effect until the building official has inspected the site and verified that the wireless telecommunications facility and equipment has been removed and the site restored. At which time the director of development services shall promptly release the bond. 
(Ord. No. 2209 , § 2(Exh. A), 5-10-2017) 
Sec. 62-665. - Removal, maintenance and safety. 
(a)  The applicant shall maintain the wireless telecommunications facility in good condition. Such maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, painting, structural integrity of the foundation and tower or base station structure and security barrier (if applicable), and maintenance of the buffer areas and landscaping if present. The project owner shall be responsible for the cost of maintaining the wireless telecommunications facility and access road if present, unless accepted as a public way, and the cost of repairing any damage occurring as a result of operation and construction. 
(b)  Any wireless telecommunications facility that is found to be unsafe by the building official shall be repaired by the owner to meet federal, state, and local safety standards or disassembled and completely removed, including the concrete pad, within 60 days. 
(c)  Any wireless telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the system shall completely remove the wireless telecommunications facility within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city instructing the owner to remove the facility. If there are two or more users of a single wireless telecommunications facility then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease operations on the facility.

(Ord. No. 2110 , § 2, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 62-681. - Best practices. 
(a)  Projects should be compatible with the scale of adjacent and nearby actual and anticipated development and should provide a sensitive transition to more restrictive zoning districts. 
(b)  New buildings proposed in areas that have a well-defined and desirable character should be compatible with or complement the architectural character and siting pattern of nearby buildings as well as the spatial characteristics of the right-of-way. New buildings proposed in other areas should reinvigorate the area by introducing more desirable features. Features that can be used to integrate new buildings include fenestration patterns, building proportions, roof forms or building materials. 
(c)  Building design elements, details, and massing should create a well-proportioned and unified building form and exhibit an overall architectural concept. Buildings should exhibit form and features identifying the functions within the building with elements and details to achieve a good human scale. 
(d)  Building exteriors should be constructed of durable and maintainable materials that are attractive even when viewed up close. Materials that have texture, pattern, and lend themselves to a high quality of detailing are encouraged. Buildings should avoid large blank walls facing the street. 
(e)  Convenient, identifiable and attractive access to the building's entry should be provided. To ensure comfort and security, paths and entry areas should be sufficiently lighted and entry areas should be protected from the weather. Opportunities for creating lively, pedestrian-oriented open space should be considered, especially along the street edge. 
(f)  Site design should consider opportunities for enhancing personal safety and security, including providing adequate lighting and minimizing visual clutter. Buildings should avoid large blank walls lacking design features, but should preferably allow for visual connection between activities occurring on the interior and exterior of the building. 
(g)  Where possible, landscaping should reinforce the character of the development and abutting streetscape while enhancing the architecture of the building project. Possibilities include special pavements, trellises, screen walls, fountains, planters and site furniture. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 2, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 62-682. - Building frontages. 
(a)  Applicability. This section is applicable to any publicly visible building frontage of any commercial land use on any thoroughfare referenced in section 62-680(f). Building facades adjoining other buildings (attached to more than 50 percent of the sidewall) are exempt. 
(b)  Exterior colors. Please refer to division 3 for colors permitted on exterior facades of commercial structures. 
(c)  Fabric awnings. If used, fabric awnings must be composed of fabric that is guaranteed by the manufacturer to survive in good condition for no less than ten years from the date of installation. 
(d)  Shade and shelter. Bryan's climate requires shade and shelter amenities in order to accommodate and promote pedestrian activity, as well as protect pedestrians from inclement weather. Projects shall meet the following shade and shelter requirements: 

(1)  If provided, at least one ADA ramp alongside the building must be shaded to a minimum of two times the width (as determined by a ramp user) of the contiguous lineal ramp section closest to the building. If a rear ADA ramp is also provided as part of the building design, it shall also meet the requirements of this section. Such shade devices shall have a maximum canopy height of 15 feet. 
(2)  Principal building entrances shall be located under a shade device such as a building projection or recess in building face with a minimum depth of six feet and maximum canopy height of 20 feet. 
(e)  Glazing on building facades. Glazing provides interest for the passer-by, connects the building exterior and interior, puts eyes on the street, promotes reusability, and provides a human-scale element on building facades. 
(1)  Any façade that is built up to an interior mid-block property line is not required to have glazing on that façade, if no prohibitions and no contractual or legal impediments exist that would prevent a building being constructed on the adjacent property up to the wall of the façade ("zero lot line" structures). 
(2)  At least one-third of the total area of all glazing on ground-floor facades that face the principal street shall have a visible transmittance (VT) of 0.4 or higher. 
(3)  Walls that must be blank for security or other requirements shall be enhanced by the use of plant materials, artwork, canopies, special lighting, or a combination of façade articulation and material changes. Any such alternative plans must be approved by the design review board. Plans submitted for consideration must be sealed by a registered architect or landscape architect, as appropriate, and show reasonable evidence that the requirements set forth in these standards were used as a guide. Evidence of security requirements should be submitted as listed in state or federal law.

a.  Bond. A bond must be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in Texas acceptable to the city. The bond must be effective on or before the date the oil or gas well permit is issued and must remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The operator will be listed as principal and the instrument must run to the city, as obligee, and must be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the city. The original bond must be submitted to the city secretary with a copy provided to the oil and gas inspector. 
b.  Letter of credit. A letter of credit must be issued by a reliable bank or other financial institution, acceptable by the city, authorized to do business in Texas and must become effective on or before the date the permit is issued. The letter of credit must remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term. The city must be authorized to draw upon the letter of credit to recover any fines or penalties assessed under this article. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit must be submitted to the city secretary by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking or financial institution, with a copy provided to the oil and gas inspector. 
c.  The minimum amount of any security instrument must be $50,000.00 for any single well. 
d.  At any time, and with 15 days' written notice to the operator, the oil and gas inspector may deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, and the city may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well. 
e.  Whenever the oil and gas inspector finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this article, a written notice will be given to the operator. The notice will specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the oil and gas inspector to be reasonably necessary for the completion of the work. After receipt of the notice, the operator will, within the time specified in the notice, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, will pay the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work. The cure period will never be less than 30 days. The maximum cure period will not exceed 45 days. The city is authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover the amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of the money, the city will proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability will be incurred other than for the expenditure of the sum in hand. If the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
f.  When the well or wells covered by the irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations will be terminated and canceled. 
(c)  Insurance.

All well casings must be cut and removed to a depth of at least ten feet below the surface unless the surface owner submits a written agreement otherwise. The surface owner may not agree to a depth less than three feet. No structures may be built over an abandoned well. 
(2)  Blowout prevention. In all cases, blowout prevention equipment must be used on all wells being drilled, worked-over or in which tubing is being changed. Protection must be provided to prevent blowout during oil or gas operations as required by and in conformance with the requirements of the commission and the recommendations of the American Petroleum Institute. The operator must equip all drilling wells with adequate blowout preventors, flow lines and valves commensurate with the working pressures involved as required by the commission. 
(3)  Chemical and materials storage. All chemical or hazardous material must be stored in such a manner as to prevent, contain, and facilitate rapid remediation and cleanup of any accidental spill, leak, or discharge of a hazardous material and must be approved by the inspector. Operator must have all material safety data sheets (MSDSs) for all hazardous materials on site. All applicable federal and state regulatory requirements for the proper labeling of containers must be followed. Appropriate pollution prevention actions are required and include chemical and materials raised from the ground (e.g., wooden pallets), bulk storage, instillations and maintenance of secondary containment systems, and protection from stormwater and weather elements. 
(4)  Closed-loop drilling fluid systems. Closed-loop drilling systems must be used instead of lined reserve pits. 
(5)  Compliance. Operator must comply at all times with all applicable federal, state and city requirements. 
(6)  Discharge. No person may place, deposit, discharge, or cause or permit to be placed, deposited or discharged, any oil, naptha, petroleum, asphalt, tar, hydrocarbon substances, or any other refuse including wastewater or brine from any oil or gas operation, or the contents of any container used in connection with any oil or gas operation in, into, or upon the drill site, any public right-of-way, alleys, streets, lots, storm drain, ditch or sewer, sanitary drain or any body of water or watercourse that may ultimately enter into waters of the city, state or United States. 
(7)  Drilling fluids. Low toxicity glycols, synthetic hydrocarbons, polymers, and esters must be substituted for conventional oil-based drilling fluids. 
(8)  Drilling fluid storage pit. No drilling fluid storage pits may be located within the city. 
(9)  Drill stem testing. All open hole formation or drill stem testing must be done during daylight hours. Drill stem tests may be conducted only if the well effluent during the test is produced through an adequate oil or gas separator to storage tanks and the effluent remaining in the drill pipe at the time the tool is closed is flushed to the surface by circulating drilling fluid down the annulus and up the drilling pipe. The material flushed must be secured and contained without release into the environment. 
(10)  Drip pans and other containment devices. Drip pans and other containment devices must be placed or installed underneath all tanks, containers, pumps, lubricating oil systems, engines, fuel and chemical storage tanks, system valves, connections, and any other areas or structures that could potentially leak, discharge, or spill hazardous liquids, semi-liquids, or solid waste materials, including hazardous waste inseparable by simple mechanical removal processes, and made up of primarily of natural material. 
(11)  Dust, vibrations, odors. All drilling, re-drilling, re-working and production operations must be conducted in such a manner as to minimize, so far as practicable, dust, vibration, or noxious odors, and must be in accordance with the best accepted practices incident to drilling, re-drilling, and re-working for the production of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon substances in urban areas. All equipment used must be so constructed and operated so that vibrations, dust, odor, or other harmful or annoying substances or effect will be minimized by the operations carried on at any drilling or production site or from anything incident thereto, to the injury or annoyance of persons living in the vicinity; nor may the site or structures thereon be permitted to become dilapidated, unsightly or unsafe. Proven technological improvements in industry standards of drilling, re-drilling, reworking and production in this area must be adopted as they become available if capable of reducing factors of dust, vibration and odor. 
(12)  Electric lines. All operations on the site shall be powered by underground electric lines when sufficient power is available within 800 feet of the pad site. When electric utility lines are located within 800 feet of the pad site and are determined to be sufficient for operations, the operator may use fuel powered generators only as a backup in the event of a power failure. When such electric utility lines are not located within 800 feet of the pad site the operator shall install electric lines to the site. Overhead lines are permitted up to 800 feet of the pad site. The remaining 800 feet must be located underground. 
(13)  Electric motors. Only electric prime movers or motors are permitted for the purpose of pumping wells. No electric power may be generated on location except for thermal electric generators.

(a)  A plan for landscaping and irrigation should be submitted with the oil and gas well permit application. Landscaping and irrigation is required along all sides of the well site with suitable screening done using a combination of trees and shrubs that compliment the natural character of the surrounding area. All landscaping must be installed within 45 days of the beginning of the pad site construction. 
    The landscape and irrigation plan must meet the following requirements: 
(1)  A minimum 20-foot landscape buffer outside the perimeter fencing; 
(2)  Trees should be a minimum three-inch caliper at the time of planting and shrubs should be a minimum of three feet in height at planting with the potential to grow to a mature height of at least five feet and, if necessary, must have an installed irrigation system that provides total water coverage to all plant materials. All vegetation must be planted and spaced to provide maximum screening, growth, and overall health.

(c)  Free from debris. The property on which a well site is located must at all times be kept free of debris, pools of water or other liquids, contaminated soil, weeds, brush, trash or other waste material. 
(d)  Painting. All production equipment must be painted and maintained at all times, including wellheads, pumping units, tanks, and buildings or structures. When requiring painting of the facilities, the oil and gas inspector will consider the deterioration of the quality of the material of which the facility or equipment is constructed, the degree of rust, and its appearance. Paint must be of a neutral color, compatible with surrounding uses. Neutral colors include sand, gray and unobtrusive shades of green, blue and brown, or other neutral colors approved by the oil and gas inspector. The color of all tanks, fixed equipment and painted surfaces, including fences, must be the same throughout the pad site. 
(e)  Blowouts. In the event of the loss of control of any well, the operator must immediately take all reasonable steps to regain control regardless of any other provision of this article and must notify the oil and gas inspector as soon as practicable. If the oil and gas inspector, in his or her opinion, believes that dangers to persons and property exists because of the loss of well control and that the operator is not taking or is unable to take all reasonable and necessary steps to regain control of the well, the oil and gas inspector may then employ any well control expert or experts or other contractors or suppliers of special services, or may incur any other expenses for labor and material which the oil and gas inspector deems necessary to regain control of the well. The city will then have a valid lien against the interest in the well of all working interest owners to secure payment of any expenditure made by the city pursuant to the action of the oil and gas inspector in gaining control of the well.

The pad shall be surrounded on three sides with a screen constructed from city approved material. The pad and screening are to be constructed at the business owner's expense. 
(3)  The container location for a metal, side load dumpster shall have a concrete pad ten feet wide and six feet deep, constructed with a minimum six inch depth to support the weight of the collection vehicle. The pad shall be surrounded on three sides by a decorative screen that is a minimum of five feet high, ten feet wide and six feet deep, when and where required.

(6)  The owner or occupant of the premises for whom a container has been furnished shall be responsible for keeping the area around the container clean and clear of all garbage and trash. 
(7)  If an exception is made to the size of the commercial container and a city issued residential container is used, no screening fence or pad is required. However, placement of a container for collection shall be no sooner than 12 hours before the scheduled collection day. Serviced containers shall be removed within 12 hours of collection from the designated pickup point and returned to a location adjacent to the place of business.

For any such expenditure and interest and reasonable attorney's fees, suit may be instituted and recovery and foreclosure had by the city. 
(b)  Nothing herein shall inhibit the right of the city to make immediate repair of any condition considered to be of unusual and immediate danger to life or limb. In such instance, the director shall send an invoice for expenses incurred in the repair of such condition to the owner of the abutting property and within ten days the owner shall have the right to a hearing on the matter of the reasonableness of the action and cost of repair. The hearing procedures shall be established by separate policy of the city. Should the result of the hearing be that the director's position is upheld, the owner shall pay the reasonable expenses as determined by the director. In the event the owner fails or refuses to pay such expense within 30 days after notice of the reasonable charge by the director, and after any hearing on the matter of the reasonableness of the action and cost of repair, the city shall follow the procedure written above to perfect a lien on such property, which lien shall have the same character as written above.

(Code 1988, § 24-58; Ord. No. 1443, § II, 10-28-2003) 
Sec. 106-164. - Signs within public rights-of-way and on public property. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section in regulating signs is to preserve and protect the public health, welfare and safety. It is intended to facilitate movement and ensure safety in public areas and on public rights-of-way. It is also intended to enhance the physical appearance of the city, make the city a more enjoyable and pleasing community, and to create a more attractive economic and business climate. 
(b)  Findings. Therefore, the city council finds that it is in the public interest to enact restrictions on the placement or display of signs in the public right-of-way and on public property. Notwithstanding the above, in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter the city finds that it has a compelling and substantial interest in permitting certain signs in the public right-of-way, as follows: 
(1)  The city council finds that safety, traffic, or other public information signals, signs, banners or notices erected or maintained by a public officer or employee in the performance of a public duty, are necessary in order to ensure the safety of the public, to inform the public about the location of public buildings, parks, schools, streets and highways. 
(2)  The city finds that temporary emergency or safety pedestrian and vehicular warning signs are necessary to protect the public from temporary and unanticipated dangers and public emergencies. 
(3)  The city council finds the city's downtown zoning districts unique in that the buildings' faces are constructed on the property line immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way and nonprojecting wall signs are not readily visible to the pedestrian traffic. The city council finds that projecting signs would (i) contribute to the revitalization of the downtown by promoting pedestrian oriented businesses; (ii) provide information to pedestrians in the downtown, and (iii) permit businesses in the downtown zoning districts to orient signs visible to passersby in a manner similar to businesses in other commercial districts where buildings are not constructed on the property line. 
(4)  The city council finds that temporary signs in the public right-of-way are necessary and desirable for street closing events, and should be permitted in the public rights-of-way as part of the street closing event permit at the location of the permitted event for the duration of the permit. 
(5)  The city finds that in order to promote freedom of expression, handheld signs, as defined in this chapter, should be permitted in the unimproved portions of the right-of-way and on sidewalks by persons lawfully present. 
(6)  The city finds that in order to promote the use of its public buildings and other publicly owned facilities, that lessees and licensed users of such public property be allowed to erect temporary signs, provided that those signs: 
a.  Comply with all other requirements of chapter 98, applicable to the same type of sign located in the same zoning district; 
b.  Do not deface, damage or destroy public property; and 
c.  Are maintained only during the duration of the license or lease. 
(7)  The city council finds a need in some planned residential subdivision developments, for wayfinding signs to provide direction to the subdivision development's amenities and facilities, utilized by the public, and finds such signs may aid traffic safety and should be allowed in the public rights-of-way by special use license to be renewed annually, provided that these signs comply with section 106-165. 
(Code 1988, § 24-59; Ord. No. 1443, § II, 10-28-2003; Ord. No. 1545, § 2, 8-9-2005; Ord. No. 2006, § 3, 7-23-2013)

(3)  One flag attached to a single freestanding pole, may be placed in the unimproved portion of the public right-of-way for every ten linear feet of frontage, if placed by the owner of the property abutting the public right-of-way or with the consent of said owner; 
(4)  Temporary signs permitted as part of a street closing event at the location of the permitted event for the duration of the permit, if all applicable liability insurance requirements set forth in section 15-191 of the Bryan City Code are satisfied; and the signs do not interfere with, or pose a danger to, vehicular or pedestrian traffic; do not threaten, damage or deface private property; and are not affixed to any tree, utility pole or public structure. 
(5)  Projecting signs, as defined in this article, shall be allowed within the DT-N, Downtown North, DT-S, Downtown South, and DT-C, Downtown Civic Zoning Districts and in all other zoning districts where attached to a legally nonconforming building, lawfully constructed on the property line immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way, and provided the projecting sign satisfies all of the requirements of section 62-251. Projecting signs within a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way must also obtain permission from that authority. 
(6)  Subdivision development wayfinding signs, as defined in this article, shall be allowed, provided the signs: 
a.  Are separately mounted beyond the clear zone and do not interfere with, obstruct, or divert roadway user's attention from official traffic control devices.

(d)  The following signs are allowed on public property: 
(1)  Government signs; 
(2)  Lessees or licensed user of public owned building and property leased or licensed from the city for business purposes shall be allowed to erect temporary signs in compliance with all other provisions of this Code, provided that those signs do not deface, damage or destroy such public property, and are maintained only during the duration of the license or lease. 
(e)  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the display of handheld signs, as that term is defined in this chapter, when carried by persons lawfully present on the unimproved portions of the public rights-of-way, public property, and on sidewalks. 
(Code 1988, § 24-60; Ord. No. 1443, § II, 10-28-2003; Ord. No. 1511, § 2, 1-11-2005; Ord. No. 1545, § 3, 8-9-2005; Ord. No. 2006, § 4, 7-23-2013) 
Sec. 106-166. - Obstruction and interference. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no sign shall be posted, displayed or carried at a location or in such a manner so as to obstruct or interfere with, or pose the threat of obstruction or interfering with, vehicular or pedestrian travel or pose a danger to any person. 
(Code 1988, § 24-61; Ord. No. 1443, § II, 10-28-2003) 
Sec. 106-167. - Determination of noncommercial messages. 
(a)  Findings. The city council finds that it may be necessary in the enforcement of section 106-165(b)(3), to determine whether the message displayed upon a flag is a commercial message or a noncommercial message. 
(b)  Hearing. If a person receives a notice of violation or is cited for maintaining an illegal commercial flag in the public right-of-way, and the person notifies the city attorney in writing within ten calendar days of receiving the notice or citation that he or she believes the flag displays a noncommercial message and is, therefore, not in violation of this chapter, the city attorney shall postpone the prosecution of the case and shall have the matter placed on the agenda of the board of sign control and appeals within 25 calendar days. The board shall determine whether the flag conveys a commercial message. The board shall utilize the definitions contained in this chapter in making its determination. The board shall make a determination no later than the 46th calendar day after the notice of violation or citation was received by the person maintaining the flag. The failure of the board to make a determination within the time required shall result in a deemed finding by the board that the flag is noncommercial. 
(c)  Judicial review. If the board determines that the flag conveys a commercial message and is illegally placed in the public right-of-way, the person maintaining the sign may, within ten days of the board's decision, file a notice of nonacceptance of the decision with the city attorney. Within 20 business days after receiving the notice of nonacceptance, the city attorney may initiate suit in the district court for determination that the sign is commercial and for an injunction to prohibit display of the sign in violation of this chapter. The city shall bear the burden of showing that the sign is commercial. 
(Code 1988, § 24-62; Ord. No. 1443, § II, 10-28-2003) 
Sec. 106-168. - Sign removal and impoundment.

Any sign so held may be redeemed by the owner thereof upon the payment of a fee to the city through the custodian thereof, consisting of a total of $25.00 for hauling the same to storage plus $5.00 per day storage fee for each day the sign is stored. Such fee shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any fine imposed upon such owner for violation of this chapter.

    No plat shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission or city staff and no completed improvements shall be accepted by the city unless they: 
(1)  Conform to or exceed the following standards and specifications and all other applicable standards; or 
(2)  An exception is granted as per article VI. 
a.  Conformity with zoning. Parcels must be consistent with zoning standards. 
b.  Conformity with comprehensive plan. The subdivision shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the city and any parts, amendments, and/or supplements thereto. 
c.  Conformity with design and construction standards for streets, drainage, water and sanitary sewer construction. All construction of infrastructure improvements shall be in accordance with the city's design guideline manual, utility master plans, and engineering standards, details, and specifications. 
d.  Certain detailed standards and specifications not covered herein. In circumstances where public health and safety issues are identified, the city manager may direct the city staff to specify additional requirements for a requested subdivision that are not covered within this chapter. No such requirement shall conflict with this or any other ordinance of the city. 
e.  Reserve strips. There shall be no reserve strips of property that create unusable tracts, added properties, and/or other nonconformities. 
f.  Provision for future resubdivision. If a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and future subdivisions. 
(Code 1988, § 25-21; Ord. No. 1261, § 10, 11-28-2000; Ord. No. 1386, § 2, 2-11-2003) 
Sec. 110-58. - Special provisions for urban estate residential subdivisions. 
    Urban estate residential subdivisions consist of lots having a minimum area of one acre or greater that are intended for single-family residential use. Because of the larger lot size and lower population and traffic densities within these subdivisions, the use of rural street sections may be permissible in accordance with the design guideline manual. Other than the curbing, the streets shall be constructed to city standards as depicted in the design guideline manual. All of the other following standards of this article are applicable. 
(Code 1988, § 25-22; Ord. No. 1261, § 11, 11-28-2000; Ord. No. 1386, § 2, 2-11-2003) 
Sec. 110-59. - Standards for subdivision design. 
(a)  Public streets. 
(1)  Street layout. 
a.  Thoroughfare plan. Proposed streets must be in conformance with the city's thoroughfare plan. All arterial and collector street locations, alignments, right-of-way widths, pavement widths and cross sections shall be in accordance with the adopted plan and design guideline manual. 
b.  Consistency with existing streets. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of each proposed street shall be consistent with surrounding streets. Consideration shall be made for topographical conditions, public safety, convenience, and the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. 
c.  Residential streets. Internal local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic. 
d.  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets or half streets shall be prohibited except for short stub-outs for future roadway extensions. Short stub-out streets may require special end treatments for drainage concerns and street integrity. Temporary turnarounds are required unless street stub-outs are one lot deep. 
e.  Secondary access streets. Where a subdivision has frontage on an arterial street, the city may require a secondary access street to facilitate the sharing of curb cuts and/or to separate access to lots from through traffic. Refer to the city fire code for additional requirements on number of access points into a subdivision. 
f.  Projection of streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the developer shall design and construct abutting streets, short stub-outs or temporary turnarounds for the projection of streets at proper block intervals into such unsubdivided areas. 
(2)  Street design standards. 
a.  Street design. Street design shall be in accordance with the city's design guideline manual and engineering standards and specifications. 
b.  Curbs and gutters. The developer shall install curbs and gutters on all new streets except in urban estate subdivisions or when engineering services deems appropriate. 
c.  Curb cuts. Curb cuts must conform to the standards within the site development review ordinance. Restrictions to location, design, size, and/or number of curb cuts may be imposed by the SDRC on subdivisions when traffic safety concerns are identified. 
d.  Pavement standards. All streets of any type, both public and private, shall be paved in accordance with city construction details and specifications. The city engineer may require increased right-of-way or pavement widths if traffic impacts of the proposed development or conditions in the area merit such changes.

a.  Eight hundred feet in subdivisions with lot sizes less than one acre; 
b.  One thousand two hundred feet in subdivisions with lot sizes equal to or greater than one acre. 
(4)  Loop street lengths shall not exceed: 
a.  One thousand six hundred feet in subdivisions with lot sizes less than one acre; 
b.  Two thousand four hundred feet in subdivisions with lot sizes equal to or greater than one acre. 
(d)  Easements. 
(1)  Drainage easements. Drainage easements may be required where a watercourse, drainageway, underground drainage pipe, natural channel or stream traverses a subdivision. No construction, including fences, shall impede, constrict, or block the flow of water in any easement or natural watercourse. Such easement shall not be considered a part of the lot area for purposes of minimum lot size requirements of the zoning ordinance. No other utilities will be allowed within a drainage easement. 
(2)  Utility easements. Each subdivision shall establish those easements necessary for design, construction, and maintenance of public services that will serve and/or cross the subdivision. 
a.  The width for all water and sanitary sewer utilities shall be a minimum of 15 feet and may need to be wider depending on type and depth of utilities or the easement location. 
b.  Where any aerial electrical utilities will be installed, these utility easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width. Depending on services required and project design, easement width may be increased. 
c.  Where any public or private utility line is required by the developer to be adjusted in location or elevation, the developer shall cause such changes to be made with the approval of the appropriate city representatives and shall bear all costs of such changes. 
d.  Easements with multiple utilities may require additional width.

Driveways in such easements shall be constructed using the same standards as alleys. 
b.  Pedestrian access easements. Pedestrian easements may be required where deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission or staff to provide pedestrian circulation within the subdivision or access to schools, shopping centers, recreation, transportation, or other community facilities. Such easements shall be at least ten feet in width and include a minimum four-foot sidewalk. 
(5)  Maintenance easements. 
a.  Dedication of a maintenance easement shall be required on subdivision plats for properties intended for zero lot line/patio home development. The maintenance easement shall be a minimum of seven and one-half feet in width and extend along the entire length of the side (zero) lot line to which it is adjacent. 
b.  A note on the subdivision plat shall read: "Maintenance easements shown hereon shall be perpetual private access easements in favor of the lots on which a zero lot line/patio homes are planned at the boundaries to which these easements are adjacent" (see also section 62-167 of the land and site development ordinance). 
(e)  Lots.

(3)  The developer shall extend water distribution and wastewater collection lines from the nearest city approved point of connection to the furthest boundary line of the platted subdivision along the right-of-way line. This is required in order to provide a point of connection for adjacent properties not having access to such services. 
(4)  Fire hydrants shall be installed at intervals in accordance with the design guideline manual. In areas not served by the city, the developer must perform a fire flow test on the system with the city staff as witnesses to assure adequate fire protection is provided. 
(j)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed by the developer along both sides of all urban residential streets, arterials, collectors and cul-de-sac streets (not including around the bulb of cul-de-sac streets), except along existing streets without curbs and gutters. Sidewalks shall be constructed to city standards including handicap accessibility at corners and access drives. All sidewalks must terminate into streets or access drives with ambulatory ramps. New sidewalks shall be built to adjoin existing walks and taper to required width if necessary. 
(k)  Payment to special fund in lieu of sidewalk construction. A subdivider responsible for construction of a sidewalk under subsection (j) may, on approval of the city engineer, elect to meet that requirement in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of actual construction on the ground. Such payments shall be made by submitting a cashier's check after the time of final plat approval but prior to the time the plat is recorded with the county clerk's office, or prior to the issuance of a building permit if a subdivision plat is not required. 
The requirement shall be met by a fee in lieu of construction at a rate set at the current rate of construction per square foot or square yard of sidewalk built to adopted city standards at the time of application. Such rate shall be determined by the city surveying local construction bid prices, TxDOT bid prices and/or any other available bid price information. The bid price survey shall be conducted on an annual basis or more frequently, as determined by city staff. The bid price survey shall be conducted by the transportation services department manager or his/her designee. The results of the survey will be filed and made available for public access in the offices of the development services department. Based on the findings of the bid price survey the fee rate shall be established by agreement between the transportation services department manager and the city engineer. 
Fee payments made under this section may be used only for construction of a new sidewalk or repair and maintenance of an existing sidewalk located within the same city council single member district within which a majority of the land area of the development that required construction of a sidewalk under subsection (j) is located. 
(l)  Special fund created and right to refund. There is hereby established one special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of sidewalk construction under this section. These funds shall be established, maintained, and utilized by the city's transportation services department. 
The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of sidewalk construction under this section with reference to the individual plats or projects involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within ten years from the date received for development of a sidewalk as defined herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the subdivider or developer of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of the sum paid. The subdivider or developer must request entitlement within one year of entitlement to refund, or such right to a refund shall be waived. Refunds shall include any accrued interest minus one percent administrative costs. 
(m)  Gated subdivisions. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection (k) is to achieve orderly development of a gated subdivision, and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the city. 
(2)  General requirements. 
a.  Gating of a public roadway is prohibited. However, gates may be placed in order to enclose subdivisions restricting access to privately owned and maintained streets. Private streets for gated subdivisions shall be clearly labeled and defined on all master plans, preliminary plans, and final plats for the subdivision. All master plans and preliminary plans for gated subdivisions shall be considered for approval by the planning and zoning commission and city council. No gated subdivision shall be approved unless the city council further finds that the gated subdivision conforms with the comprehensive plan, major thoroughfare plan, utility master plans, engineering specifications, city ordinances, and does not adversely affect health, safety and general welfare. 
b.  The gate shall not block area-wide through routes or block access for roadways to serve future development. 
c.  Access shall be provided at all times for police, fire, city inspection, mail delivery, garbage pickup, utility, school buses, para transit, demand and response vehicles, and other health and safety related vehicles. Access must not require drivers to exit their vehicle. 
d.  A private street subdivision will not block an existing or proposed thoroughfare as shown on the city's most recent thoroughfare plan. A private street subdivision will not disrupt or cross an existing or proposed city public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail or park as shown on the city's most recent parks and trails master plan. In addition, public parkland dedicated as a requirement of the gated subdivision (as outlined in section 110-60) shall not be enclosed within the gated area. 
e.  The gate design and implementation shall be such that it does not pose a threat to public health, safety and welfare. 
f.  Water and sewer main lines located within a public utility easement shall be maintained by the city. 
(3)  Homeowner's association (HOA). 
a.  A homeowner's association shall be established with direct responsibility to, and controlled by, the property owners involved to provide for operation, repair and maintenance of all private streets and sidewalks, which are part of the gated subdivision. 
b.  The legal instrument establishing the homeowner's association shall be submitted with the application for final plat. 
c.  The city shall have practical access to the subdivision at any time with out liability when on official business. The city may remove obstructions including any gate and guard (house) upon noncompliance by the HOA of any terms of this chapter or if necessary for emergency vehicle access. In the event the city must remove obstructions to access the development, the HOA will be assessed all costs of removal. 
d.  Maintenance responsibilities of the HOA shall be reviewed by the city on an ongoing basis. In the event the city deems that repairs to private streets within a gated community are necessary to ensure safe access and passage for any health and safety related vehicles, the city will notify the HOA by letter of the needed repairs. Should the HOA fail to provide the satisfactory repairs deemed necessary in a time frame set by the city in the notification letter, then the city may make the necessary repairs and assess the HOA all costs borne by the city in repair of the private streets, and may deduct the costs from the street maintenance reserve fund, if any, held by the city. 
(4)  Geometric design guidelines and reserve maintenance fund. 
a.  All streets in the development shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the city design guidelines, technical specifications and details. Prior to approval of the final plat, private streets built to these standards shall require the payment by the developer of a street maintenance reserve fund in an amount equal to $78.30 per lineal foot of private street. A special fund shall be established by the city for the deposit of the development's street maintenance reserve fund. The street maintenance reserve fund shall be held by the city until the fund is exhausted or the streets become public, in which event the remainder of the fund shall be forfeited to the city. The city may release all or portions of the fund to the HOA upon submission to city of contractor invoices for maintenance and repair of the streets. 
b.  Developments may be exempted from the street maintenance reserve fund requirements outlined above, if streets are constructed of a higher standard, including a minimum eight-inch thick Portland cement reinforced concrete paving over a minimum six-inch thick stabilized subgrade. 
c.  The gate location shall not be placed on a public right-of-way or easement.

g.  Gated entryways to subdivisions shall provide adequate access for pedestrians and bicycles. 
h.  To prevent backing into a public street, gated entryways to subdivisions shall provide adequate turnaround areas for vehicles that are denied access. 
i.  The gated area shall provide a minimum unobstructed vertical clearance of 14 feet six inches from finished roadway surface over the entire width of the entry roadway. 
j.  Public safety elements and signing shall be included in the gate entryway design. 
(5)  Indemnity. The developer and the HOA hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to indemnify, defend and hold the city and city's officials, agents, employees and contractors harmless, from and against any loss, liability, demand, damage, judgment, suit, claim, deficiency, interests, fee, charge, cost or expense (including, without limitation, interest, court cost and penalties, attorney's fees and disbursement and amounts paid in settlement, or liabilities resulting from any change in federal, state or local law or regulation or interpretation hereof) of whatever nature, even when caused in whole or in part by the city's negligence or the joint or concurring negligence of the city and any other person or entity, which may result or to which the city and/or any of the city's officials, agents, employees, and contractors may sustain, suffer, incur or become subject to in connection with or arising in any way whatsoever out of the maintenance, repair, use, or occupation of the common facilities, or any other activity of whatever nature in connection therewith, or arising out of or by reason of any investigation, litigation, or other proceedings brought or threatened, arising out of or based upon the operation, management, maintenance, repair and use of the common facilities, or any other activity in the subdivision. 
(n)  Two subdivision identification signs. Two subdivision identification signs are permitted per neighborhood, subdivision, or development entrance not to exceed 60 square feet per sign in sign area if said entrance has a median. One entrance sign is permitted per neighborhood, subdivision, or development entrance, not to exceed 60 square feet in sign area if said entrance does not have a median. 
(Code 1988, § 25-23; Ord. No. 1261, § 12, 11-28-2000; Ord. No. 1386, § 2, 2-11-2003; Ord. No. 1428, § 5, 8-30-2003; Ord. No. 1811, § 2, 5-26-2009; Ord. No. 2152 , § 7, 7-12-2016; Ord. No. 2223 , § 4, 7-25-2017) 
Sec. 110-60. - Parkland dedication requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  This section is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of community parks as a function of subdivision development in the city. This section is enacted in accordance with the Home Rule powers of the city, granted under the Texas Constitution, and the statutes of the state, including, but not by way of limitation, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 212. It is hereby declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of community parks are necessary and in the public welfare, and that a good procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city, whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing residential property. 
(2)  Community parks typically serve an area with a radius of one mile, and most of these also serve as neighborhood parks. Access is generally vehicular. Typical functions include organized and spontaneous active sports as well as picnic/play areas. Facilities may include off-street parking, restrooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, backstops, open play areas for football or soccer, picnic/play areas and group pavilions. Each city council single-member district shall coincide with a park zone. The park zones may be reviewed for potential revision by the parks and recreation advisory board. Changes in the boundaries of park zones must be approved by the city council. The primary cost of parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of their proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to effect the purposes stated. 
(b)  Dedication of parkland required. 
(1)  All residential developments shall be required to provide for the parkland needs of future residents through the fee simple dedication of suitable land for park and recreational purposes. The area shall be shown on the preliminary and final plat and included in the dedication statement. 
(2)  To maintain the current level of park service, the subdivider shall dedicate to the city parkland as a part of final plat approval. The amount of land required shall be calculated at a rate of not less than one acre of parkland per 74 single-family dwelling units or 90 mulitple-family dwelling units. The following formulas shall be used to determine the amount of parkland to be dedicated (see methodology, Appendix 1): For 36 months after official adoption by the council of this parkland dedication ordinance, the amount of parkland to be dedicated shall be as follows: 
a.  Single-family: 1.0 acre per 74 dwelling units. 
b.  Multiple-family: 1.0 acre per 90 dwelling units. 
These figures will be reevaluated every three years and may be modified by resolution of the city council. 
(3)  In the event a plat is not required, this dedication shall be met prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(4)  Manufactured home communities shall be charged at the mulitple-family rate. 
(5)  Information must be provided identifying the total number of proposed residential dwelling units at the time that the subdivision plat is submitted for residential development. 
(6)  Land dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be of a size, character, and location consistent with the guidelines provided in the parks and recreation master plan. Any land to be dedicated as parkland shall meet the standards for dedication of parkland. The required dedication of this section may be met by a payment of a fee in lieu of land when permitted or required by other provisions of this section. 
(7)  The dedication required by this section shall be made by filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instruments unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceeds the figure upon which the original dedication was based, additional dedication shall be required and shall be made by the fee in lieu of land amount. If the actual number of completed dwelling units is less than the fee in lieu of land paid, and if the city has not committed to the use of such funds, a refund may be requested. The following items relate to the dedicated park property survey and are required to be submitted prior to, or at the time of, final plat approval: 
a.  Dedicated park property survey requirement. 
1.  Drawing. 
(i)  In ink or CAD document. 
(ii)  Sheet size 24 inches times x 36 inches. 
(iii)  Scale one inch = 30 feet or larger. 
(iv)  Index sheet if survey is more than one sheet. 
2.  Data. 
(i)  Closest benchmark, and/or beginning point, to site. 
(ii)  Provide topographic information on this site as called for by the City of Bryan Ordinance No. 616, section 8.B.2a. 
(iii)  Location, dimensions, and purpose of all easements. 
(iv)  Number to identify lot, size and block. 
(v)  Minimum setback lines on all lots within park boundary. The specific distance varies as to structure type. These details are identified in City of Bryan Ordinance No. 616. 
(vi)  Location and description of monuments. 
(vii)  Reference to recorded subdivision plats or adjoining public land by recorded name, date, and number. 
(viii)  Title, scale, north arrow, date of survey. 
(ix)  Written metes and bounds description. 
(x)  Name and right-of-way adjoining property. 
(xi)  Names, size and location of telephone, gas, water, and sanitary sewer lines in and adjoining the site. 
(xii)  Limits of floodway and flood hazard areas (100-year floodplain) as per adopted maps published by FEMA. 
3.  Titles and certificates. Certification of registered state public surveyor certifying to accuracy of survey. 
(8)  The dedication required by this chapter shall be made by filing of the final plat and also by general warranty deed, which shall be recorded after filing. The land so dedicated and deeded shall not be subject to any reservations of record (except for minerals), encumbrances of any kind, or easements which in the opinion of the city parks and recreation division manager will interfere with its use for recreational purposes. 
(c)  Money in lieu of land dedication. 
(1)  Subject to subsection (c)(3) of this section, a landowner responsible for dedication under this section may elect to meet the requirements of this section in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land. Such payments shall be made by submitting a cashiers check after the time of final plat approval but prior to the time the plat is filed with the county clerk's office, or prior to the issuance of a building permit where a plat is not required. 
(2)  The city may from time-to-time decide to purchase land for parks in or near actual or potential development. If the city does purchase parkland in a park zone, subsequent parkland dedications for that zone may be in cash, at the city's discretion. The basis for determining the fee in lieu of land is specified in subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(3)  The dedication requirement shall be met by a fee in lieu of land at a per-acre price set from time-to-time by resolution of the city council, sufficient to acquire land and to provide for adjacent streets and utilities for a community park to serve the park zone in which such development is located (see methodology, Appendix 1). Cash payments may be used only for acquisition and improvement of a community park located within the same zone as the development. Fees in lieu of land will be calculated as follows (see methodology, Appendix 1): For 36 months after official adoption by the council, the parkland dedication fees in lieu of land shall be as follows: 
a.  Single-family: $162.00 per dwelling unit 
b.  Multifamily: $133.00 per dwelling unit 
For a subdivider to pay a fee in lieu of land, the subdivider must first obtain final approval from the planning and zoning commission with the recommendation of the parks and recreation advisory board. The planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation advisory board will take into consideration recommendations from the SDRC and parks and recreation division as to whether it is best for a park to be placed in the development or accept a fee in lieu of land instead. 
(d)  Park development. In addition to the land dedication, there shall also be a fee set from time-to-time by resolution of the city council sufficient to provide for the development of the land for neighborhood park purposes. If the city manager or his designee provides written approval and the procedural and substantive requirements of this chapter are met, a developer may construct, or finance the construction of, park improvements in lieu of paying the park development fee. 
(1)  Park development fee. The development fees shall be paid into a fund and those fees shall be tied to the parkland dedication that the subdivider made (by land or fee in lieu of land). For 36 months after official adoption by the council, the parkland development fees shall be as follows: 
a.  Single-family: $358.00 per dwelling unit 
b.  Multifamily: $292.00 per dwelling unit 
(2)  Construction of improvements. A developer may request permission to construct improvements to a park in lieu of paying the park development fee, provided that the value of the improvements equals or exceeds the park development fee for that development. In addition to other submittals required by this chapter, the developer must provide 
a.  a park site plan, developed in cooperation with and approved by the city manager or his designee after consideration by the parks and recreation advisory board; 
b.  detailed plans and specifications for improvements which meet or exceed specifications required by the city manager or his designee; and 
c.  if the improvements are to be constructed on land that has already been dedicated to and/or is owned by the city, the developer must post payment and performance bonds for the full amount of the work, on a form acceptable to the city. 
If the city manager or his designee provides written approval of the site plan and the specifications, the developer may begin construction of the park improvements, subject to the same inspection and acceptance requirements as other public infrastructure improvements required under this chapter, except that the letter of acceptance must be from both the city engineer and the city manager or his designee. As a prerequisite to acceptance, the developer shall require from his or her contractors, material suppliers, and equipment suppliers, and shall themselves furnish to the city a written guarantee that all workmanship, equipment, and materials shall be free of defects for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. 
(e)  Special fund created and right to refund. 
(1)  There is hereby established one special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of land dedication and development fees under this section. These funds shall be established, maintained, and utilized by the community services department. 
(2)  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication and development fees under this section with reference to the individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within seven years from the date received for acquisition or development of a community park as defined herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the subdividers of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum. The subdividers of such property must request entitlement within one year of entitlement, or such right to a refund shall be waived. Refunds shall include any accrued interest minus one percent administrative costs. 
(f)  Standards for dedication of parkland. 
(1)  When an area of less than six acres is required to be dedicated, the city shall have the right to accept the dedication or refuse the same and require the payment of fees in lieu thereof. 
(2)  Any land dedicated to the city under this section must be suitable for park and recreation uses. Consideration will be given to land that is in the floodplain or may be considered "floodable" even though not in the federally regulated floodplain as long as due to its elevation, it is suitable for park improvements. 
a.  Community park sites shall be adjacent to residential areas in a manner that serve the greatest number of users. 
b.  Community park sites shall be located in a manner where, if at all possible, the first consideration is that users are not required to cross arterial roadways to access them. 
(3)  Community parks shall be easy to access and open to public view so as to benefit area development, enhance the visual character of the city, protect public safety and minimize conflict with adjacent land uses. The following guidelines shall be used in designing parks and adjacent development. 
a.  Where physically feasible, park sites shall be located adjacent to schools in order to encourage shared facilities and potential co-development of new sites. 
b.  A proposed subdivision adjacent to a park may not be designed to restrict reasonable access to the park from other area subdivisions. 
c.  Where a nonresidential use must directly abut a park, the use must be separated by a screening wall or fence and landscaping. Access points to the park may be allowed by the planning and zoning commission with the recommendation of the parks and recreation advisory board, if public benefit is established. 
d.  The dedicated parkland shall provide a maximum of exposure to public areas. A minimum of 200 feet of frontage on a dedicated public street is required. The frontage shall be continuous and front on a street with 70 feet or less of dedicated right-of-way. 
e.  If potable water and sewage connections will serve the subdivision, such connections shall be readily available at the park site, with water and waste water lines. Subdivisions which will utilize individual septic systems are not required to provide dedicated parkland with an individual septic system. 
f.  The condition of any area or part of an area to be dedicated as parkland which is altered during any phase of the development must be restored in accordance to terms specified by the community services director or his or her designee. The exact restoration requirements will be determined on a case specific basis according to the pre- and post-construction condition of the parkland to be dedicated. 
(g)  Review of the dedication requirements. The city shall review the fees set forth in this section every three years. The city shall take into account inflation as it affects land and park development costs as well as the city's recreation and open space plan. Fees will be set by resolution of the city council. 
(h)  Additional requirements. Unless provided otherwise herein, any action by the city shall be by the city council, after consideration of the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation advisory board. Any proposal considered by the planning and zoning commission under this section shall have been reviewed by the parks and recreation advisory board, and its recommendation given to the commission.

(e)  If pretreatment or control is required, the control authority shall review the design and installation of equipment and processes. 
(f)  The design and installation of equipment and processes must conform to all applicable statutes, codes, ordinances and other laws. 
(g)  Right of revision. The control authority reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, or in individual wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this division. 
(h)  Prohibition against dilution as treatment. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(i)  The control authority may develop BMPs, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the requirements of this division. 
(Ord. No. 1923, § 1, 7-12-2011) 
Sec. 122-181. - User requirements. 
(a)  Accidental discharge/slug control plan. The control authority shall evaluate the need for a slug discharge control plan on every industrial user identified as significant. For industrial users identified as significant prior to November 14, 2005, this evaluation must have been conducted at least once by October 14, 2006. For industrial users identified after November 14, 2005, this evaluation must be evaluated within one year of being designated a significant industrial user. The control authority may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the control authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan will address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  A description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any accidental or slug discharge, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403, as required by subsection (g)(2) of this section; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Procedures must include inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(b)  Slug control record keeping. The control authority is required to keep records of the activities associated with the slug control evaluation and results are required to be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(c)  Monitoring facilities: 
(1)  Each user must provide and operate, at the user's own expense, a monitoring facility or control manhole to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each discharge to the POTW. The control authority may require the User to install specific monitoring equipment as necessary. Each monitoring facility will be situated on the user's premises, except where the location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user. The city may allow the monitoring facility to be constructed in a public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is located so that landscaping or parked vehicles will not obstruct it; 
(2)  There must be ample room in or near each sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, measuring, and monitoring equipment must be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy. All monitoring facilities must be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications; and 
(d)  Pretreatment facilities: 
(1)  Any person responsible for discharges requiring pretreatment, flow equalization, or other facilities must provide, operate, and maintain the facilities in effective operating condition and at his own expense; 
(2)  Users must provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and must achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, BMP's, and the prohibitions set out in this division within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the control authority, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance must be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing the facilities and operating procedures must be submitted to the control authority for review, and must be acceptable to the control authority before the facilities are constructed. Control authority review of all plans and operating procedures does not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the control authority under the provisions of this division; 
(3)  The control authority may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and any other conditions that may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division; 
(4)  The control authority may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow; and 
(5)  Users with potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(e)  Sampling and testing: 
(1)  The control authority will select the time, frequency, type, and methods of sampling and analysis; 
(2)  Sampling containers, preservation, techniques, and holding times will be conducted in accordance with the proper sampling and preservation procedures in 40 CFR 136 (as may be amended), unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain analytical techniques for a pollutant in question, analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or TCEQ; 
(3)  Except as indicated in subparagraph (6) below, flow proportional composite collection techniques must be used: 
a.  Each individual grab sample is either combined with the others or analyzed individually and the results averaged. In time composite sampling the samples are collected after equal time intervals and combined in proportion to the rate of flow when the sample was collected. Flow composite sampling can be produced in one of two ways: (1) By collecting equal volume individual grab samples after a specific volume of flow passes the sampling point; or (2) by varying the volume of the aliquot collected in proportion to the amount of flow that passed over the time interval that the sample represents. Composite samples are designed to be representative of the effluent conditions by reflecting the average conditions during the entire sampling period. 
b.  If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the control authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples when the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
(4)  To preserve the integrity of samples a written chain-of-custody is required to be used in all cases of sampling. 
(5)  Examinations and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes required by this division shall be: 
a.  Analytical results shall be analyzed to at least the minimum quantification levels as established by EPA or the minimum analytical levels as established by the TCEQ or as required by the control authority; and 
b.  Determined from suitable samples taken at a control point authorized by the control authority. 
(7)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(8)  The control authority may select an independent firm or laboratory to determine flow, and perform pollutant analysis. 
(9)  Should a user desire a determination of quality of wastes at times other than those designated by the control authority, special determination may be made by the control authority at the expense of the person discharging the wastes. 
(f)  Inspection: 
(1)  The EPA, TCEQ, and control authority may inspect the property, premises, and monitoring facilities of any user to determine compliance with the requirements of this division. The user must allow the EPA, TCEQ, and control authority or its representatives, upon presentation of credentials or identification, to enter upon the premises of the user at all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying. Entry and access to the facility will be made without delay. The control authority has the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and metering operations. 
(2)  The EPA, TCEQ, and control authority may randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing non-compliance with pretreatment standards. The control authority will inspect and sample each significant industrial user at least once a year. 
(g)  Accidental discharges: 
(1)  Each user must provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this division. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials will be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense; and 
(2)  Detailed plans showing facilities and operational procedures must be submitted to the control authority for review before construction of the facility. No user will be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until the control authority has reviewed these accidental discharge protection procedures. Review of the plans and operating procedures by the control authority does not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. 
(h)  Operating upsets. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought in municipal or state court for noncompliance if it can prove that an event that would otherwise be a violation of this division was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe. 
(i)  Prohibition of bypass: 
(1)  There shall be no unauthorized or intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(2)  A user may allow a bypass if it is essential for maintenance to assure efficient operations and if it does not violate pretreatment standards or other requirements. 
(3)  For anticipated required bypasses, the users must notify the control authority at least ten days prior to the needed bypass. The control authority may approve or disapprove a requested bypass. An unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards will require verbal notification to the control authority within 24 hours of knowledge of the bypass. Written notification from the user to the control authority (including a description of the bypass, the cause, the duration with dates and times, time it will be corrected if not already corrected, and steps taken or planned to reduce/eliminate/prevent reoccurrence) will be required within five days of the user becoming aware of the bypass. The control authority may waive the requirement for a written report on a case-by-case basis. 
(4)  Bypasses will not result in enforcement action if: 
a.  It was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass. This condition is not met if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable judgment; or 
c.  The user submitted notice as required. 
(Ord. No. 1923, § 1, 7-12-2011) 
Sec. 122-182. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports: 
(1)  Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW must submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. At least 90 days prior to the commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, must submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. A new source must report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source must also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. The control authority may request updates to this report as deemed necessary. 
(2)  Users described in subsection (a)(1) of this section must submit the information set forth below: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner; 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
c.  Descriptions of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by the user. This description should include a schematic process diagram that indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated process; and 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants: 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated processes for existing sources; 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and mass, where required by the standard or by the control authority, or regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample must be representative of daily operations and must be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection 122-181(e)(1) through (6). Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard; 
3.  The user must take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirement of this section; and 
4.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewater is mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403 to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403, this adjusted limit along with supporting data must be submitted the control authority. 
5.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report that uses only historical data so long as the data provided information is sufficient to determine the need for pretreatment measures. 
6.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed and certified by the user's authorized representative, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional O&M or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the following requirements: 
1.  A schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
2.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
3.  The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increments of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified. 
(b)  Self monitoring or periodic compliance reports. The following conditions apply: 
(1)  All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by control authority submit no less than twice per year (June and December for categorical and April and October for non-categorical users), reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All reports must be signed and certified; 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities must be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge; 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 122-182(l), the results of this monitoring must be included in the report; and 
(4)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements must submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in subsection (a)(2)d. through f. of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403, this report must contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report must include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified. 
(d)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user must also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Re-sampling by the industrial user is not required if the control authority performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the control authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. All notice of violation and repeat sampling reports must be signed and certified. 
(e)  Reports of potential problems: 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user must immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification must include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user; 
(2)  Within five days following the discharge, the user will, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification do not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor does such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability that may be imposed pursuant to this division. All reports of potential problems must be signed and certified; and 
(3)  A notice must be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other predominate place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. Employers will ensure that employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(f)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the control authority of any significant changes to the user's operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(1)  The control authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(2)  The control authority may issue a new permit or modify an existing permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Report from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must provide appropriate reports to the control authority upon request to verify compliance with this division. In no case shall a time period for submittal exceed 30 days without prior approval by the control authority. 
(h)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(i)  Records retention. All users subject to this division must retain, preserve and make available for inspection and copying, for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis made by or on behalf of the user, and documentation associated with BMPs, in connection with the user's discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the control authority must be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation to any and all appeals have expired. Records must include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, the name of the person taking the sample; the date the analyses were performed and who performed it; analytical techniques or methods used; and results. 
(j)  Hazardous waste notification. The control authority prohibits the discharge of hazardous waste to the POTW. Should an accidental discharge of hazardous waste occur, the user must immediately notify the control authority, the U.S. EPA, and TCEQ of the nature of the discharge and any response actions taken. If an industrial user wants a variance from this general exclusion, they must notify the control authority, the regional EPA Waste Management Division Director, and TCEQ hazardous waste authorities in writing of any proposed discharge to the POTW of a substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Only after a thorough review of the proposed hazardous waste discharge (waste identification, waste number, type of discharge, volume of discharge) and with the written consent of the EPA and TCEQ hazardous waste management authorities, will the control authority consider a variance from this exclusion. If these conditions are all met, then the control authority may allow a qualified industrial user to discharge the prescribed hazardous waste through the issuance of a variance to this section. The variance will be granted in writing by the control authority and will indicate the specific nature and volume of the hazardous waste discharge that is permitted and the terms and conditions of the discharge. 
(k)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report must be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or when the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by EPA. 
(l)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by control authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsection (a) and (c) of this section, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For reports required by subsection (b) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(e)  Adjustment of surcharges. 
(1)  The city may adjust surcharges, if warranted, to reflect changes in the characteristics of wastewater based on the results of sampling and test. 
(2)  Adjustments to surcharges will be effective immediately upon a determination of quality and quantity of wastes and will remain in effect until further sampling indicates a need to modify the surcharges. 
(3)  The city will review the basis for determining surcharges and may adjust the unit treatment cost to reflect increases or decreases in wastewater treatment costs. 
(4)  The city will bill the user by the month and will list industrial waste surcharges as a separate item to the regular bill for water and sewer charges. The user shall pay monthly in accordance with practices existing for payment of sewer charges. 
(f)  Failure to pay. In addition to sanctions provided for by this division, the city is entitled to exercise sanctions provided for by the other ordinances of the city for failure to pay the bill for water and sanitary sewer service when due. 
(Ord. No. 1923, § 1, 7-12-2011) 
Sec. 122-185. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The control authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and equitable relief, including a requirement that the user conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Criminal prosecution. A user who violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of a minimum of $1,000.00 per day for each violation but not to exceed $2,000.00 per day for each violation. Each additional day or fractional part thereof for any violation of this division constitutes a separate offense. 
(c)  Civil penalties or administrative fines. Any user who is found to have violated an order of the city or who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, and the regulations, or rules of the city, or orders of any court of competent jurisdiction (or permits, or any other pretreatment standards or requirements, issued hereunder), may be subjected to the imposition of a civil penalty at a minimum of $1,000.00 per day for each violation, not to exceed $2,000.00 per violation per day for each violation, or an administrative fine at a minimum $200.00 per day for each violation. Each additional day or fractional part thereof for any violation of this division constitutes a separate offense. 
(d)  Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the city with respect to the conduct of a user contrary to the provisions of this division, the city attorney may, following the authorization of the city, commence an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief as provided for by law. 
(e)  Enforcement response plan. Any violation of this division will be acted upon in accordance with the control authority's established enforcement response plan. 
(f)  Power to enter property. The EPA, TCEQ, and control authority or their representatives, upon presentation of credentials or identification, have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying will the requirements of this division and any discharge permit, or order issued hereunder. Users must allow the EPA, TCEQ, or control authority ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  When a user has security measures which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangement with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the control authority is permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The control authority has the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected or sampled must be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control authority and must not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(4)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority access to the user's premises are a violation of this division. 
(5)  If the control authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program design to verify compliance with this division or any permit, BMP, or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the control authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the municipal court of the City of Bryan, Texas. 
(g)  Notice. The control authority shall serve users discharging in violation of this division with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for satisfactory compliance. Failure of the control authority to provide notice does not limit the authority of the control authority to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action. 
(h)  Continuing prohibited discharges. No user may continue discharging in violation of this division beyond the time limit provided in the notice without prior approval by the controlling authority. 
(i)  Notification of violation-Administrative adjustment. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, must be submitted by the user to the control authority. Submission of this plan does not relieve the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the control authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(j)  Significant noncompliance. Whenever the control authority finds that a user meets the criteria of significant noncompliance, as defined in section 122-177, the control authority shall issue a penalty to the user in accordance with subsection 122-185(3), and information about the user shall be published in the newspaper in accordance with subsection (k), of this section, if applicable. 
(k)  Annual publication. A list of all users which were the subject of enforcement proceedings pursuant to this section during the 12 previous months, shall be annually published by the control authority in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice in the municipality in which the city is located, summarizing the enforcement actions taken against the users during the same 12 months whose violations remained uncorrected 30 or more days after notification of noncompliance; or were considered significantly noncompliant; or which have exhibited a pattern of noncompliance, or which involve failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(l)  Recovery of costs incurred by the city. Any person violating any of the provisions of this division; or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction; or causes damage to or impairs the POTW is liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violation or discharge. The city will bill the user for the costs incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, replacement, clean-up or remediation work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs constitutes a violation of this division enforceable under the provisions of this section. 
(m)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, (or POTW), or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division may, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with this section. In addition the control authority is entitled to pursue all other criminal and civil remedies to which it is entitled under authority of statutes or other ordinances against a person continuing prohibited discharges. 
(n)  Consent orders. The control authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this section and are judicially enforceable. 
(o)  Compliance/administrative orders. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, wastewater service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(p)  Cease and desist orders. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or terminating the discharge. 
(q)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(r)  Authority to disconnect service. 
(1)  The control authority may terminate water and wastewater disposal service and disconnect a user from the system when: 
a.  Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment process are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper conveyance and treatment of wastewater; 
b.  A governmental agency informs the control authority that the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge to a watercourse, and it is found that the user is delivering wastewater to the POTW that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by the POTW as normal domestic treatment; or 
c.  The user: 
1.  Discharges industrial waste or wastewater that is in violation of the permit or BMP issued by the control authority; 
2.  Discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment system; 
3.  Fails to pay monthly bills for water and sanitary sewer services when due and after receiving due process as required by law; 
4.  Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes to public sewers; 
5.  Violates provisions of this division; 
6.  Fails to accurately report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents, volume, and characteristics of its discharge; or 
7.  Refuses reasonable access to the premises for inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
(2)  The control authority will: 
a.  Disconnect the user; 
b.  If applicable, supply the user with the governmental agency's report and provide the user with all pertinent information; and 
c.  Continue disconnection until the industrial user provides additional pretreatment or other facilities designed to remove the objectionable characteristics from their industrial wastes. 
(s)  Emergency suspension of service. The control authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspensions is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The control authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment, or violate any wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this division. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge must immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply with the suspension order, the control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The control authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the control authority that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings of this division are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment must submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences, to the control authority prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under this section. 
(t)  Revocation of permit. The control authority may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limiting to the following reasons: 
(1)  Fails to notify the control authority of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
(2)  Failure to provide prior notification to the control authority of changed conditions pursuant to this division;

(10)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(11)  Failure to complete advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; or 
(12)  Violation of any ordinance, pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit. 
(u)  Termination of discharge. Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in this division. 
(v)  Users will be notified of the proposed termination of their discharge and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under the provisions of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the control authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(w)  Show cause hearing. The control authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the control authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the control authority that shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the user. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the user in accordance with the local ordinances. 
(x)  Right of appeal. Any user or any interested party has the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the city on any matter covered by this division and is entitled to a prompt written reply. If the inquiry is by a user and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this division or deals with a wastewater discharge permit for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a user's request will stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this division may be taken in accordance with local and state law. 
(1)  Failure to submit a timely appeal will be deemed as a waiver of the appeal process. 
(2)  The effectiveness of the permit will not be stayed pending the appeal. 
(3)  If the control authority fails to act within 60 days, the appeal is deemed to be denied. 
(y)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The control authority may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will be in accordance with the POTW enforcement response plan. The control authority may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. The control authority may take more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant user.

Any adopted design guidelines and Secretary of the Interior's Standards shall be on file within the planning and development services department and made available to the public. 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object, or site and its environment.

(5)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object, or site shall be kept when possible. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.

(10)  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures, objects, or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the building, structure, object, or site would be unimpaired. 
(11)  Any design guidelines adopted by the historic landmark commission or city council. 
(f)  Certificate of appropriateness application procedure.

(2)  Building permits shall not be issued for such proposed work until a certificate of appropriateness has first been issued by the historic landmark commission. The certificate of appropriateness required by this act shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the City of Bryan. 
(3)  The historic landmark commission shall review the application during a public meeting within 45 days from the date the application is received. The historic landmark commission shall act upon the certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the meeting. In the event the historic landmark commission does not act within 90 days of the receipt of the application, a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed granted. The historic landmark commission's decision is limited to approve, approve with modifications; suspension of action for a specified time or deny.

(g)  Economic hardship application procedure. 
(1)  After receiving written notification from the historic landmark commission of the denial of certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may commence the hardship process to obtain necessary building or demolition permits. No building permit or demolition permit shall be issued unless the historic landmark commission makes a finding that hardship exists. When a claim of economic hardship is made due to the effect of this chapter, the owner must demonstrate to the Historic landmark commission that: 
a.  the property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; 
b.  the property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and 
c.  efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed. 
(2)  The applicant shall consult with the historic landmark commission, local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property. Such efforts must be shown to the historic landmark commission. 
(3)  The historic landmark commission shall hold a public hearing on the application within 60 days from the date the application is received by the building official, historic preservation Officer, or his/her designee.

(5)  Hardships shall not be granted if they are a result of the owner's actions. 
(h)  Ordinary maintenance in a historic preservation overlay district. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, in-kind replacement, and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a property within a historic preservation overlay district which does not involve a change in design, material, or outward appearance. When the building official, historic preservation officer, or his/her designee determines work has progressed beyond ordinary maintenance, the commission shall review a request for a certificate of appropriateness. 
(i)  Demolition by neglect. Owners or persons with an interest in real property included within a historic preservation overlay district shall not permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior feature which would produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the historic preservation overlay district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. Examples of such deterioration may include, but shall not be limited to: 
(1)  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports. 
(2)  Deterioration of roof or other horizontal members. 
(3)  Deterioration of exterior chimneys.

The PD, planned development district accommodates planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units such as industrial districts, offices, commercial or service centers, shopping centers, residential developments of multifamily or mixed housing including attached single-family dwellings or any appropriate combination of uses which may be planned, developed or operated as integral land use units either by a single owner or a combination of owners. A PD district may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this chapter. While greater flexibility is given to allow special conditions or restrictions which would not otherwise allow the development to occur, procedures are established herein to ensure against misuse of increased flexibility. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Any use or combination of uses authorized by the planning and zoning commission and the city council is permitted in a PD district if the use is consistent with the following categories: 
(1)  Planned development-housing (PD-H). Any use permitted in the RD-7, RD-5, and MF districts are permitted in a PD-H development. 
(2)  Planned development-business (PD-B). Any use permitted in the C-1, C-2, and C-3 districts are permitted in a PD-B development, excluding residential uses.

A development plan for the proposed planned development shall be required that shows the location of the planned development and the relationship of the various land uses included in the development. The form and content of the development plan shall be in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision ordinance regarding development plans. Development requirements for each separate PD district shall be included as a part of the development plan for each PD district and shall include, but may not be limited to: uses, density, lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard depths and widths, building height, building elevations, coverage, floor area ratio, parking, access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signs, lighting, project phasing or scheduling, management associations, and other requirements as the city council and the planning and zoning commission may deem appropriate. The preparation of preliminary and final plats for the development shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision ordinance and with any modifications approved by the planning and zoning commission on the development plan.

No structure, parking lot, equipment pad, or other manmade construction not approved by the city shall be placed in an open space buffer. The size and location of these buffers shall be determined by the planning and zoning commission upon review of the development plan for the proposed development. The minimum size of an open space buffer shall be 25 feet measured from the exterior property line. Landscaping may be required within the buffer based on the location of existing development, the type of development, topography, or other criteria established by the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  Where structures within the planned development that exceed 35 feet in height are proposed to be erected on lots adjacent to RD-7, RD-5, MU-1, or A-O districts, such structures shall be located one foot from the boundary of the open space buffer described in section 130-25(c)(4)a for each 2 feet of height over 35 feet. 
c.  Planned developments designated as PD-B, PD-I, or PD-M shall have frontage along and access to a major arterial street on at least one side of the proposed development. Access through a residential area to a PD-B, PD-I, or PD-M via a local street is prohibited. 
d.  The Planning and zoning commission or the city council shall not approve a planned development if it finds that the proposed planned development: 
e.  Does not conform with applicable regulations and standards established by this chapter: 
1.  Is not compatible with existing or permitted uses on abutting sites, in terms of use, building height, bulk and scale, setbacks and open spaces, landscaping, drainage, or access and circulation features, within the standards established by this section; 
2.  Potentially creates unfavorable effects or impacts on other existing or permitted uses on abutting sites that cannot be mitigated by the provisions of this section;

4.  Fails to reasonably protect persons and property from erosion, flood or water damage, fire, noise, glare, and similar hazards or impacts; 
5.  Adversely affects traffic control or adjacent properties by inappropriate location, lighting, or types of signs; or 
6.  Will be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity, for reasons specifically articulated by the commission. 
(5)  Unless otherwise specified in the approved development plan the minimum requirements for each development shall be those stated in the subdivision ordinance (chapter 110) and the requirements of the most restrictive standard zoning district in which designated uses are permitted. There are no maximum height restrictions for planned developments except those noted in section 130-25(c). The maximum housing density permitted in any planned development shall be no more than 50 dwelling units per acre. 
(6)  The granting of a PD designation shall not relieve the developer from responsibility for complying with all other applicable codes and ordinances of the city unless such relief is specified in the approved development plan. 
(7)  An owners association will be required if other satisfactory arrangements have not been made for providing, operating, and maintaining common facilities including streets, drives, service and parking areas, common open spaces, and common recreational areas at the time the development plan is submitted. If an owners association is required, the articles of incorporation of an owners association shall be reviewed by the City to assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Zoning district map. All PD districts approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in its original form, or by subsequent amendments thereto, shall be referenced on the zoning district map, and a list of such PD districts, together with the category of uses permitted therein, shall be kept on file in the office of the city secretary or his or her designee.

The purpose of the additional setback is to establish a buffer area to help mitigate noise, lighting, and other possible adverse impacts. No development shall be authorized within the buffer area except for required or permitted landscaping and screening, stormwater detention facilities, and pedestrian walkways. The increased setbacks, which are measured from the property line, shall be required on the property in the higher intensity zoning district, and shall be observed at the time of construction. These buffer requirements are in addition to the screening standards set forth in section 130-37. 
(b)  The depth of the side and rear buffer setbacks shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  One hundred feet in the I, industrial district and for municipal services support facilities when siding or backing on to C-2, retail, C-1, office, MU-2, mixed use district and all residential districts.

(c)  The depth of the buffer area may be reduced by the equivalent area of landscaping provided within the buffer area. No reductions in the setback area will be allowed where no landscaping is provided parallel to the property lines. In no event shall the reductions eliminate the standard setbacks provided in Chapter 62. Landscaping used in place of screening, allowed in section 130-37, shall not be used to reduce the buffer area. Square feet of coverage shall be based on the standards provided in all other applicable sections and/or ordinances. The request for reducing the buffer shall be submitted with a landscape plan. The minimum depth of the reduced buffer shall be: 
(1)  Sixty feet in the I, industrial district and municipal services support facilities when siding or backing on to C-2, retail, C-1, office, MU-2, mixed use, and all residential districts. 
(2)  Forty-five feet in the C-3, commercial district and for essential municipal uses when siding or backing on to C-1, office and all residential districts.

Sec. 130-33. - Conditional use permits. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the conditional use permit process is to identify those uses which might be appropriate within a zoning district but, due to either their location, function, or operation, could have a potentially harmful impact on adjacent properties or the surrounding area; and to provide for a procedure whereby such uses might be permitted by further restricting or conditioning them so as to mitigate or eliminate such adverse impacts. 
(b)  Authority. The planning and zoning commission may approve a conditional use permit for a use in any district in which such use is authorized under the conditional use list following proper application, and after notice to landowners within 200 feet of the subject property ten days before the date of the public hearing and in accordance with the procedures and criteria herein established. 
(c)  Application and site plan required. No building permit for a use authorized only as a conditional use within a zoning district shall be issued unless the applicant obtains a conditional use permit from the planning and zoning commission. The application for a conditional use permit shall be accompanied by a site plan as required for nonresidential and multifamily development in article III of chapter 62. The planning and zoning commission may require additional information or plans as necessary for review. 
(d)  Review and evaluation criteria. 
(1)  The planning and zoning commission shall not approve a plan for development of a conditional use if it finds the proposed development: 
a.  Does not conform with applicable regulations and standards established by this chapter; 
b.  Is not compatible with existing or permitted uses on abutting sites, in terms of use, building height, bulk and scale, setbacks and open spaces, landscaping, drainage, or access and circulation features; 
c.  Potentially creates greater unfavorable effects or impacts on other existing or permitted uses on abutting sites than those which reasonably may result from the use of the site by a permitted use; 
d.  Adversely affects the safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity, including traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use and other uses reasonably anticipated in the area considering existing zoning and land uses in the area; 
e.  Fails to reasonably protect persons and property from erosion, flood or water damage, fire, noise, glare, and similar hazards or impacts; 
f.  Adversely affects traffic control or adjacent properties by inappropriate location, lighting, or types of signs; 
g.  Fails to provide adequate and convenient off-street parking and loading facilities; 
h.  Fails to conform with the objectives and the purpose of the zoning district in which the development is located; 
i.  Will be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity, for reasons specifically articulated by the commission; or 
j.  The premises or structures are not suitable for the proposed use. 
(2)  Conditional use site plans considered by the planning and zoning commission shall be approved only after the planning and zoning commission finds that the proposed development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and all conditions deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission may establish such conditions of approval as are necessary to assure that the use meets the criteria set forth in section 130-33(d)(1), which may include without limitation requirements for special yards, lot sizes, open spaces, buffers, fences, walls or screening; requirements for installation and maintenance of landscaping or erosion control measures; requirements for street improvements and dedications, regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation; regulation of signs; regulation of hours or other characteristics of operation; establishment of development schedules or time limits for performance or completion; and such other conditions as the planning and zoning commission may deem necessary to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses and to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare. In imposing such conditions, the planning and zoning commission may act upon variance requests, subject to the same standards governing variances under section 130-41. 
(e)  Compliance. 
(1)  In granting a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission may impose conditions which shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the chief building official for use of the building on such property pursuant to such conditional use permit and such conditions precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. Any special conditions shall be set forth in writing by the planning and zoning commission in conjunction with approval of the conditional use permit. 
(2)  No conditional use permit shall be granted unless the applicant, owner or grantee of the conditional use permit is willing to accept and agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements of the conditional use permit, as attached to the site plan drawing (or drawings) and as approved by the planning and zoning commission. A conditional use permit shall remain valid until such time as one of the following actions is taken: 
a.  The property is rezoned and the site is no longer listed as a conditional use; 
b.  Another conditional use permit is approved for the site; 
c.  The use of the premises changes; or 
d.  Access and construction-related permits necessary for completion of any site development plan have not been issued within 12 months of the site development review committee's approval (See nonresidential and multifamily development in article III of chapter 62). 
(3)  No building, premises, or land used under a conditional use permit may be substantially changed unless a separate conditional use permit is granted for the change. In the event a change is not considered substantial, the chair of the site development review committee may approve the change or forward to the site development review committee if the change affects the health, safety, or welfare of the public. 
(4)  Failure to implement and maintain the conditions as specified by the planning and zoning commission in granting a conditional use permit is punishable by the provisions of section 130-45. 
(f)  Appeal to city council. Approval or denial of an application for a conditional use permit, may be appealed to the city council by the applicant for the permit or any owner of property located within 200 feet of the subject property. Written notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal must be delivered to the planning and development services department within ten calendar days after the date of the planning and zoning commission's decision.

They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, for the character of the district, and its suitability and compatibility for the particular uses specified; and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and neighborhoods, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the City. The provisions of this chapter are designed and intended to minimize the negative or adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment uses on the community. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to condone or legitimize any activity that may be illegal under other applicable law. 
(2)  Locational regulations. It is the intent of the city council that the locational regulations of this chapter are promulgated pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 243.001 et seq., as it applies to nude model studios and sexual encounter centers only. It is the intent of the city council that all other provisions of this chapter are promulgated pursuant to the City Charter and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211 et seq. and other applicable law regarding zoning. 
(3)  Legislative findings concerning adult uses. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and including findings incorporated in the cases of Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41 (1986); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); H and A Land Properties v. City of Kennedale, 480 F.3d 336 (5th Cir. 2007), including the studies referenced in these cases, such as in H and A Land Properties v. City of Kennedale, 480 F.3d 336 (5th Cir. 2007) which contains and references studies in other communities, the city council finds that: 
a.  Legislative finding number 1: The city council finds that V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211, et seq., authorized home rule cities to divide cities into districts and regulate the use of property within the districts for the purpose of promotion of the health, safety and morals of the public, and for the protection of the general welfare of the community. 
b.  Legislative finding number 2: The City Council finds that V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211, et seq., authorized home rule cities to promulgate and enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health, life and property of the public, and to preserve the good government, order and security of such cities and their inhabitants. 
c.  Legislative finding number 3: The city council finds that V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §243, et seq., where the Texas legislature found that the unrestricted operation of certain sexually oriented businesses may be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and business neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity, and provided that does not diminish the authority of a local government to regulate sexually oriented businesses with regard to any matters, recognizes the negative secondary effects of such businesses. 
d.  Legislative finding number 4: V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, § 215.004 authorized home rule cities to enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health, life, and property, and to preserve the good government, order and security of such cities and their inhabitants. 
e.  Legislative finding number 5: The city council finds that studies conducted in other cities and states throughout the country have shown a decline in neighborhoods and neighborhood-oriented commercial, religious, and institutional facilities when exposed to sexually oriented or adult entertainment businesses as a negative secondary effect, and the result would not differ in the City of Bryan. 
f.  Legislative finding number 6: The city council finds that the Supreme Court of the United States and the Fifth Circuit for the United States Court of Appeals have upheld the validity of such controls that locate these kinds of activities within zoning districts that are less sensitive to their blighting influences and other negative secondary influences. 
g.  Legislative finding number 7: The city council finds, based upon the experiences of the cities in Texas and elsewhere in the country, that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 
h.  Legislative finding number 8: The city council further finds, based upon the experiences of the cities in Texas and elsewhere in the country, that police departments of various communities have made a substantial number of arrests for sexually related crimes in adult entertainment establishments. 
i.  Legislative finding number 9: The city council finds that "adult entertainment" businesses, due to their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in adjacent areas. 
j.  Legislative finding number 10: The city council finds that there is convincing documentary and legislative evidence that sexually oriented businesses or "adult entertainment" as to be defined under the Bryan Code, because of their very nature, have deleterious, negative secondary effects on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the consequent downgrading of property values. Numerous studies, reports, and findings concerning the harmful effect of adult entertainment uses on surrounding land uses and neighborhoods have been produce before the Bryan city council. One such example that has been presented to and considered by the city council is the opinion of the Fifth Circuit for the United States Court of Appeals in H and A Land Properties v. City of Kennedale, 480 F.3d 336 (5th Cir. 2007), and the 2 studies approved by the Fifth Circuit as being evidence regarding the negative secondary effects of the sale of materials for off-site use, (1) "Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis" by Department of Metropolitan Development on Indianapolis (1984) and (2) the "Adult Entertainment Business in City of Oklahoma City", by the Community Development Department of Oklahoma City, in 1986, which have been also presented to and considered by the City Council, as well as various documentary evidence including studies from other cities and other evidence presented to the City Council at the hearings on this ordinance, including studies filed in the lower court in the City of Kennedale case, in Cause Number Civil Action No. 4:05-CV-166-A, in the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, including the opinions, reports and affidavits of (i) Connie B. Cooper, FAICP, Expert Report; (ii) Expert Report of Richard McClearly PhD.; (iii) the summary of the study performed by April Virnig, dated July 3, 2003, for the City of Kennedale, which reference and describe certain studies such as: 
1.  Those studies noted and approved in H and A Land Properties v. City of Kennedale, 480 F.3d 336 (5th Cir. 2007), including 2 studies for sale of materials for off-site use (1) "Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis" by Department of Metropolitan Development on Indianapolis (1984) and (2) The City of Oklahoma City, by the Community Development Department in 1986. The Indianapolis survey, conducted by the City of Indianapolis in conjunction with Indiana University School of Business, Division of Research, polled 20 percent of the national membership of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers. Eighty percent of the respondents predicted that an adult bookstore would negatively impact residential property values, and 72 percent believed commercial property value would also be negatively impacted. The Oklahoma City study, which surveyed 100 Oklahoma City real estate appraisers, produced similar results: 74 percent predicted a negative impact on real estate value in the surrounding area. 
2.  Amarillo, Texas. In 1977, the Amarillo Planning Department prepared a report entitled, "A Report on Entertainment Uses in Amarillo." The report concluded that adult entertainment uses have adverse impacts on surrounding land uses, and that those impacts can be distinguished from those of other businesses. The study found that street crime rates were considerably above the city's average in those areas immediately surrounding the adult-only businesses, and that late at night, during their primary operating hours, those businesses create unique problems of noise, glare, and traffic. 
3.  Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1984, Indianapolis surveyed real estate experts on the impact that adult entertainment uses had on surrounding property values. A random sample (20 percent) of the national membership of the American Institute of Real Estate appraisers was used. The opinion survey found that an adult bookstore located in the hypothetical neighborhood described would have a negative impact on residential property values of premises located within one block of the site. 
4.  "Report of the Attorney General Working Group for the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Business", June, 1989, that references and analyzes a number of studies on communities across the country. For example, in 1987, the planning department of St. Paul, Minnesota completed a study entitled "Effect of Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses." The study concluded that: 
(i)  There was a statistically significant correlation between neighborhood deterioration as reflected in housing values and crime rates and the location of adult entertainment businesses; 
(ii)  The statistical relationship was still significant after taking into account certain marketing factors; and 
(iii)  There was a stronger correlation with neighborhood deterioration after establishment of an adult entertainment business than before. 
5.  Austin, Texas. In May, 1986, the Austin Planning Department published a report on adult businesses in Austin. An analysis of crime rates in Austin was conducted by comparing areas with adult businesses to areas without adult businesses. Four study areas were chosen that did not contain adult businesses. Two study areas were chosen containing only one adult business each, and two study areas were chosen containing two adult businesses each. Within those study areas containing adult businesses, sex crimes were found to be from two to nearly five times the city-wide average. Also, sex-related crime rates were found to be 66 percent higher in study areas containing 2 adult businesses as compared to study areas containing only one adult business. Austin also conducted a survey of 120 real estate appraisers and lending institutions. Eighty-eight percent of those responding indicated a belief that an adult bookstore would decrease residential property values within one block, and 59 percent felt that residential property values would decrease within three blocks. A survey of three adult businesses in Austin revealed that only three customers had addresses within one mile of an adult business and 44 percent of all customers visiting the three adult businesses had addresses outside the City of Austin. 
k.  Legislative finding number 11: The city council is relying on the findings and studies listed above and is attempting to benefit the public welfare by proposing, examining and adopting zoning rules, definitions and provisions related to adult entertainment. 
1.  It is the express intent of the city council to ensure that the adverse effects created by "adult entertainment" are minimized and controlled so as not to cause or contribute to crime, increased blighting, or downgrading of adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood. 
2.  The regulations established herein are intended to protect and preserve the quality, property values, integrity and character of the city's neighborhoods and commercial districts, deter the spread of urban blights, and protect the citizens of the city from the objectionable effects of sexually oriented businesses. 
l.  Legislative finding number 12: The city council finds, from the studies that have been presented, that, because of their very nature, adult entertainment uses can and should be relegated to nonresidential and non-retail zoning districts. 
m.  Legislative finding number 13: 
1.  The city council finds, based on the purposes and legislative findings set out in this ordinance and from the studies noted in legislative finding number 5, that adult entertainment uses should be an allowed use in the I, industrial district (section 130-23). The city council finds that there will be adequate locations for "adult entertainment" within the city in the area zoned industrial for those uses already permitted in that district, and will not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication, while minimizing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment and providing the other purposes noted herein. There will be a sufficient number of sites provided by placing dispersed sites for "adult entertainment" in the industrial district. The industrial district composes approximately 33 percent of the area in the City of Bryan that is not zoned for residential types or agricultural types of uses. The areas inside those designated as industrial district, are already served by Bryan infrastructure with respect to utilities, streets and other services, or such infrastructure is readily available. 
2.  Further, the city council finds, based on the purposes and legislative findings set out in section 130-23 and from the studies noted in legislative finding number 5, that there will be a sufficient number of sites provided by requiring dispersed sites for "adult entertainment" under section 130-23(g)(3), so as to allow for sufficient dispersal of such sites to prevent concentrations, thereby minimizing the adverse secondary effects, while not unreasonably limiting alternative avenues of communication, and providing the other purposes noted herein. 
(d)  Special height limitations. The height limitations specified by this chapter and in building setbacks and lot standards (article IV of chapter 62) do not apply to cooling towers, chimneys, vent stacks, water stand pipes and tanks, steeples, spires, belfries, cupolas, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy.

(3)  Height and site development regulations. See article IX of chapter 62 for additional regulations that apply to wireless telecommunications facilities. 
(c)  Conditional use permits. Some minor transmission towers and all intermediate and major transmission towers require a conditional use permit (CUP) from the planning and zoning commission. The Planning and zoning commission may place additional conditions on the site where it deems necessary to do so to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public. The criteria in section 130-33 will govern the issuance of conditional use permits for WTFs. In addition to the standard criteria the following additional factors shall be considered when determining whether to grant a conditional use permit for WTFs: 
(1)  Height of the proposed tower, surrounding topography and surrounding tree coverage and foliage as they relate to: 
a.  Skyline impact, examining whether the proportions of the structure appear to "loom" over or blend in with the surrounding environment; and 
b.  Shadow impact, whether or not the proposed tower will cast shadows that would prevent the reasonable use or enjoyment of surrounding properties. 
(2)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
(3)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district/boundaries. 
(4)  Economic impact on adjacent and nearby properties. 
(5)  Proposed ingress and egress. 
(6)  Availability of suitable alternative, existing support structures.

Sec. 130-37. - Screening fence standards. 
(a)  Purpose. To encourage the most appropriate use of land and conserve and protect the privacy and value of adjacent permitted uses. Regulations are prescribed for the location and type of various screening devices to be used when required in the various zoning districts or in this section in accordance with the following standards. Screening regulations are required only when a full site plan review is required (see nonresidential and multifamily development in article III of chapter 62). 
(b)  Location of required screening. 
(1)  When it is determined that a zoning district sides or backs upon a noncompatible zoning district, a solid screening wall or fence shall be erected along the property line, and within the property with the higher intensity zoning district. The screening requirements shall be observed at the time of rezoning and/or construction, or upon a change in use of the property where the screening shall be imposed. The purpose for the screening is to provide a visual barrier between the properties. The owner of such property shall be responsible for and shall build the required wall or fence. All wall or fence openings shall be equipped with gates equal in height and screening characteristics to the wall or fence. Screening standards shall be in accordance with the following: 
a.  Screening required in the I, industrial district when siding or backing on to C-2, retail, C-1, office, MU-2, mixed use and all residential districts; 
b.  Screening required in the C-3, commercial district when siding or backing on to C-1, office district and all residential districts; 
c.  Screening required in the C-2, retail and C-1, office districts when siding or backing on to all residential districts; 
d.  Screening required in the MF, multiple-family district when siding or backing on to all other residential districts; 
e.  Screening required in all nonresidential districts when adjacent to a single-family residence located within an A-O, agricultural-open district and no farther than 100 feet from the nonresidential district boundary; 
f.  Screening required in all nonresidential developed tracts of land within or adjacent to an existing single-family residential development. 
(2)  In any district where loading areas are visible from a public street, screening shall be provided adjacent to the loading area along the street, allowing for required landscaping. These standards shall be imposed except where such use was in existence at the date of the original adoption of the zoning ordinance (December 11, 1989). 
(3)  Where permitted, outdoor storage must be screened when visible from any public right-of-way, allowing for required landscaping. An outdoor storage permit may be granted by the site development review committee for any exceptions to screening and/or landscaping requirements. A person who violates any section of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction is punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,000.00 per occurrence in accordance with general penalty provisions of City Code section 1-14. 
(4)  Dumpsters, not including containers 300 gallons or smaller, shall be placed on concrete dumpster pads six inches in thickness, 15 feet in width and 12 feet in depth. The pad shall be screened with a six-foot fence on three sides with the fourth side remaining open for access or being fitted with a gate matching the screening on the other three sides. 
(5)  Where screening is required, the following standards shall be observed: 
a.  Materials approved for use in screening fences are solid wood (not including plywood, particleboard, or similar composite), masonry (brick or stone), or a combination solid wood and masonry. Corrugated metal or fiberglass panels shall not be used as fence materials. Screening shall be provided that completely blocks the view of materials, commodities, or equipment stored. All screening materials shall be finished on the sides facing public rights-of-way. Other types of screening devices may be approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  Landscaping may be used for screening if the plant materials used are a minimum of four feet tall at the time they are planted. Any plant materials used for screening purposes shall be of an evergreen nature and shall be of sufficient height and type to completely block the view of materials, commodities or equipment stored from adjacent public rights-of-way or property. Any time that plant materials are used for screening purposes, the developer shall post a cash bond to be held in escrow by the city to cover replacement of plant materials. The amount of such bond shall be determined by the city planner or his or her designee. The bond shall be effective for two growing seasons from the time of the initial planting; any excess funds remaining from such bond shall be returned at the end of such period to the developer. 
c.  When screening is required to separate all other residential districts from either the MF, multiple-family or a nonresidential district, or when screening is required to separate nonresidential development from single-family residential development, any fence or wall shall be not less than six feet or exceed eight feet in height above the grade of the adjacent property. 
d.  Along the property line between nonresidential districts, or on property adjacent to loading areas, outdoor storage and refuse areas, where screening is required, a minimum six-foot high uniform screening shall be provided. 
(6)  In any residential district, the maximum height of any fence or wall in a required front setback of a single-family, townhouse, duplex, or patio home lot, shall be as provided: 
a.  Fencing, screening walls or the combination of berms and fences or screening walls shall not exceed 36 inches in height when placed a distance of 25 feet or less from the adjacent paved street surface. 
b.  Fencing, screening walls or the combination of berms and fences or screening walls shall not exceed six feet in height when placed a distance of more than 25 feet from the adjacent paved street surface. 
(7)  Where a fence is erected to the rear of the minimum required front setback line, the fence shall not exceed eight feet in height above the grade of the adjacent property. 
(8)  A wall or fence, not less than 54 inches in height, with a self-latching gate at all entrances, shall enclose a swimming pool area or surrounding yard area. 
(c)  Maintenance of screening fences. Any screening fence erected under the provisions of section 130-37 shall be maintained by replacing or repairing any dead, loose, damaged, or missing fencing materials within 30 days after notification by the zoning official. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 130-38. - Platting property not permanently zoned. 
(a)  The planning and zoning commission of the city shall not approve any plat of any subdivision within the city limits of the city until the area covered by the proposed plat shall have been permanently zoned by the city council of the city. A plat may be approved on land with the agricultural-open district designation if the proposed use of the property is determined to be the permanent use of the property. 
(b)  The planning and zoning commission of the city shall not approve any plat or any subdivision within any area where a petition or ordinance for annexation or a recommendation for annexation to the city is pending before the city council unless and until such annexation shall have been approved by ordinance by the city council. 
(c)  In the event the city council cannot schedule a public hearing on a proposed annexation, the planning and zoning commission, at its discretion, may hold a public hearing on the permanent zoning that is to be given to the area or tract to be annexed. The planning and zoning commission may make a recommendation on both the annexation and zoning to the city council so that the city council can, if it desires, act on the annexation with input from the planning and zoning commission regarding appropriate zoning. Zoning may not be placed on any property until the annexation ordinance has officially been adopted. 
(d)  See chapter 110 for platting requirements within the city's ETJ. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 130-39. - Classification of new and unlisted uses. 
    It is recognized that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the city. These may not be specified as a permitted use in any zoning district. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as follows: 
(1)  The planning and development services department shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage, anticipated employment, and transportation requirements likely to be generated and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use is most similar and should be permitted. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission shall forward its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council shall by resolution approve the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined appropriate based upon its findings. After such resolution, if a zoning change is required, the process specified in section 130-42 shall be followed. 
(4)  Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use. When determination of the minimum requirements cannot be readily ascertained, the same process outlined in section 130-39(a), section 130-39(b) and section 130-39(c) shall be followed for determination of the new standards. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 130-40. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  Intent of provisions. 
(1)  Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments thereto, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter was enacted, amended or otherwise made applicable to such lots, structures or uses, but which do not now conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. It is the intent of this chapter to permit such nonconforming uses and structures to continue, under regulations herein contained, until the same are removed. 
(2)  It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, and not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district except for any existing or approved municipal services support facilities. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved. 
(b)  Nonconforming status. Any use or structure which does not conform with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located shall be deemed a nonconforming use or structure when: 
(1)  Such use or structure was in existence and lawfully operating at the time of the passage of the ordinance on February 12, 1990, and has since been in regular and continuous use; 
(2)  Such use or structure is a lawful use at the time of the adoption of any amendment to this chapter but by such amendment is placed in a district wherein such use is not otherwise permitted and has since been in regular and continuous use; or 
(3)  Such use or structure was in existence at the time of annexation to the city and has since been in regular and continuous use. 
(c)  Continuing lawful use of property and existence of structures. 
(1)  The lawful use of land or lawful existence of structures at the time of the passage of this chapter, although such do not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued; but if said nonconforming use or structure is discontinued or abandoned, any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter unless conformity is not in the public interest as determined by the zoning board of adjustment. 
(2)  A nonconforming use, when such nonconforming use of land or structure ceases to be used in such manner for a period of 12 months, shall not be resumed and proof of such event constitutes prima facie evidence of discontinuance or abandonment. Any nonconforming uses which do not involve a permanent type of structure or operation, including manufactured housing, and which are moved from the premises shall be considered to have been abandoned. Nonconforming uses which do involve a permanent type of structure or operation shall not be considered abandoned if one or more of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The property has been advertised for sale or lease and actively marketed; 
b.  The premises has been advertised for sale or lease and actively marketed; 
c.  All licenses, permits, or certifications required for operation have been kept current since the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(3)  No nonconforming use or structure may be expanded or increased beyond the lot or tract upon which such nonconforming use is located as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived except as provided in section 130-40. These provisions apply to any owner or subsequent owner of a nonconforming use as authorized herein. 
(4)  In those districts where mobile/manufactured homes are considered nonconforming structures, but single-family detached dwellings are a permitted use, an owner of a nonconforming mobile/manufactured home may replace a nonconforming mobile home destroyed by fire, the elements, or other cause, with another mobile home of equal or less square footage. 
(d)  Changing nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use, and once such change is made, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(2)  Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the use may be changed to another conforming use by securing a certificate of occupancy from the chief building official. 
(3)  A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that adverse impacts (such as more traffic, noise, vibration, etc.) are not increased. 
(e)  Extension of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use may be expanded by the zoning board of adjustment in accordance with the following:

(2)  No structural alteration may be made on or in the building except those required by law to preserve such building in a structurally sound condition. 
(3)  The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling units or rooms existing at the time said use became a nonconforming use. 
(4)  No nonconforming use within a structure may be extended to occupy any land outside the structure. 
(5)  No nonconforming use of land or structure shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the land became a nonconforming use, except to provide off-street loading or off-street parking space. 
(f)  Restoration of nonconforming structure. 
(1)  If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire, the elements, or other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this chapter. In the case of partial destruction of a nonconforming use structure not exceeding 60 percent of its total appraised value as determined by the Brazos County Central Appraisal District, reconstruction will be permitted, but the existing square footage or function of the nonconforming use cannot be expanded. 
(2)  If a structure is nonconforming but the use is conforming to the respective zoning district and the structure is completely destroyed, the structure shall be rebuilt to conform to the provisions of the zoning district wherein it is located. 
(3)  A structure housing a nonconforming use may be remodeled as long as the size (square footage) of the structure is not increased. 
(g)  Completion of structures. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use of:

(3)  provided, however that such building permit shall comply with all applicable ordinances of the city in effect on the date such application was filed and the building permit is issued within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations. 
(h)  Licensed mobile home parks. Mobile home parks licensed according to chapter 74, prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be allowed to continue as long as the site area and number of units approved in said license is not exceeded. Lapse of said license shall be considered as abandonment of the nonconforming use.

Sec. 130-41. - Zoning board of adjustment. 
(a)  Creation. There is created a board known as the zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) of the city. 
(b)  Members and terms of office. The zoning board of adjustment shall consist of 5 regular members and 2 alternate members who shall be appointed by the city council in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 211.008-211.011, as amended, to serve for 2 years staggered terms or until their successors are duly appointed. 
(c)  Appointment of members. The city council shall appoint members to the zoning board of adjustment as specified by the city council adopted policy on the board and commission appointments. 
(d)  Authority. The zoning board of adjustment shall have the authority, subject to the standards established in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 211.001-211.011, and those established herein, to exercise the following powers and perform the following duties: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter. 
(2)  To permit the reconstruction, extension, or enlargement of a building occupied by a nonconforming use or building, on the lot or tract occupied by such a building, in accordance with the standards in section 130-40, provided such activity does not prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
(3)  To authorize in specific cases a variance from the requirements of the zoning ordinance, subject to limitation set forth in the ordinance, if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice is done. 
(e)  Limitations on authority of zoning board of adjustment. 
(1)  The zoning board of adjustment may not grant a variance authorizing a use other than those permitted in the district for which the variance is sought. 
(2)  The zoning board of adjustment shall have no power to grant or modify conditional use permits authorized under section 130-33. 
(3)  The zoning board of adjustment shall have no power to grant a zoning amendment. In the event that a request for a zoning amendment is pending before the planning and zoning commission or the city council, the zoning board of adjustment shall neither hear nor grant any variances with respect to the subject property until final disposition of the zoning amendment. 
(4)  The zoning board of adjustment shall not grant a request for any variance to any parcel of property or portion thereof upon which a site plan, preliminary plat, or final plat, where required, has not been finally acted upon by both the planning and zoning commission and, where required, by the city council. 
(f)  Variances. 
(1)  The zoning board of adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement of the zoning ordinance, if it makes written findings that: 
a.  The requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of the property; 
b.  The hardship for which the variance is requested is owing to a special condition inherent in the property itself, such as restricted area, shape, topography or physical features; 
c.  The special condition is unique to this property and is not generally characteristic of other parcels of land in the area; and 
d.  Development under the variance does not: 
1.  Alter the character of the area adjacent to the property; 
2.  Impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with the city requirements; or 
3.  Impair the purposes of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(2)  A variance may not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reasons only, nor may a variance be granted to permit any person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this chapter to other parcels of land in districts with the same zoning classification. 
(3)  The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts justifying a variance. 
(g)  Procedures. 
(1)  Application and fee. An application for action, by the zoning board of adjustment, other than an appeal, shall be in writing using forms provided by the city and shall be accompanied by a fee established by the city to cover administrative processing costs. 
(2)  Notice and hearing. The zoning board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on each application for action or appeal.

Notice of a public hearing shall be provided to all property owners within 200 feet of the affected property ten days prior to the public hearing. 
(3)  Appeals. 
a.

b.  The appellant must file with the zoning board of adjustment and the official from whom the appeal is taken a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal within 15 days after the decision has been rendered as determined by the rules of the zoning board of adjustment. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of adjustment all papers constituting the record of the action that is appealed. 
c.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the zoning board of adjustment facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the zoning board of adjustment or a court of record on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown. 
d.  The appellant party may appear at the appeal hearing in person or by agent or attorney. 
e.  The zoning board of adjustment shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time. The zoning board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken, and make the correct order, requirement, decision, or determination and for such purpose the zoning board of adjustment has the same authority as the official. 
(4)  Vote required for zoning board of adjustment decisions. The concurring vote of four members of the zoning board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of an administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under these zoning regulations, or to effect any variance to the zoning regulations granted by the zoning board of adjustment. 
(5)  Judicial review.

Such petition must be presented within ten days after the date the decision is filed in the zoning board of adjustment's office. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 130-42. - Changes and amendments to zoning ordinance, districts and administrative procedures. 
(a)  Declaration of policy. The city declares the enactment of these regulations governing the use and development of land, buildings, and structures as a measure necessary to the orderly development of the community. Therefore, no change shall be made in these regulations or in the boundaries of the zoning districts except: 
(1)  To correct any error in the regulations or map; 
(2)  To recognize changed or changing conditions or circumstances in a particular locality or area; 
(3)  To recognize changes in technology, the style of living, or manner of conducting business. 
(b)  Authority to amend the zoning ordinance. The city council may from time-to-time, after receiving a final report thereon by the planning and zoning commission and after public hearings required by law, amend, supplement, or change the regulations herein provided or the boundaries of the zoning districts. Any ordinance may be ordered for consideration by the city council, be initiated by the planning and zoning commission, or be requested by the owner of real property, or the authorized representative of an owner of real property. In no case shall the city council act upon any zoning request prior to action by the planning and zoning commission. Consideration for a change in any district boundary line or specific zoning regulation may be initiated only with written consent of the property owner, or by the planning and zoning commission or the city council on its own motion when it finds that public benefit will be derived from consideration of such matter. In the event the ownership stated on an application and that shown on the city records are different, the applicant shall submit proof of ownership. 
(c)  Residential neighborhood conservation district rezoning. 
(1)  Property owners may make application to the city council for a city initiated rezoning of an entire platted residential subdivision or a single phase/section of a platted residential subdivision or a historic preservation overlay district (HP) presently zoned residential district-7000 (RD-7) or residential district-5000 (RD-5) or south college - residential district (SC-R) to residential - neighborhood conservation district (R-NC). 
(2)  An application for a city initiated rezoning of an entire platted residential subdivision or a single phase/section of a platted residential subdivision or a historic preservation overlay district (HP) from residential district-7000 (RD-7000) or residential district-5000 (RD-5000) or south college - residential district (SC-R) to a residential - neighborhood conservation district (R-NC) must include the residential - neighborhood conservation district rezoning petition verification response form. This petition must be sent via regular mail to 100 percent of the lot of record owners listed within Brazos County Appraisal District Tax Rolls. All returned petition verification response forms shall contain signatures that shall be notarized, regardless of whether the vote cast is a yes or no. No signature affixed to the petition more than 270 days prior to the date of filing the petition with the city secretary shall be counted. Each lot of record shall have one vote regardless of the number of owners listed in the Brazos County Appraisal District Tax Rolls. The agent representing the platted subdivision or platted phase of a subdivision or a historic preservation overlay district (HP) shall file a notarized affidavit to attest all petition verification response forms were mailed to the last known owner(s) as listed in the Brazos County Appraisal District Tax Rolls. The residential - neighborhood conservation District rezoning petition verification response form and affidavit form may be obtained at the planning and development services department. 
(3)  At least 51 percent of the land area in the proposed residential - neighborhood conservation district must be presently improved as identified by the Brazos County Appraisal District (BCAD), and an affirmative vote of the owners of at least 58 percent of the lots of record within the platted subdivision or within a single phase/section of a platted subdivision or a historic preservation overlay district (HP) shall be required for the planning and zoning commission to take up consideration of the proposed rezoning. 
(4)  The completed rezoning application and petition verification response forms shall be submitted to the city secretary. The city secretary shall examine the rezoning application and ascertain whether it is sufficient under section 130-42(c)(2) and section 130-42(c)(3) and shall attach to the petition verification response forms the city secretary's certificate showing the result of the examination. If the certificate shows the rezoning application is insufficient, the rezoning application may be amended within ten days from the date of the certificate, after which time the city secretary shall examine the amended rezoning application. If the city secretary's certificate shows the amended rezoning application to be insufficient, it shall be returned to the person filing and a new petition for the same subdivision or phase/section shall not be submitted for a period of 180 days. If the rezoning application is found to be sufficient, the city secretary shall submit the rezoning application to planning and zoning commission without delay. 
(5)  If rezoned to a residential - neighborhood conservation district, the permitted uses of the property shall be determined and controlled by the use regulations set forth for in section 130-31. 
(d)  Application for zoning or amendment. Each application for zoning or for an amendment or change to the existing provisions of this chapter shall be made in writing on a form suitable to the planning and development services department and shall be filed with the city and shall be accompanied by payment of the appropriate fee to be charged by the city for administering the zoning application. 
(e)  Public hearing prior to making report. Prior to making its report to the city council regarding a proposed zoning change, the planning and zoning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on each application. Written notice of all public hearings on proposed changes in district boundaries shall be sent to all owners of property, or to the person rendering the same for city taxes, located within the area of application and within 200 feet of any property affected thereby, within not less than ten days before such hearing is held. Such notice may be served by using the last known address as listed on the latest approved tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. Although a public hearing must be held by the commission to consider amendments to the text of this chapter which do not change zoning district boundaries, published notice or written notification to individual property owners is not required prior to such hearing. 
(f)  Failure to appear. Failure of the applicant or his or her representative to appear before the planning and zoning commission or the city council for more than one hearing without an approved delay shall constitute sufficient grounds for the planning and zoning commission or the city council to terminate or deny the application. 
(g)  Commission consideration and report. The planning and zoning commission, after a public hearing is held to receive input from interested parties and closed, shall prepare its report and recommendations on the proposed change stating its findings, and evaluation. The planning and zoning commission may defer its report for not more than 90 days from the time it is posted on the agenda until it has had opportunity to consider any other proposed changes which may have a direct bearing thereon. In making its determination, the planning and zoning commission shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change will be appropriate in the immediate area concerned and their relationship to the general area and the city as a whole. 
(2)  Whether there is availability of water, wastewater, storm water, and transportation facilities generally suitable and adequate for the proposed use. 
(3)  The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances which may make a substantial part of such vacant land unavailable for development. 
(4)  The recent rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning classification as the request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed change. 
(5)  How other areas designated for similar development will be, or are unlikely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved, and whether such designation for other areas should be modified also. 
(6)  Any other factors which will substantially affect the health, safety, morals, or general welfare. 
(h)  Reasons for denial. If the planning and zoning commission or the city council deny a zoning request, it shall offer reasons to the applicant for the denial. The city council shall not hold a public hearing until it receives a final report and action from the planning and zoning commission unless a joint public hearing is held. 
(i)  City council consideration. 
(1)  Proposal recommended for approval by the commission. Every proposal which is recommended for approval by the planning and zoning commission shall be automatically forwarded to the city council for setting and holding of public hearing thereon. No change, however, shall become effective until after the adoption of an ordinance for same and its publication as required by law. 
(2)  Proposal recommended for denial by the commission. Planning and zoning commission determines that a proposal should be denied, it shall so report and recommend to the city council and notify the applicant. If the commission recommends denial, the request shall not be forwarded to the city council unless the applicant so requests or the request is sent for review by the commission by simple majority vote. A request which has received a recommendation for denial from the planning and zoning commission or has been denied by the city council may be resubmitted at any time for reconsideration by the city (a new filing fee must accompany the request). The city council may deny any request with prejudice. If a request has been denied with prejudice, the same or similar request may not be resubmitted to the city for six months from the original date of denial. 
(3)  City council hearing and notice. Notice of the city council hearing shall be given in the official newspaper of the city, stating the time and place of such hearing, at least 15 days prior to the date of public hearing. 
(4)  Three-fourths vote. In the event a protest to a proposed change to a zoning regulation or district boundary is filed with the city secretary, duly signed and acknowledged, by the owners of either: 
a.  Twenty percent or more of the area of the lots or land covered by the proposed change; or 
b.  By 20 percent or more of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed change and extending 200 feet from such area, such amendments shall not become effective except by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the city council. 
Note: In computing the percentage of land area under this subsection, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. In measuring the distance under section 130-42(i)(4)b, for lots opposite the subject property, the distance shall run from the street frontage of such opposite lots. 
(j)  Final approval and ordinance adoption. Upon approval of the zoning request by the city council, the applicant shall submit a metes and bounds description of each zoning district to the city within 30 days for the preparation of the amending ordinance. The amending ordinance shall be approved within six months. If the amending ordinance is not approved within six months, the zoning request, at the option of the city council may be recalled for a new public hearing. The zoning change shall not be effective and official until the amending ordinance is signed by the mayor and the city secretary under authority of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015; Ord. No. 2224 , § 2, 8-8-2017; Ord. No. 2268 , § 2, 4-10-2018)

(b)  Procedure for new or altered buildings. Written application for a certificate of occupancy for a new building or for an existing building which is to be altered shall be made at the same time as the application for the building permit for such building. The certificate of occupancy shall be issued within ten days after a written request for the same has been made to the chief building official or his or her agent after the erection or alteration of such building or part thereof has been completed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  Procedure for vacant land or a change in building use. Written application for a certificate of occupancy for the use of vacant land, or for a change in the use of land or a building, or for a change in a nonconforming use to a conforming use, as herein provided, application for certificate of occupancy shall be made to the chief building official for review on forms available in the chief building inspector's office. If the proposed use is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued within ten days after the application for same has been made. 
(d)  Contents. Every certificate of occupancy shall state that the building or the proposed use of a building or land complies with all provision of the building and fire laws and ordinances. A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the office of the chief building official or his or her agent and copies shall be furnished upon request to any person having proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected. 
(e)  Temporary certificate. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the chief building official for a period not exceeding six months, during the completion of alterations or during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. Such temporary certificates shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective rights, duties, or obligations of the owners or of the city relating to the use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by this chapter. 
(f)  Nonconforming uses. A record shall be required for all nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.

No certificate of occupancy shall be granted for any property designated on this map until such use is reviewed and approved in accordance with section 130-40. 
(Ord. No. 2110 , § 3, 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 130-44. - Preserving rights in pending litigation and violations under other existing ordinances. 
    By the passage of this chapter, no presently illegal use shall be deemed to have been legalized unless specifically such use falls within a use district where the actual use is a conforming use. Otherwise, such uses shall remain nonconforming uses where recognized. It is further the intent and declared purpose of this chapter that no offense committed, and no liability, penalty, or forfeiture, either civil or criminal, incurred prior to the time this zoning ordinance was enacted and adopted, shall be discharged or affected by such repeal; but prosecutions and suits for such offenses, liabilities, penalties, or forfeitures may be instituted or causes presently pending proceeded with in all respects as if such prior ordinance had not been repealed.
