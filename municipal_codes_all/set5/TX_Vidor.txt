PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Vidor, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Norma Smith, former City Secretary, Mr. Guy Goodson, City Attorney, and other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 10-271. - "Dangerous structure" defined. 
(a)  Generally. All vacant structures, dwellings, dwelling units and accessory structures which have any or all of the following defects shall be deemed dangerous structures: 
(1)  All vacant buildings or structures whose walls or other vertical structural members list, lean or buckle in excess of three-fourths inch of horizontal measurement for each foot of vertical measurement. 
(2)  All vacant buildings or structures which show 33 percent or more damage or deterioration of the supporting members, or 50 percent or more damage or deterioration of the non-supporting or outside walls or coverings. 
(3)  All vacant buildings or structures which have parts thereof which are so attached that they may fall or injure members of the public or property. 
(4)  All vacant buildings and structures which, by reason of dilapidated or deteriorated conditions, have unsafe or defective electrical wiring devices or equipment, unsafe or defective gas piping, or appliances which are liable to cause or promote fires. 
(5)  All vacant buildings and structures which have been damaged by fire, explosion, wind, vandalism or elements of nature so as to have become dangerous to the life, safety or the general health and welfare of the occupants thereof or inhabitants of the city. 
(6)  Those vacant structures which have become so dilapidated, decayed, unsafe, unsanitary or which utterly fail to provide amenities essential to decent living such that they are unfit for human habitation or likely to cause sickness or disease so as to work injury to the health, safety or general welfare of those living thereabout. 
(7)  Those buildings and structures existing in violation of any provision of the building code of the city or any provision of the city fire code or other ordinances of the city, to such an extent that they are dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  Substandard dwellings suitable for rehabilitation. Substandard dwelling suitable for rehabilitation means dwellings which in the opinion of the code enforcement officer or his duly appointed representative can be brought into compliance with the provisions of this article at a total cost of no more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the dwelling. 
(1)  Criteria for determination of suitability. If, in the opinion of the code enforcement officer, rehabilitation of the structure shall be more than 50 percent of fair market value of the dwelling, rehabilitation shall not be permitted. It is the opinion of the city that such expenditures will take lease and rent rates out of the low to moderate income range. Also, in determining suitability for rehabilitation, the 25 percent to 50 percent rule shall come into play: (i) when the rehabilitation of the dwelling is 25 percent or less of the total structure, the rehabilitation can be performed to the level of the codes in place at the time of original construction; or (ii) if the rehabilitation will affect 25 percent to 50 percent of the total dwelling, the rehabilitation shall comply with all codes in place to date. It is the city's opinion that the 25 percent to 50 percent rule is necessary to insure the health, safety and welfare of tenants of rehabilitated properties. 
(2)  Exception to criteria for suitability. In the case of an owner-occupied substandard dwelling, the 25 percent to 50 percent rule shall not apply. The 50 percent fair market value may be exceeded upon request of the code enforcement officer. 
(c)  Appeals. If an owner of a substandard dwelling wishes to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer on the suitability for rehabilitation ruling, he may do so by the following procedure: 
(1)  Present the code enforcement officer with appraisal of the property by a licensed real estate appraiser. 
(2)  Present the code enforcement officer with signed estimates for work to be done by licensed and bonded contractors for the full cost of the rehabilitation. 
The following is an exception to subsection (c)(2) of this section: For owners of substandard dwelling who are going to live in the rehabilitated dwelling, the code enforcement officer will consider the owner's written estimates for rehabilitation.

(3)  If a structure is to be repaired such that it is no longer a dangerous structure under the terms of this division, the structure shall be brought into compliance with the provisions of the current housing code adopted by the city. Repairs to such structures shall be completed within a period not exceeding 120 days from the date of initiating a work program. Failure to comply with the provisions within such 120-day period or any extension approved by the city council may be brought before the city council for a condemnation order without further notice to the owner. An owner who initiates a work program under this subsection shall agree that unless the structure is brought into compliance with the city's current housing code it may be immediately brought before the city council for a condemnation order without further notice. 
(4)  Any vacant structure found to be a dangerous structure as defined in this division or substandard under section 10-271 shall be posted to prevent occupancy. It shall be unlawful for any person to occupy a structure that has been tagged as a dangerous structure in accordance with this section. 
(5)  All notices as provided in this division shall be served by delivering the notice to the owner or agent in person, or by mailing the notice certified to the residence or business address, if known, of such owner or agent, or by posting the notice in a prominent place upon such building or structure.

Such owner or agent shall forthwith comply with the order of the city council, and any owner or agent of such building or structure failing to comply with such order within the time therein stipulated shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as provided in this Code. If the owner obtains a permit and voluntarily demolishes his structure under this program, such owner shall be responsible for the payment of the landfill disposal fee for the debris resulting from such demolition. 
(7)  If any such building or structure condemned by the order of the city council, as provided in this division, is not razed, removed or repaired within the time and under the conditions specified in such order, the city council may, at its discretion, proceed to have the building or structure razed and charge the actual expense to the owner of the real estate or lot as shown on the tax roll.

The statement of expenses shall, in addition to giving the amount of such expense, provide the date upon which such work was done, and a description of the lot or premises upon which such work was done. Payment is due and is considered delinquent if not received by the city within 30 days. If payment is not made within 90 days, the city's authorized agent is hereby authorized to charge such costs and expenses as a special tax to the property upon which such building or structure is situated, and upon all other property situated in the city belonging to the owner of such building or structure.

(a)  Purpose. An owner or person in control of an unoccupied building shall insure that the building is in such condition that an unauthorized person cannot enter into it through missing or unlocked doors or windows or through other openings into the building. The city may secure unoccupied, unsecured structures after the owner fails to do so after reasonable notice. A lien may be filed on the structures to assure recovery of the cost of securing. 
(b)  Definition. An unsecured unoccupied building is hereby defined to be any structure that currently has no legitimate occupant or tenant and which has missing or unlocked doors or windows or other unsecured openings into the building through which unauthorized persons can enter. Any unoccupied unsecured building is hereby declared to be a danger to the public health and safety. 
(c)  Notice. Whenever it is found that an unoccupied building is in such condition that an unauthorized person can enter it through missing or unlocked doors or windows or other openings, the city shall cause a written notice or "Notice to Secure" to be given to the owner of the property as such owner appears on the tax rolls of the city or to the person having the control over the property. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given by depositing the notice in the United States mail addressed to the owner at the owner's post office address. If personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown, notice may be given by publishing such notice at least twice within a ten-day period in the newspaper of general circulation in the city. If personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown, notice may be obtained by posting the notice on or near the front door of the building. The notice must contain the following information:

(2)  The description of the violations of the municipal standards that are present at the building; 
(3)  A statement that the city may secure the building within 30 days of the date of notice; and 
(4)  An explanation that the owner is entitled to request a hearing within such 30-day period concerning any matter relating to the city's proposed securing of the building. 
(d)  Compliance with other requirements. Compliance with the provisions concerning the securing of unoccupied structures does not relieve the owner or occupant of the structure from the requirement to comply with other provisions of this article. 
(e)  Appeals. If the owner requests a hearing about the structure, the city shall set a hearing, at which time the owner may testify or present witnesses or written information about any matter relating to the proposed securing of the building by the city. The hearing shall be set within 20 days after the day the owner files a written request for such hearing. The hearing shall be before the city council unless delegated to the city manager by the city council. 
(f)  Penalty. An owner who fails to timely comply with a notice to secure as set out in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $2,000.00. Each day's failure to comply after the expiration of the notice period shall constitute a separate offense. 
(g)  Securing by city. If the owner fails to comply with a notice to secure, the city may order the boarding up of all openings so as to prevent entry or the reasonable securing of the structure by any other reasonable fashion and may assess the expenses of such securing as a lien on the property as allowed by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 214.0011(f).

ARTICLE IX. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[9] 
Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
State Law reference- Authority to adopt, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 243.001 et seq. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 14-351. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(Ord. No. 943, § A, 2-17-2000) 
Sec. 14-352. - Findings. 
    Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings, meetings and reports made available to the council and on studies in other communities, including, but not limited to, Beaumont, Texas; Jefferson County, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Cleveland, Ohio, the council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses may lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that presently are sometimes uncontrolled by the managers of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for certain activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, may easily occur at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which may create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Many communicable diseases may be spread by activities which may occur in sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(7)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (6) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(8)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(9)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the managers of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the managers to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual manager of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(10)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity which may occur in such booths. 
(11)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(12)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, may aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(13)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(14)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business or sexually oriented business employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(15)  The barring of such individuals from the management of or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(16)  The general welfare, health, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses can exert dehumanizing influences on churches, schools and day care centers, and have negative effects on property values, can contribute to increased criminal activities in surrounding areas, and can exert the same types of negative community influences on other forms of land usage such as parks and nonprofit organizations that provide recreational facilities for public use. 
(18)  The offenses listed under specified criminal activity which may serve as grounds for denial, revocation or refusal of a license under this article are offenses which relate to or bear on the management or operation of a sexually oriented business or employment in a sexually oriented business. The specified criminal activity offenses would also be directly related to the fitness of an individual to receive a license as a sexually oriented business employee. Accordingly, the specified criminal activity offenses are directly related to the duties and the responsibilities which may be authorized by a license issued under this article. Accordingly, there is a serious need to protect members of the public and fellow employees of sexually oriented business enterprises from persons who have committed the specified criminal activity offenses outlined in this article. 
(19)  Persons who hold or apply for sexually oriented business or business employee licenses under this article should be subject to a verification that they have not been convicted of any of the offenses noted under the definition for specified criminal activity. 
(20)  Booths associated with casual sexual activity may facilitate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, criminal activities including lewd conduct, indecent exposure, etc., or other activities detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the public and there is a need to provide for the monitoring of activities in facilities which offer either live entertainment or films, movies, videocassettes, video reproductions, video laser disks, slides, or other visual representations which are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas and therefore require that areas where such activities occur be fully visible to and monitored by management employees of such sexually oriented businesses to ensure that the provisions of this article are complied with. 
(21)  Distance requirements as they address the location of sexually oriented businesses or the conduct of licensed employees are reasonable and necessary to provide protection to the community from the adverse effects of sexually oriented business and may be done without depriving such businesses of adequate opportunities to locate within the city or licensed employees from engaging in protected activities. 
(22)  The city council finds that the provisions of this article as they relate to signage requirements are proper subjects for council control and that the failure to control signage related to sexually oriented businesses may have a negative community effect, that the institution of the signage requirements would serve to reduce the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses upon the community, that the signage requirements would not deprive such businesses of adequate opportunity to provide notice to the public of their location and business, and that the requirement would further act to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

ARTICLE II. - EMERGENCY AND NONEMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES 

Sec. 21-31. - Scope. 
    This article will govern and apply to the operation of ambulance service, ambulances and related medical services personnel within the city. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008) 
Sec. 21-32. - Statutory authority. 
    This chapter is enacted by the city council of Vidor, Texas, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Texas Health and Safety Code § 773.051, which provides that municipalities may establish standards for ambulances, and to V.T.C.A., Texas Government Code § 791.001, which provides that combinations of local governmental units may contract for the provision of governmental services. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008) 
Sec. 21-33. - General purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of this article: 
(a)  To establish a regulated ambulance service system that can provide state-of-the-art clinical quality of care, with reasonable, reliable response time standards, and with the goal of furnishing each ambulance patient with the best possible chance of survival, without disability or preventable complication. This system will be established for the city or in conjunction with the execution of an interlocal agreement for an area including the geographic area governed by all governmental entities that are parties to any such agreement; 
(b)  Through the adoption of this article, it is intended that a privately-operated ambulance service providing patient transportation service and emergency medical services be competitively selected and regulated as a provider of emergency and nonemergency ambulance service for the following reasons: 
(1)  The provision of consistent high quality emergency and nonemergency ambulance service and any and all aspects attendant to emergency and nonemergency operations, provided by qualified personnel with advanced life support equipment, is essential to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city; 
(2)  It is unreasonable to have unnecessarily high rates and/or public subsidy to make needed improvements to ambulance service in the city when a more efficient system design could achieve the same results; 
(3)  The most efficient design to achieve the goals of high-quality service, at the lowest cost consistent with such quality, and performance security in the event of contractor default, is the implementation of privately-operated, permitted emergency medical services to the 911 or other emergency communication dispatch within the city, which is essential to maintaining rapid response times and to ensuring the stability and access to ambulance service for a set term; 
(4)  The type of competition that will benefit the consumer of ambulance services is regular competition through an application process for the market rather than street-level competition; 
(5)  More effective system performance will be achieved through one or more permitted, qualified private operators rather than through governmental operation of ambulance services; and 
(6)  The regulation of such privately-owned and operated ambulance service is an essential governmental function, as the city may protect the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens by permitting, controlling and regulating by ordinance privately-operated ambulance services, the furnishing of emergency medical services, and any and all aspects attendant to ambulance operations within the jurisdiction of the city, including through its designees or assignees under an applicable interlocal agreement, depending on public convenience and necessity as determined pursuant to this article.

(c)  Any renewed permit will commence at the beginning of each calendar year and continue until the end of such calendar year, unless sooner terminated as provided in this article or in the contract between the EMS provider and the city, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement.

Sec. 21-51. - Performance security. 
    An applicant must establish performance security valued at $250,000.00. The performance security may be fulfilled by any one of the following or combination thereof, as determined by city, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, in its sole reasonable discretion: letter of credit, bond, escrowed assets, corporate guaranty, note or other assurances. Said performance security will be forfeited for any of the following conditions:

(2)  Failure to correct a material breach of the terms and conditions of this chapter or of the contract within a ten-day period, after receiving written notice of same. A material breach is one that is one of urgent public necessity (i.e., applicant's permit permitting it to conduct its business has been fully and finally adjudicated revoked by the TDSHS, failing to provide the proper number of or properly operating units, failing to provide liability insurance, engaging in discriminatory practices, any unsafe or illegal activity that might affect the citizens of the city). 
The purpose of this performance security is to recover costs to the city, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, for accepting and administering applications for an EMS provider permit in the event the permit is revoked.

(a)  The EMS provider, as a condition of the issuance of a permit under this article, agrees to assume all risks incident to or in connection with the EMS provider's operation of an ambulance service system within the service area and agrees to be solely responsible for all accidents, injuries or damages of whatever nature to persons or property caused by or resulting from the EMS provider's operation. 
(b)  Independent of the requirement to provide insurance, each EMS provider must indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city, its officers, agents and employees, and the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, from and against liability for any and all claims, liens, suits, demands, and/or actions for damages, injuries to persons (including death), property damage (including loss of use), and expenses, including court costs and attorney's fees and other reasonable costs arising out of the EMS provider's work and/or activities conducted in connection with this article, including all causes of action based upon common, constitutional, or statutory law, or based in whole or in part upon the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the EMS provider, its officers, agents, employees, subcontractors, licensees, and invitees.

Sec. 21-56. - Inspections. 
(a)  Prior to the initial use and operation of any vehicle as an ambulance, the vehicle and the premises from which it is to be operated must be thoroughly examined and inspected by the city manager or his designee, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, in order to determine compliance with the requirements of V.T.C.A., Texas Health and Safety Code, chapter 773, and the provisions stated in this article. 
(b)  In addition, every ambulance operating in the service area will be made available to the city manager or his designee, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, for inspection upon request. The EMS provider will be notified of the unit or units to be inspected, and the unit must be brought to the city's main fire department, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, for inspection before 5:00 p.m. on the day of the request, although there will be only one ambulance at the fire station, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, being inspected at a time. 
(c)  Every ambulance operated by a permitted EMS provider may also be spot inspected at any time by the city manager or his designee, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement. The EMS vehicle will not be kept out of service for any length of time and will be returned to service immediately if the ambulance is needed. However, if the ambulance is unsafe or found to be out of compliance with this article or any federal or state laws, the ambulance permit will be suspended immediately. 
(d)  If there is reason to believe an ambulance is in violation of state or local rules or regulations, the city manager or his designee, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, may suspend the ambulance permit. The ambulance will not be allowed to return to service until it has been inspected and meets all state and local rules and regulations. 
(e)  When inspecting an ambulance, it will be taken into consideration that the ambulance has been in service and reasonable usage of supplies will have occurred. No ambulance will respond to calls of any nature, emergency or transport, within the service area if the supplies are below the EMS provider's protocols minimum. 
(f)  An ambulance permit may be suspended at any time an ambulance fails an inspection. This may not then be used as a reason for poor response times. It is the EMS provider's responsibility to maintain the ambulances, equipment, and supplies as set forth by the state, this article, and the EMS provider's protocols. 
(g)  Any EMS vehicle that has had its ambulance permit suspended will not be allowed to operate in the service area until the ambulance has passed reinspection. When the ambulance has met all requirements of this article and all applicable state laws, the ambulance permit will be reinstated and the ambulance may return to service. 
(h)  A record of all revoked or suspended ambulance and/or provider's permits, and any incident reports will be kept in the EMS provider's file. This information will be used when considering the renewal of an EMS providers permit and for assessing penalties or fines.

(b)  Every ambulance, when responding to emergency calls, must be staffed with at least two attendants, one of whom must be the holder of a current EMT-P certification or licensure and the other the holder of at least a current EMT certificate, both issued by the TDSHS. The following exceptions may be granted: 
(1)  A permitted ALS ambulance that first responds to an emergency call to provide immediate medical care until the arrival of an EMT-P; 
(2)  An ambulance that is responding to a medical emergency that is providing manpower, additional supplies, or equipment. This vehicle however cannot transport any sick or injured persons unless it is a permitted ambulance that meets minimum requirements of this article; 
(3)  Any emergency or nonemergency vehicle that is needed to transport patients with minor or no injuries during an mass casualty incident. 
(c)  Every BLS ambulance permitted under this article, when transporting patients must be staffed with at least two attendants and each attendant must, at a minimum, be an EMT. Every ALS ambulance permitted under this article, when transporting patients, must be staffed with at least two attendants, one of whom must, at a minimum, be an EMT and the other of whom must be an EMT-I or an EMT-P, provided, however, that an EMT-P must nevertheless be part of a response by the EMS provider to any emergency calls as set forth in subsection (b) above, whether as part of an ALS ambulance or separate EMS vehicle, in order to make further determinations at a medical scene as provided in section [21-59](d). 
(d)  Any person serving as a transfer ambulance attendant within the city limits must be currently certified by the TDSHS as an EMT. 
(e)  A listing of all certified personnel including name and level of certification, together with current photostatic copies of state certification for each attendant, must be filed and maintained by each EMS provider with the city secretary, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, updating the list as necessary, but no less than quarterly.

    All of the EMS provider's management and supervisory personnel must be easily identified as to rank, title, and/or certification level when on an emergency scene. Any EMS provider personnel other than emergency medical in nature, such as mechanics, students, or dispatchers must also be clearly and easily identified as to their job designation or title while on an emergency scene. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008) 
Sec. 21-59. - Rotation system; emergency operations; incident command. 
(a)  If more than one EMS provider holds a valid permit issued by the city, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, under this article, such EMS providers must operate on a weekly rotation basis for emergency medical calls received through the 911 system. The method of rotation will be from 7:00 a.m. Sunday to 7:00 a.m. Sunday of the following week, and each EMS provider permitted hereunder will in turn be assigned a one-week shift to respond to such calls. When each ambulance company has served a one-week shift, the rotation will start over. 
(b)  The county emergency services district no. 1 serves as the public safety answering point (PSAP) for 911 calls initiated in the city response area. The county emergency services district no. 1 PSAP will transfer the call to the EMS provider whose shift it is in the rotation to respond to emergency calls, unless the caller requests a specific EMS provider that holds a current EMS provider's permit, in which case the requested EMS provider will be notified of the call regardless of the rotation. Except as otherwise provided, each EMS provider permitted hereunder must respond to all 911 calls referred by the fire department during the EMS provider's shift on the rotation and will provide adequate ambulances, dispatch facilities and staffing to respond to such calls. The EMS provider then acting will be required to respond to all calls in accordance with the terms of the contract required by this article. Violation of this provision may subject the EMS provider to revocation of its permit hereunder. 
(c)  Orange county emergency services district no. 1 may monitor any emergency call to initiate dispatch of medical first responders. In the event an EMS provider receives a transferred 911 or emergency private call and is unable to respond immediately, the EMS provider will be responsible for immediately forwarding the call to another provider that has a mutual aid agreement with the primary provider. 
(d)  The EMS provider's senior paramedic on a medical scene will determine if the patient requires ALS care (EMT-I) or MICU care (EMT-P) for the transport of a patient to an emergency medical facility. This will be the sole responsibility of the EMS Provider's senior paramedic and reflect the company's medical director's guidelines via standing protocols or online medical direction. At no time may the senior paramedic or other EMS personnel delay the transport of sick or injured patients stable or unstable to allow for another ambulance to transport. 
(e)  The incident command system will be used on all incidents. The incident commander will be the highest rank firefighter, or police officer on scene. All emergency medical, fire, police, and public safety personnel will report to the incident commander or his/her designee for accountability. At no time will any emergency response personnel enter the scene without notifying the incident commander or his/her designee of their presence. 
(f)  The EMS provider that initially responds to a large incident will provide a liaison (medical officer) to the incident commander to assist with coordinating EMS response and transport. 
(g)  The medical officer will not be involved with direct patient care and will be available to the incident commander at all times. 
(h)  The medical officer will be responsible for accountability of EMS personnel, number of patients, types of transportation needed, and the status of local emergency medical facilities. The medical officer may delegate responsibilities to other EMS staff on scene, but will remain responsible to the incident commander for EMS operations for that incident. 
(i)  EMS providers may be requested to respond, at minimum, an ALS ambulance to all known structure fires or incidents that could be hazardous to life or health. County emergency services district no. 1 will notify the EMS provider the location, type, and any known response hazards that may exist at the scene of the stand-by. 
(j)  Ambulances that respond to a scene designated as a stand-by, should stage in an area that would enable the EMS personnel to render speedy medical attention and transport if needed. These ambulances must not stage in any area that would prevent transporting immediately from the scene or interfere with emergency operations. The incident commander will have final authority of all staged vehicles and personnel. 
(k)  If the EMS provider is unable to respond to a stand-by, the incident commander must be notified via county emergency services district no. 1. The EMS provider must make every effort to supply an ambulance in an expedient manner. 
(l)  EMS providers that respond to a stand-by may at any time request the ambulance be returned to service when it is deemed necessary by the EMS provider. This request must be made to the incident commander. 
(m)  EMS vehicles responding to emergency calls within the city response area must be operated in accordance with state traffic laws pertaining to emergency vehicles as outlined in V.T.C.A., Texas Transportation Code, Ch. 546, as currently defined and subsequently amended, and in accordance with the specific provisions of this article. The EMS provider must ensure all employees know and understand these traffic laws. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008; Ord. No. 1233, § 1, 9-10-2015) 
Sec. 21-60. - Transport of injured or ill persons; operation of ambulance service. 
(a)  Ambulances will be required to transfer patients in a prompt and safe manner. The driver or operator of any ambulance or other response unit or auxiliary vehicle of an EMS provider permitted hereunder must comply with all of the state traffic laws and city ordinances, including this article, in operating an ambulance, whether emergency medical services or for nonemergency transfer, or in operating any auxiliary vehicle or other response unit as part of a call. 
(b)  It will be unlawful to operate or drive an ambulance or other response unit or auxiliary vehicle of an EMS provider permitted hereunder on emergency call on the public streets of the city at a rate of speed of more than ten miles per hour in excess of the legal speed limit. It will be unlawful to operate or drive an ambulance or other response unit or auxiliary vehicle of an EMS provider permitted hereunder on an emergency call in excess of ten miles per hour while entering and passing through an intersection if such intersection is controlled by a stop sign or by a traffic signal which indicates stop by displaying a red light. 
(c)  It will be unlawful for any person to operate an ambulance or other response unit or auxiliary vehicle of an EMS provider permitted hereunder on the streets of the city without a current, valid driver's license issued by the appropriate governing entity for transportation and public safety located in that person's then-current state of residence for the purpose of operating such vehicles. 
(d)  It will be unlawful for any EMS provider to refuse to render emergency medical service after responding to an emergency call for such service. 
(e)  An EMS provider must respond to all calls for ambulance service within the service area and may not refuse transport of any patient to any hospital within the service area; provided, however, that the EMS provider may promulgate reasonable procedures and regulations for dealing with the abuse or potential abuse of the system by any person and allow exceptions to this requirement in conformance therewith. 
(f)  An EMS provider permitted under this article must serve all parts of the service area in an equitable manner. In this regard, the EMS provider must furnish and manage its resources in such manner as to provide emergency and transfer ambulance service throughout the service area and must take any and all actions that are reasonably necessary to minimize any differences in response time performance among the various parts of the service area. The EMS provider must take all necessary steps to eliminate any continuing pattern of apparent discrimination in response time performance to any part of the service area. 
(g)  An EMS provider holding a permit hereunder must not deny timely emergency response, treatment, or transportation to an appropriate medical facility to anyone in the city due to age, sex, race, religion, ethnicity, medical condition or the patient's actual or perceived ability or inability to pay for services rendered pursuant to the permit. In addition, the holder of an emergency ambulance permit must make available to the city, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, upon the city's request, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, ambulances and personnel necessary for standby and assistance during emergencies occurring in the city. 
(h)  An EMS provider permitted under this article must prohibit its officers, agents, representatives, subcontractors, licensees, invitees and employees from responding to emergency calls or incidents in personal, privately-owned vehicles, regardless of whether such individuals are on duty or off duty in terms of their responsibilities with the EMS provider at the time. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008; Ord. No. 1233, § 1, 9-10-2015) 
Sec. 21-61. - Promptness of service; response times. 
(a)  An EMS provider must adhere to the response time obligations set forth in the contract for emergencies. The official time will begin when the EMS provider receives all information necessary to dispatch an ambulance to the scene and end when an ALS ambulance arrives on scene with MICU transport capabilities (paramedic on scene), as further provided in the contract. The requirements for such response times throughout the service area will be further outlined in the contract. However, if the call has been triaged by an emergency medical dispatcher and meets current EMD guidelines of a nonlifethreatening medical emergency, the call may be reclassified by the EMS provider's dispatch as a nonemergency call. 
(b)  All response times will be computed on a calendar month basis, and an EMS provider must make monthly reports to the city manager, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, indicating its total emergency responses in the service area, demonstrating its monthly compliance with the promptness requirement, and indicating its overall average response time for all emergency calls in the service area. 
(c)  The city manager or his designee, or the city's designees or assignees under any applicable interlocal agreement, will determine compliance with the response times in accordance with the contract. If a provider is found to be out of compliance with minimum response times specified in this article, the provider will be notified of the findings. The EMS provider will immediately take all steps necessary to remedy these problems, including but not limited to, increasing the number of in-service ambulances available. 
(d)  In determining whether a response to a call is exempt from the response time standard, the following factors will include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Any calls where information on medical need is not immediately available. (This situation exists when an ambulance is not originally dispatched after the PSAP receives the call, but is subsequently requested by on-scene police, fire, or public safety personnel). 
(2)  Ambulances that are unable to proceed due to an intersection blocked by a train or other unforeseeable traffic stoppages. (Ambulances will immediately notify their dispatch and city police department when a train blocks an ambulance and when the train is cleared and travel resumes.) 
(3)  Any severe weather conditions including dense fog, heavy rain or flooding, snow, or ice, except if inclement weather was predicted sufficiently in advance that levels of preparedness should have been increased and such steps were not taken. 
(4)  Any situations where the dispatch center received false or inaccurate information or was unable to obtain adequate response information. 
(5)  Calls for standby at fire service incidents. 
(6)  Calls for standby at law enforcement incidents. 
(7)  Excess runs that occur during periods of unusual system overload. Unusual system overload is defined as a period of time during which more than three emergency calls are simultaneously in progress within the geographical boundaries of the service area. Excess runs are those responses after the third emergency call during an unusual system overload. 
(8)  Any response after the first response in cases of multiple-response incidents (i.e., where more than one ambulance is sent to the same incident). 
(9)  Delayed response due to potentially hazardous scenes or in which access is restricted by public safety personnel. 
(Ord. No. 1085, § 1, 4-10-2008; Ord. No. 1233, § 1, 9-10-2015) 
Sec. 21-62. - Communications; dispatch. 
(a)  Every ambulance for which an ambulance permit has been issued must be equipped with a fully operational two-way radio communications system. Mobile or portable type radios may be used; however, there must be sufficient radios for each unit providing service to the service area.

    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area. See Area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 30-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of City of Vidor are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 1111, 7-9-2009) 
Sec. 30-33. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 1111, 7-9-2009) 
Sec. 30-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 30-64(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 30-33). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections 30-65(a)-(i) are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Secs. 30-66-30-90. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS 

Sec. 30-91. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(7)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 1111, 7-9-2009) 
Sec. 30-92. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 30-36, subsection 30-62(8), or subection 30-93(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new residential construction and substantial residential improvements should comply with all federal and state floodplain management regulations, requirements and standards as they relate to base flood elevation for new residential construction or substantial residential improvements. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors; however, this methodology is in addition to anchoring requirements specified in chapter 42, article II, sections 42-41 and 42-42 of this Code. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated 12 inches above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is 12 inches above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 30-64(a) of this article, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes". A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 30-94. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-36, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 12 inches above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in [subsection 30-64(a)] are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

(a)  If the facility is completed and begins producing a product or service, but subsequently discontinues producing a product or service for any reason excepting fire, explosion, or other casualty or accident or natural disaster, for a period of 12 consecutive months during the abatement period, then the agreement shall terminate and so shall the abatement of taxes for the calendar year during which the facility no longer produces. The taxes otherwise abated for that calendar year shall be paid to the city within 60 days from the date of termination. 
(b)  If, on January 1 of any tax year, the legally determined fair market value of all realty improvements owned by the real property owner within the jurisdiction of the governmental entity ("realty improvements") is less than the legally determined fair market value of all realty improvements as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the contract is executed ("base value"), then the abatement otherwise available shall be reduced for each dollar that the fair market value of realty improvements is less than the base value; provided, however, that in no event shall the offset exceed the created value of the project otherwise subject to the abatement of taxes. The assessed value of the real property shall be that value assigned by the Orange County Appraisal District. Furthermore, if the city loses tax revenue in any tax year during the term of the contract as a result of lowered assessed property valuation in the city as determined by the Orange County Appraisal District, the amount of tax dollars abated will be reduced during such tax year for each dollar of lost tax revenue; provided, however, that in no event shall the reduction exceed the amount of taxes that would otherwise be abated. 
(c)  Should the city determine that the company or individual is in default according to the terms and conditions of its agreement, the city shall notify the company or individual in writing at the address stated in the agreement, and if such is not cured within 60 days from the date of such notice ("cure period"), then the agreement may be terminated.

(1)  Allows its ad valorem taxes owed to the city to become delinquent and fails to timely and properly follow the legal procedures for their protest and/or contest; or 
(2)  Violates any of the terms and conditions of the abatement agreement and fails to cure during the cure period;

Each year, the company or individual receiving abatement shall furnish the assessor with such information as may be necessary for the abatement. Once value has been established, the chief appraiser shall notify the city of the amount of the assessment. 
(b)  The agreement shall stipulate that a designated representative of the city will have access to the reinvestment zone during the term of the abatement to inspect the facility to determine if the terms and conditions of the agreement are being met. All inspections will be made only after the giving of 24 hours' prior notice and will only be conducted in such manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the construction and/or operation of the facility. All inspections will be made with one or more representatives of the company or individual and in accordance with its safety standards. 
(c)  Upon completion of the construction, the city shall annually evaluate each facility receiving abatement to ensure compliance with the agreement.

(1)  County of Orange. 
(2)  Orange County Appraisal District. 
(3)  Orange County Drainage District. 
(4)  Orange County Navigation and Port District. 
(5)  City of Bridge City. 
(6)  City of Orange. 
(7)  City of Pinehurst. 
(8)  City of Rose City. 
(9)  City of Vidor. 
(10)  City of West Orange. 
(Ord. No. 893, § 1(11), 10-23-1997) 
Sec. 66-132. - Letter of understanding method used in calculating abatements. 
    In accordance with the county uniform tax abatement policy, a real property owner's current year taxable value, after abatement, should not be less than the "base year" taxable value, after abatement. 
(1)  Calculation of base year value. A property owner's "base year value," for each taxing entity executing an abatement contract, is the fair market value of all the owner's industrial realty improvements located within that entity for the tax period defined as the "base year," less the abated value of all projects granted by that entity for that year. 
(2)  Calculation of current year value. A property owner's "currant year value" for each taxing unit is the fair market value of all the owner's industrial realty improvements included in the "base year value." 
(3)  Calculation of value potentially "current year value." The following procedures are followed for each project for which a tax abatement contract has been executed and for each taxing entity granting the abatement: 
a.  The project base value, if applicable, is subtracted from the current year project value, and the percentage of abatement to be granted is then applied to the net amount to determine the project value subject to abatement. 
b.  The "base year value" is subtracted from the "current year value." If the difference is greater than zero, then the remaining is the value potentially eligible for abatement to the extent that it does not exceed the project value subject to abatement. If the difference is zero or less, then the project is not eligible for abatement for the tax year. 
(4)  Calculation of abated value. Each project that remains potentially eligible for abatement is then tested for each taxing entity granting the abatement on an individual basis in chronological order based on the date the contract was executed. 
a.  For the project being tested, the "base year value" plus the value potentially eligible for abatement for all other projects is subtracted from the "current year value." If the difference is greater than zero, then the remaining value is the value of the project to be abated to the extent that it does not exceed the project value subject to abatement for that year. If the difference is zero or less, then the project is not eligible for an abatement for that year. 
b.  If a subsequent project being tested is determined to be ineligible for the full value potentially eligible for abatement calculated by performing the calculations stated above, then the test process must be redone for all prior projects using the actual value subject to abatement for the subsequent project to determine if there is any affect on the abatement for each project and each taxing entity for that year.

Thereafter, it shall be the right of all subscribers to continuously receive all available services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the company are honored. In the event the company elects to rebuild or modify the system or, with the consent of the city, to sell or otherwise transfer the system, or in the event the franchise terminates, the company shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service. The company shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions of this section, nor shall suffer any enforcement or penalty related thereto, where such noncompliance or default is caused by strike, act of God, power outages, or other event reasonably beyond the ability of the company to control. In the event of an acquisition of the system by the city, or a sale or transfer of the system by the company, on its own initiative or at the direction of the city in accordance with section 16 [17] hereof, the company shall cooperate with the city to operate the system for a temporary period, in order to maintain continuity of service to subscribers.

The company is hereby authorized to extend the system as necessary, or desirable, or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within the cable service area. Whenever the company shall receive a request for service from at least ten subscribers within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its system to such subscribers at no cost to those subscribers to system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided that such extension is technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the system, or as further provided for under this agreement. 
    No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground, existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a density of less than ten subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the company and subscribers in the area in which service may be expanded, the company shall contribute an amount equal to or more than the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals ten subscribers. Potential subscribers shall bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a prorated basis. The company may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. 
    9.3.  Broad categories of service. The company shall continuously distribute over the system services within the following broad categories of services: news, sports, variety, audio, movie services, ethnic, cultural, financial information, music, religion, consumer information, family and children's entertainment, local over-the-air television broadcast station signals, local origination programming, and access channel programming. It is understood and agreed that the city may not dictate specific program service requirements, except to the extent authorized by applicable law. Any modification of services shall be consistent with the company's obligation to provide a broad category of programming services and to retain this mix, quality, and level of service. Thirty days prior to the effective date of any change in fees, charges, converter channel location, or program offerings (when reasonably possible), the company shall send written notice of such changes to the city and to all affected subscribers. The company shall comply with applicable provisions of the city, State of Texas, or federal laws governing the pricing of services. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the city may, in its discretion, choose to regulate the rates which the company may charge for the provision of basic service. 
    9.4.  Handicapped service plan. The company shall take affirmative steps to ensure maximum practical availability of the services and facilities of the subscriber system to handicapped persons, including access services and facilities. Upon written request by the city, the company shall submit to the city manager a plan demonstrating how the company intends to ensure the availability of its services and facilities to handicapped persons, including specific programming and facility access proposals. 
9.5.  Commercial access. 
    9.5.01.  Leased channels. The subscriber system shall contain leased channels as are economically feasible. 
    9.5.02.  Permitted users. The leased channels shall at all times be available for programming and other services by persons other than the company and affiliated persons at negotiated terms and conditions and subject to applicable laws. 
    9.6.  Access channels. As part of the basic service on the subscriber system, the company shall dedicate and supply, without charge: (1) a minimum of three activated video channels, as requested by the city, any one or more of which channels may be used for audio or data services; and (2) access to the upstream capacity when activated. Such channels and upstream capacity shall constitute the access channels. In the event of an extension or renewal pursuant to section 4 of this agreement, the company shall dedicate and supply, without charge, at least two additional video channels as additional access channels, but not less than the number of additional access channels as mutually determined by the city and the company. The additional access channels shall be reserved for use as access channels but, until activated at the request of the city, may be used by the company.

    10.1.02.  Reservation of rights. No acceptance of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim that the city may have for further or additional sums payment under the provisions of the franchise ordinance or this agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the city. 
    10.1.03.  Not a tax.

(B)  Neither the company nor any affiliated person shall have or make any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the amount of franchise fee payments from or against any city taxes or other fees or charges which the company or any affiliated person is required to pay to the city; and neither the company nor any affiliated person shall apply or seek to apply all or any part of the amount of such payments as a deduction or other credit from or against any city taxes, other fees or charges or franchise fee obligations, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of the company and its affiliated persons. 
10.2.  Other payments. 
    10.2.01.  Renewal/modification costs.

The company also acknowledges that any such contributions, services, equipment, facilities, support, resources, and other activities shall not be deemed to be franchise fees chargeable against the fees to be paid to the city by the company pursuant to section 10.1 herein. The franchise fee payments shall take precedence over all other payments, contributions, services, equipment, facilities, support, resource, and other activities to be paid or supplied by the company. 
    10.2.03.  Continuing obligation. In the event the company continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of this agreement, the company shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of the franchise ordinance and this agreement, including, without limitation, all franchise fee and other payment provisions, throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of this agreement. 
10.3.  Security fund. 
    10.3.01.  Amount. On or before the effective date of this agreement, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this agreement, the company shall deposit with the city manager the amount of $25,000.00 which shall be provided in cash, or the form of an unconditional letter of credit or performance/surety bond, or other instrument in a form acceptable to the city manager and the city attorney. The letter of credit, bond, or other instrument shall in no event require the consent of the company prior to the collection by the city of any amounts covered by such letter of credit, bond, or other instrument. Such amount to be deposited with the city manager shall constitute the company's security fund. The city council may, in its sole discretion, reduce the amount of the security fund. The company shall be entitled to all interest actually earned by the city on any cash portion of the security fund; such interest will be paid to the company by the city on an annual basis. 
    10.3.02.  Purpose. The security fund shall serve as security for: (1) the faithful performance by the company of all material provisions of the franchise ordinance and this agreement; (2) any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the company's unexcused or uncured failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, permits, and other directives of the city council or the city manager issued pursuant to the franchise ordinance or this agreement or other applicable law; (3) the payment by the company of all liens and taxes, and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any act or default of the company, and all other payments due the city from the company pursuant to the franchise ordinance or this agreement; and (4) the loss of any payments required to be made by the company to the city, which would have been received by the city but for the company's failure to perform its obligations, during the period of time between the company's unexcused or uncured failure to perform and the date on which the city takes over, or authorizes any other person to take over, the construction, operation, or maintenance of a cable communications system in the city necessitated by such failure. The withdrawal of amounts from the security fund shall constitute a credit against the amount of the applicable liability of the company to the city but only to the extent of such withdrawal. 
    10.3.03.  Replenishment. Throughout the term of this agreement, the company shall maintain the security fund in the amount specified in section 10.3.01 herein or such other amount as may from time to time be agreed to by the city and the company. Within 14 days after receipt of notice from the city manager that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the company shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in section 10.3.01 herein, provided that such restoration obligation shall be suspended during the period of any judicial challenge by the company to the propriety of such withdrawal from the security fund, and provided further that, if it is determined that such withdrawal by the city was improper, the city shall restore the improperly withdrawn amount to the security fund, together with interest from the date of the withdrawal at the then prevailing rate applicable to judgments rendered against the city pursuant to Texas law. 
    10.3.04.  Special withdrawals. If the company: (1) fails to make any required payment within the time specified; (2) fails to pay to the city, within 30 business days after receipt of notice, any taxes or liens relating to the system that are due and unpaid; (3) fails to pay to the city, within 30 business days after receipt of notice from the city manager, any damages, claims, costs, or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any act or default of the company; or (4) fails to comply, within 30 business days after receipt of notice from the city manager, with any provision of the franchise ordinance or this agreement which the city manager and city council determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund; then the city manager may withdraw the amount therein from the security fund and pay it to the city, provided that, prior to each such withdrawal, the company shall be afforded an opportunity to cure any of such failures or present written comments contesting the validity of the withdrawal within 30 days after notice from the city manager that the withdrawal is to be made. 
    10.3.05.  Liquidated damages. In addition to the withdrawals authorized by section 10.3.02 and 10.3.04 herein, the city manager with the approval of the city council may withdraw from the security fund and pay to the city the amounts specified in this section 10.3.05 for any of the following performance failures by the company, provided that such failures are not cured by the company to the satisfaction of the city manager within 30 days after receipt of notice by the company from the city manager: 
(1)  Failure to furnish, maintain, and continue to offer all requested services to any person within the city upon the order of the city manager: $50.00 per day, for each day or part therein that such failure continues, up to a maximum of $100.00 per day for any single multiple dwelling unit; or 
(2)  Failure to provide data, documents, reports, or information to the city in connection with a system review: $500.00 per day for each day or part therein such failure occurs or continues. 
    The company acknowledges that the foregoing amounts are liquidated damages and not in the nature of a penalty. 
    10.3.06.  Notice of withdrawals. Within one week after each of the foregoing withdrawals authorized by sections 10.3.02, 10.3.04, and 10.3.05 herein, the city manager shall notify the company of the date and amount thereof. 
    10.3.07.  Return of deposit. Upon any termination of the franchise, other than a revocation, the company shall be entitled to the return of, or cancellation of, as the case may be, the security fund, or portion therein as remains on deposit with the city at such termination, and after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for any uncured failure by the company to comply with any provision of the franchise ordinance or this agreement, provided that, if the company continues to operate the system following any termination, then the company shall not be entitled to a return or cancellation of the security fund until the end of such continued operation. In the event of any revocation of the franchise, the security fund shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of such revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of such costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the company. 
    10.3.08.  Reservation of rights. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this agreement or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have.
