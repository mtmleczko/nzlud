PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the 1996 Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This 2001 republication includes all amendatory legislation through 04-09-2001, and was accomplished under the direct supervision of Teri L. Kemp, Editor. 
    The 1996 publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Mario Dell'Osso, City Attorney, Mr. Richard Derr, former City Administrator, and Ms. Susan Hensley, former City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

For example, the codifier may:

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.

(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated in the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

(a)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect.

Sec. 2-31. - Public participation in meetings.

All speakers must come to the podium unless the presiding officer permits otherwise. Comments from these citizens will be limited to no more than three minutes per speaker. In situations where a large number of citizens representing a certain delegation have signed up to speak, the mayor may ask the group to designate a spokesperson to present the group's comments to council. The presiding officer may establish a time limit on any discussion. Citizens shall observe the rules of decorum and courtesy and further shall speak only upon recognition by the mayor. No formal action or discussion by council is permitted on any issue not listed on the posted agenda. Any person may address the council concerning an agenda item in accordance with these same procedures. Provided, however, that if a person has addressed the council at any of its three previous regular meetings and whose comments do not relate to an identifiable issue on the agenda, then that person's comments will be limited to one minute. 
(b)  No one except members of the council and officers of the city in the discharge of their official duties shall be permitted to participate in the deliberations of the council concerning an agenda item. 
(c)  Public hearings may be held as determined by the mayor or as otherwise provided by law.

A council member may ask questions of a person at any time during the hearing. The mayor or other presiding officer shall allocate the speaking time for participants based upon the number of persons addressing the council. The mayor or presiding officer may request that a speaker eliminate repetitious or irrelevant testimony. The council may postpone or continue a public hearing to a later date by announcing at the time and location stated in the notice for the scheduled hearing or during the public hearing the specific date, time and place of the continuance. 
(d)  The mayor or other presiding officer may determine the location of recording equipment and the manner in which the recording is conducted so long as such rules do not unreasonably impair a person's right to record an open meeting. 
(Ord. No. 40-2012, § 1, 11-19-12) 
Sec. 2-32. - Parliamentary rules. 
    In all council meetings the following rules of procedure will be followed: 
(1)  Questions to contain one subject. All questions (motions) submitted for a vote shall contain only one subject. If a question contains two or more subjects and the question reasonably permits a division, then any member may require a division. 
(2)  Discussion. Discussion on an agenda item may be held prior to a motion. Generally discussion on any agenda item shall be limited to ten minutes. 
(3)  Main motion. A subject is introduced by a main motion. Once seconded, no other topics should be taken up until after the motion is disposed of. 
(4)  Second. Any motion requires a second or it dies for lack of a second. A presiding officer, other than the mayor, may second a motion. 
(5)  Motion to amend. This motion is used when the intention is to change, add, or omit some part of a main motion. This motion is debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. A motion to amend is not amendable. First a vote is held on the motion to amend. If that vote is affirmative, the second vote is held on the main motion as amended. Only one amendment to a motion may be on the floor at any one particular time. 
(6)  Motion to table or postpone to a time certain. This motion requires that consideration of the main motion be delayed until a certain, stated time for, among other reasons, obtaining more information. A future date certain shall be set when the subject is considered. This motion is debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(7)  Motion to table indefinitely. This motion postpones consideration of the main motion in such a way that the issue being discussed may be taken up at an unspecified, later date when a majority of the members present vote to "call it from the table." This motion is not debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(8)  Motion to call the question. This motion is made to end discussion that has become lengthy or repetitious. When seconded, the mayor or presiding officer immediately calls the vote on the question of closing the discussion. This motion is not debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. 
(9)  Motion to reconsider. The council may reconsider a vote during the same meeting on motion by a member who voted on the prevailing (winning) side of the issue. This motion is debatable and requires a majority vote of the members present for passage. If that vote is affirmative, a second vote is held on the issue to be reconsidered. 
(10)  Vote. The mayor or presiding officer shall call for a vote by requesting "all in favor say aye" and "all opposed say nay". The mayor or any other member may request a show of hands at any time, including immediately after a voice vote. No member may vote by proxy. 
(11)  Frivolous or delaying motions. The mayor or presiding officer shall not entertain any motion that is frivolous or clearly made for purpose of delay. 
(12)  Point of order, questions and inquiries. A point of order may be raised at any time and supersedes any issue being discussed at the time. The mayor or presiding officer shall rule on the point of order before proceeding. One dissatisfied with the ruling may appeal to the meeting for a final decision. The appeal is debatable and the mayor or presiding officer may participate in the debate without giving up the chair. A majority of no votes is necessary to reverse the ruling. Whenever necessary, advice may be asked as to correct procedures or facts may be requested. The mayor or presiding officer shall respond to the question or refer it to the proper person. 
(13)  Motion to adjourn. At the conclusion of business, the mayor or presiding officer may declare the meeting adjourned without waiting for a motion or a member may move to adjourn. A motion to adjourn by a member is not debatable and a majority vote of the members present is required for passage. When the meeting is adjourned, the meeting is immediately halted. 
(14)  Suspension of rules. Any one or all of these rules provided in this chapter may be suspended by a majority vote. A motion to suspend rules cannot interrupt an individual speaking. This motion is debatable. 
(Ord. No. 40-2012, § 1, 11-19-12) 
Sec. 2-33. - Executive sessions. 
    Executive sessions are parts of meetings closed to the public.

Prior to the executive session, the presiding officer shall announce the executive session and the section or sections of the Texas Open Meetings Act under which the executive session is authorized. The mayor or presiding officer, or another person designated by the mayor or presiding officer, shall keep a certified agenda of the meeting. No voting will be conducted in the executive session. Adjournment of the executive session and any vote needed shall be made during the regular or special meeting.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 42-1. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equal or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) shall mean the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30,AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. Also called "the base flood." 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited t buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM's effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide, (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS). See Flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See also Flooding. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in an combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and include any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area. See Area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Secs. 42-9-42-18. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 42-19. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has, in V.T.C.A., Texas Water Code § 16.311 et seq., as amended, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the city does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 42-20. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 42-21. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;

(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 42-50. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in sections 42-3, 42-35(8), or 42-51(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure, including all mechanical and electrical improvements, shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above one foot above the base flood elevation or to the level of the crown of the nearest public street or one foot above the high point of the natural grade of the ground adjacent to the floor, whichever is higher. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 42-36(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure, including all mechanical and electrical improvements, shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.

b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (4) be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 42-36(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4). 
    A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. 06-09, § 2, 5-11-09) 
Sec. 42-51. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 42-20-42-22. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 42-4; section 42-36; and the provisions of article III. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to article I, division 1, or subsection 42-35(8). 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

Sec. 42-52. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-3, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 42-36 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 42-53. - Floodways. 
    Floodways-Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-3, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05) 
Sec. 42-54. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said hold shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 023-05, § 1, 11-14-05; Ord. No. 14-08, § 4, 10-13-08) 
Sec. 42-55. - Penalties for non compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court order and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than one day, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

The application of such traffic control devices shall be consistent with the standards and provisions of the latest edition of the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Appropriate warning lights shall be used at all construction and maintenance zones where one or more traffic lanes are being obstructed during nighttime conditions. 
(i)  Closing of streets. If a user's work requires the obstruction of any street for a period longer than 30 minutes, such obstruction shall be approved by director of public works, which approval may be conditioned on adequate traffic control measures. The user shall not close any public street, but shall at all times maintain a route of travel along and within any roadway that is within a public right-of-way; provided however, in cases of an emergency, the director of public works may authorize the temporary closing of a public street or sidewalk to allow the user to complete such emergency repairs if, in the opinion of the director of public works, such closing is necessary to protect the safety of the general public. 
(j)  Construction drawings. Within 120 days following completion of construction, or within 120 days following any material alteration or modification thereto, the user shall supply the city with a complete set of construction drawings for the work, or for the material alteration or modification thereof, unless the user certifies to the city, in writing, that such construction was completed in accordance with the construction plans filed pursuant to subsection (c) above, in which case, such construction plans shall be marked accordingly by the city and filed as the "permanent construction drawings." For the purposes hereof, a material alteration or modification of a facility shall be deemed to have occurred if such alteration or modification would render the existing construction drawings inaccurate and/or misleading regarding the location of a structural component thereof. Such drawings shall be of sufficient detail to allow the city to determine the location of the facilities with reasonable accuracy. In lieu of print documents, a user may, upon advance reasonable request, provide such drawings and maps by other mediums, including electronic mediums, provided the city has the capability to access such information.

    For purposes of this indemnification provision, acts or omissions of the officer, agents, employees and contractors of the user shall be considered the acts and omissions of the user.

Sec. 70-46. - Streets. 
(a)  Conformity to major street plan. The width and location of streets shall conform to such major street plan as the city council may have adopted, if any, both as to the horizontal and vertical alignment of pavements and right-of-way widths. 
(b)  Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system shall extend all existing major streets and such existing secondary and local access streets as may be desirable for convenience and circulation. Where possible, the width and the horizontal and vertical alignment of extended streets shall be observed primarily with respect to the major thoroughfare plan of the county, The Woodlands, Shenandoah and the City of Houston. 
(c)  Street jogs. Where offsets of street alignment are, in the opinion of the commission, unavoidable, such offsets may be employed, provided the distance between centerlines is not less than 125 feet. 
(d)  Large lot subdivisions. If the lots in the proposed subdivision are large enough to suggest resubdivision in the future, or if part of the tract is not subdivided, consideration must be given to possible future street openings and access to future lots which could result from such resubdivision. 
(e)  Through traffic. Local residential streets shall be designed so as to discourage high speed or through traffic. 
(f)  Topography. The street system shall bear a logical relationship to the natural topography of the ground. 
(g)  Right-of-way widths. Street right-of-way widths shall be measured from front lot line to front lot line of opposite lots. 
(1)  Local access streets. Local access streets shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet. 
(2)  Secondary or feeder streets. Secondary or feeder streets shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet. 
(3)  Major streets. The width of major streets shall be determined by the city council, the commission, the major street plan and adopted standards. Major streets with a width of less than 100 feet are to be increased to a width of 100 feet for a distance of 150 feet with the approach to a thoroughfare intersection with a transition back to the normal right-of-way over a distance of an additional 150 feet. 
(h)  Street alignment. The maximum deflection of alignment permitted without the use of curves shall be ten degrees. 
(i)  Major street curves. Curves in major streets shall have a centerline radius of 2,000 feet or more, with exceptions to this standard granted only by the city council in writing.

(3)  Centerline tie with existing streets. Each new street intersecting with or extending to meet an existing street shall be tied to the existing street on the centerline with dimensions and bearing to show the relationship. 
(p)  Partial or half streets. Partial or half streets may be provided where the commission feels that a street should be located on a property line. The following note shall be used in all such dedications: "This _____ foot strip is dedicated as an easement for all utility purposes, including storm and sanitary sewers, and shall automatically become dedicated for street purposes when and insofar as a _____ foot strip adjacent to it is so dedicated and the required improvements are as installed." A bond shall be required for the construction costs of the half street. 
(q)  Reserve strips. Provisional one-foot reserves may be used along the side or end of streets that abut acreage tracts, accompanied by a note on the plat as follows: "One-foot reserve to become automatically dedicated for street purposes when adjacent property is recorded in a plat." 
(r)  Street names. New streets shall be named so as to provide continuity of names of existing streets and so as to prevent conflict with identical or similar names in other parts of the county. All streets named shall be approved by the commission. 
(Ord. No. 002-85, § 5.01, 3-20-85) 
Sec. 70-47. - Lots. 
(a)  Use. All lots shown on the plat will be for residential purposes unless otherwise noted.

(Ord. No. 002-85, § 5.06, 3-20-85) 
Sec. 70-52. - Reservations. 
(a)  Permitted purposes. No land contained in a proposed subdivision shall be reserved for any use other than a use permitted by the city council for the zoning in which the land to be reserved is located. 
(b)  Designation on plat. The specific use for which each piece of land is to be used must be shown by appropriate label or description on the plat; provided that land to be used for any purpose other than residential uses, may, if the specific use is not known, be described as a restricted or unrestricted reserve. 
(c)  Parks and playgrounds. The location and size of parks and playgrounds shall be in accordance with the city council's plan, if any, and with the requirements of the city council. Park sites are to be purchased at the developer's acreage cost plus a prorated cost of improvements. 
(d)  Schools. The location and size of schools shall be in accordance with the city council plan with respect to school location, if any, and with the requirements of the school district. 
(e)  Unrestricted reserves. Reserves, tracts or those individual parcels of land in the subdivision plat which are not divided into lots are established to accommodate some specific purpose such as a commercial center, industrial site, golf course or other type of private facility. Since the use of reserve tracts cannot be completely determined by the subdivider or the developer at the time plats are prepared and submitted to the city planning and zoning commission, these reserved tracts may be established as unrestricted reserve, which allows maximum flexibility in the determination of the ultimate use for such properties. All unrestricted reserves will be bound by a one-foot reserve within the adjacent street right-of-way which will not permit access to the reserve tracts before those plats are resubmitted to the city council or commission for an approved land plan and plat. 
(f)  Restricted reserves. Where a specific purpose is established for a reserve tract, such intended use must be noted and identified on the plat. The building of noted improvements within the restricted reserve will require a site plan to be submitted to the city planning and zoning commission and approved by the commission and city council before construction commences. Where public facilities or rights-of-way will be dedicated during future development of restricted reserves, a replat of the restricted reserve will be necessary. 
(g)  Minimum area. Minimum area is 9,000 square feet. 
(Ord. No. 002-85, § 5.07, 3-20-85; Ord. No. 009-06, § 2, 6-26-06; Ord. No. 21-2014, § 6, 3-24-14) 
Sec. 70-53. - Use of septic tanks. 
    No plat submitted for preliminary or final plat approval shall be approved within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city with septic tanks for sanitary sewage disposal or treatment. 
(Ord. No. 002-85, § 5.08, 3-20-85) 
Sec. 70-54. - Compensating open space. 
    In those instances where proposed lots have an area less than the minimum established by the commission, compensating open space will be required and can be approved by the commission and city council. For planned unit developments, compensating open space must be made available based on the density of development and in accordance with the general zoning requirements of the city. Such compensating open spaces may remain undeveloped or be landscaped and may be developed for recreational purposes within the planned unit development, both active and passive. They may be used to provide courtyard access from the groups or clusters of lots adjacent to public streets or for temporary stormwater detention structures within the planned stormwater facility plan of the city.

(Ord. No. 010-99, § 1-11, 5-24-99) 
Sec. 76-29. - Public rights-of-way use license. 
(a)  Application required; contents. Any person proposing to place network facilities within public rights-of-way shall submit an application to the city. Applications may be filed in the office of the city secretary. An application shall describe in general terms all services the applicant will offer or provide, and shall outline the applicant's proposed network facilities, including a description of the physical characteristics of the network facilities proposed to be installed in the public rights-of-way. The city council may require the following information: 
(1)  The identity of the applicant and all affiliates of the applicant which may use in any manner the network facilities to provide telecommunications services within the city; 
(2)  A general description of the principal transmission medium that will be used by the applicant to offer or provide such telecommunications services; 
(3)  Preliminary engineering plans, specifications, and a network map of planned or projected new network facilities to be located within the city, all in sufficient detail to identify:

(7)  The legal authority of an applicant. 
(c)  License ordinance. License ordinances adopted by city council shall be deemed to incorporate all provisions of this chapter. A license ordinance shall be deemed as authorization for the applicable licensee to use the public rights-of-way for the provision of telecommunications services. No network facility shall be located, or made use of, in any public right-of-way in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter and/or the license ordinance. No license ordinance shall be construed to grant access to "city property," as defined herein, unless specifically included therein. No licensee shall use a public right-of-way or allow any other person to use licensee's network facilities in a public right-of-way, except as provided in the applicable license ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a license ordinance shall not be required for a person engaging solely in the resale of a licensee's services or the provision of services by unbundled network elements obtained from a licensee, provided that the applicable license ordinance authorizes the network facilities involved and the person does not own or operate any network facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Conditions of license. The issuance of any license pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  Interference with public use prohibited. All licensees shall lay, construct, erect, operate, lease, maintain, repair, and replace their network facilities in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the use of public rights-of-way, public streets and sidewalks, or other public or private ways. 
(2)  Compliance with law. Licensees are explicitly subject to the police powers of the city and the city's rights as a property owner under state and federal laws. All work done by licensees in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of its network facilities in public rights-of-way shall be subject to and governed by all applicable federal, state, and city rules, regulations, laws, and ordinances. The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all licensees and to any other person owning, operating, or in control of network facilities located within public rights-of-way. 
(3)  Construction regulations. 
a.  Excavations. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be performed in accordance with all applicable state, federal, and city regulations. 
b.  Interference with use of property. All construction within public rights-of-ways shall be undertaken so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property and in accordance with any lawful direction given by the city under the police and regulatory powers of the city. 
c.  Construction permits. Before commencing any construction of network facilities within a public right-of-way, a licensee shall apply for and obtain a new construction permit. Provided, however, acquisition of construction permits shall not be required prior to construction necessitated by emergency conditions or for routine maintenance. The permit application shall include a written work description, including scale drawings with a plan and profile showing the network facilities' location (or proposed location), and the estimated depth of the network facilities (existing and proposed) in the immediate area of the proposed new construction. Such drawings and specifications shall be reviewed by the city engineer and, if disapproved, returned with comments setting forth the reasons for such disapproval. Approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Licensees shall not commence construction until the drawings and specifications have been approved. Upon completion of any such work, the licensee shall promptly restore the surface of the affected public right-of-way to a condition which equals or exceeds its condition prior to such construction. To such end, the licensee shall replace excavated areas with the same type of materials as those removed, unless alternate equivalent materials are approved by the city. Any excavated areas showing depressions within one year following such work shall be restored by the licensee. Licensees may excavate public rights-of-way only for the purpose of, and to the extent reasonably required for, the construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, or maintenance of its network facilities. Review and approval by the city of construction permits as provided herein shall not constitute any representation or warranty regarding the sufficiency of design or construction of the network facilities. 
d.  Emergency repairs. Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 76-29(d)(3)c., during emergency situations where, in the good faith judgment of a licensee, failure to act immediately could jeopardize public health, safety, or general welfare, licensees may perform emergency repairs to facilities within public rights-of-way, including necessary excavation, without prior notification to the city. In such cases, the licensee shall notify the director of public works for the city before the close of business on the next business day following such emergency repairs, stating the nature of such repairs and the length of time estimated to complete same. The licensee shall apply for the required approvals as soon as reasonably practicable, and any work performed that is not consistent with then-applicable city standards shall be corrected upon notice thereof from the city. 
e.  Routine maintenance. Routing maintenance on network facilities located within public rights-of-way shall be conducted in a manner that is consistent with then-applicable city regulations governing such work, if any. 
f.  Obstructions of traffic. Any obstruction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic resulting from construction or repair activities of a licensee, other than for emergency repairs, shall require the prior approval of and a permit from the director of public works of the city. Any such work shall be performed in a manner calculated to cause the least inconvenience to the city and the public as is reasonably possible under the circumstances. When a licensee performs or causes to be performed any work over or across a public street or sidewalk, or so closely adjacent thereto as to create hazards for the public or itself, the licensee shall provide construction and maintenance signs and sufficient barricades and flag men at such sites as are reasonably necessary to protect the public and the licensee's equipment and workers. The application of such traffic control devices shall be consistent with the standards and provisions of the latest addition of the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Appropriate warning lights shall be used at all construction and maintenance zones where one or more traffic lanes are being obstructed during nighttime conditions. 
g.  Closing of streets. If a licensee's work requires the obstruction of any street for a period longer than 30 minutes, the closure shall be performed in a manner approved by the director of public works. The licensee shall not wholly close any public street, but shall at all times maintain a route of travel along and within any roadway that is within a public right-of-way; provided that, in cases of an emergency, the director of public works may authorize the temporary closing of a public street or sidewalk to allow the licensee to complete such emergency repairs if, in the opinion of the director of public works, such closing is necessary to protect the safety of the general public. 
h.  As-built drawings. Within 120 days following completion of each segment of its network facilities, or within 120 days following any material alteration or modification thereto, each licensee shall supply the city with a complete set of "as-built" drawings for that segment, or for the material alteration or modification thereof, unless the licensee certifies to the city, in writing, that such construction was completed in accordance with the construction plans filed pursuant to subsection 76-29(d)(3) above, in which case such construction plans shall be marked accordingly by the city and filed as the "as-built" drawings. For the purposes hereof, a material alteration or modification of a network facility shall be deemed to have occurred if such alteration or modification would render the existing "as built" drawings inaccurate and/or misleading regarding the location of a structural component thereof. Such drawings shall be of sufficient scale and detail to allow the city to accurately determine the location of the licensee's network facilities. In lieu of "as-built" print documents, a licensee may, upon advance reasonable request, provide such drawings and maps by other mediums, including electronic mediums, provided the city has the capability to access such information. 
(4)  Conservation of public rights-of-way. To the extent the city may be authorized by state or federal law to do so, and to the extent reasonable under the circumstances then existing, the city may require a licensee to attach portions of their facilities to other facilities within the public rights-of-way owned and maintained by other persons. A licensee shall not be required to attach its facilities to the facilities of such other persons if it is shown that such licensee would be subjected thereby to increased risks of interruption to its service, to increased liability for accidents, or to unreasonable delays in construction or availability of service, or if the facilities of such other person are not of the character, design, or construction required by, or are not being maintained in accordance with, current practice, or are not available to the licensee on reasonable terms, including, without limitation, reasonable fees. 
Insofar as is practical to do so, licensees shall use existing network facilities in the provision of their services; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting a telecommunications provider from expanding its facilities to accommodate future growth and development. Licensees shall provide information to the city relating to the location and/or operation of their network facilities or services as may be reasonably necessary for municipal planning purposes. 
(5)  Relocation or removal of facilities. A licensee may be required to lower, place underground, relocate, or remove any network facility within any public right-of-way, without cost to the city, if reasonably necessary, as determined by the city council, to abate a condition actually or potentially dangerous to public health or safety, or as may be reasonably necessary to accommodate the construction, repair, maintenance, removal, or installation of any city or other governmental entity's publicly funded project within the city in, upon, or under public rights-of-way, including, without limitation, street construction and widening, water, sanitary sewer, storm drains, street lights, and traffic signal conduits, or any other public facilities in, upon, or under the public rights-of-way. In the alternative, where the city council determines it to be feasible, a licensee may be allowed to pay the additional costs incurred for the design and/or construction of any such public works project in a manner that would avoid the necessity of relocation or removal of the network facilities. A licensee shall be provided the opportunity to collaborate in advance with the city and/or propose alternatives in order to minimize cost, better schedule the work, and accommodate suitable refinements and/or joint work with others. 
In the event of any such requirement for lowering, placing underground, relocating, or removing network facilities as herein provided, the licensee shall complete same as soon as is reasonably practicable following written notice thereof by the city. 
(6)  Timely completion. If a licensee fails to either: (i) commence or thereafter diligently prosecute any repair, refilling, lowering, relocation, removal, or other work required by the city; or (ii) diligently complete any work that disturbs a public right-of-way, the city may cause the work to be done or completed at the expense of the licensee and may recover all such expense from the licensee, together with all costs and reasonable attorneys fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a licensee shall be entitled to notice and opportunity to cure during the cure period described and set forth in subsection 76-32(b) hereunder, and shall not be liable for any costs under this section unless such licensee fails to timely complete during such cure period. 
(7)  Abandonment of obsolete network facilities. Licensees shall remove aerial network facilities and/or network facilities in conduits when such network facilities are obsolete and no longer in service. When permanent structures in public rights-of-way are removed or abandoned, the city shall be notified in writing of such removal or abandonment. The director of public works may direct such remedial measures as the director may determine are necessary for public safety and the integrity of public rights-of-way. 
(8)  Bonding. A licensee shall comply with all applicable regulations of the city relating to the provision of bonds or other security which may be required in connection with work in public rights-of-way. 
(9)  Temporary rearrangement of aerial wires. Upon request, a licensee shall remove or raise or lower its aerial network facilities temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting same, excluding requests by the city or other governmental entities requiring such rearrangement for public project purposes. The licensee may require payment in advance. The licensee shall be given a reasonable amount of advance notice to provide for such rearrangement, but in no event shall such notice be required to exceed four business days. 
(10)  Tree trimming. A licensee is authorized to trim trees upon and overhanging public rights-of-way to the extent reasonably necessary to prevent the branches thereof from coming in contact with the licensee's network facilities. At the option of the city, a licensee may be required to conduct tree trimming under the supervision and direction of the city through the city official to whom such duty has been or may be delegated. 
(11)  Term. The term of each license granted pursuant hereto shall be as set forth in the license ordinance, but shall not exceed ten years. 
Sec. 76-30. - Compensation; books and records. 
(a)  Licensee fees for providers of wired telecommunications services. Licensees using public rights-of-way for the provision of wired telecommunications services shall pay to the city a license fee that is calculated by applying a monthly charge for each access line owned, placed, operated, controlled or maintained by the licensee, during the month to which the licensee fee applies, for use by an end-user or for another provider that uses the licensee's services or network facilities for the provision of telecommunications services within the city. With regard to persons leasing, reselling, or otherwise using licensee's access lines, if the licensee does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate access line type, and, thus, the appropriate fee rate to apply, then the higher line fee shall apply until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the licensee sufficient written information to determine the correct line fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a licensee shall not be liable for underpayment of license fees resulting from the licensee's reliance upon the written information provided by any such person using licensee's service or facilities for the provision of telecommunications services to end-user customers. The license fee payable to the city shall be the sum total of the monthly charges to be applied to access lines, on a calendar month basis, as follows: 
Access Line Type Monthly Charge (per Access Line) Residential $_______ Non-Residential $_______ [OR] Monthly Charge (per Access Line) METRICOM will pay four percent of gross revenues for all of the monthly subscriptions that have a billing address in the city.  
(1)  Payment due dates; calculation report; access lines. License fees shall be paid quarterly, with such payments due and payable on or before the 45th day following the end of the calendar quarter for which such payments apply. With every quarterly remittance, each licensee shall file a written report showing the number and type of access lines owned or placed and maintained by the licensee within the city that are activated for end-user customers and other telecommunications providers at month's end, for each of the three calendar months to which such remittance applies. Such report shall specifically identify access lines owned, placed, operated, controlled, or maintained by the licensee that are leased and/or used by persons who are not end-user customers. Such report shall show the number of access lines by category, to the extent known. The report shall be used solely for the purpose of verifying the number of the licensee's access lines serving premises within the city. 
(2)  Exclusions for certain economically disadvantaged customers. Lines terminating at customers' premises that are billed as "Lifeline," "Tele-Assistance," or other services similarly discounted for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged, shall not be included in the count of access lines for which the license fee is calculated. 
(3)  Leased network facilities. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter to the contrary, a licensee shall not be required to include in its monthly count of access lines, and shall not be required to remit a license fee to the city based on access lines that are resold, leased, or otherwise provided to another person for consideration if: (i) the other person is operating pursuant to a valid license under this chapter; and (ii) the other person has furnished licensee with adequate proof that the person intends to include the leased access lines in its monthly count to the city, the person intends to remit to the city a license fee based on those leased access lines, and the city has approved the arrangement. 
(b)  License fees for providers of wireless telecommunications services. Licensees using public rights-of-way for the provision of wireless telecommunications services shall pay to the city a license fee that is calculated by applying a monthly charge calculated in accordance with one of the following methods described in this section. 
(1)  Access line method. Licensees may elect to pay a license fee that is calculated by applying a monthly charge for each access line to end-user customers within the city that use the licensee's services or network facilities for the provision of telecommunications services. A monthly charge shall be applied for each access line to an end-user customer having a billing address within the city. The license fee payable to the city shall be the sum total of the monthly charges to be applied to access lines, on a calendar month basis, as follows: 
Monthly Fee (per Access Line) $_______ 
(2)  Gross revenue method. If the license fee provided for in subsection 76-30(b)(1) above would result in a fee which exceeds four percent of the applicable licensee's gross revenues from subscribers within the city, such licensee may pay a license fee which equals four percent of the gross revenues received by such licensee from end-user customers within the city. For the purposes hereof, the term "gross revenues" shall mean the gross dollar amounts received by the licensee for wireless telecommunications services provided to end-user customers with billing addresses in the city, but excluding: (i) the monthly charges collected pursuant to this section; (ii) local, state, or federal taxes collected by the licensee that have been billed to subscribers and separately stated on subscribers' bills; and (iii) uncollectible revenues. 
(3)  Facilities charge method. A licensee providing wireless telecommunications services within the city which does not occupy more than 500 linear feet, 200 square feet, or 100 cubic feet of the public rights-of-way for the location of its network facilities, may pay an annual license fee based on the actual network facilities located within such public rights-of-way. Such license fees shall be calculated in accordance with public right-of-way use fee schedules as may be adopted by the city council from time to time and in effect at the time the applicable license ordinance is adopted. 
(4)  Payment due dates; calculation report. License fees shall be paid quarterly, with such payments due and payable on or before the 45th day following the end of the calendar quarter for which such payments apply. With every quarterly remittance, each licensee shall file a written report showing the number of subscribers within the city that are served by the licensee, the gross revenues received by the licensee, or an inventory of network facilities in the city's public right-of-way, as applicable, for each of the three calendar months to which such remittance applies. Such report shall specifically identify any network facilities owned, operated, or maintained by the licensee that are leased and/or used by persons who are not end-users. Such report shall show the number of subscribers of such persons leasing or using such facilities, if any, to the extent known. The report shall be used solely for the purpose of verifying the license fee payable to the city, as herein provided. 
(5)  Exclusions for certain economically disadvantaged customers. Subscribers that are billed as "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or for other services similarly discounted for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged, shall not be included in the count of subscribers for which the license fee is calculated. 
(6)  Leased network facilities. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter to the contrary, a licensee shall not be required to include in its monthly count of subscribers, and shall not be required to remit a license fee to the city based on, subscribers that are served by network facilities resold, leased, or otherwise provided to another person for consideration if: (i) the other person is operating pursuant to a valid license under this chapter; and (ii) the other person has furnished licensee with adequate proof that the person intends to include its subscribers in its monthly count to the city, the person intends to remit to the city a license fee based on those subscribers, and the city has approved the arrangement. 
(c)  License fees for providers not serving customers within the city. Providers using network facilities within public rights-of-way, but which serve no customers within the city, other than itself, shall pay an annual license fee based on the facilities located within such public rights-of-way. Such license fees shall be calculated in accordance with public right-of-way use fee schedules as may be adopted by the city council from time to time and in effect at the time the applicable license ordinance is adopted. This fee shall be due on or before July 15 of every year during the term of the license, prorated as applicable. A report shall be submitted with each annual payment showing the calculation of the payment, including necessary descriptions of the network facilities, as applicable. 
(d)  Reporting requirements. The forms required to be filed pursuant to subsections 76-30(a)(1), 76-30(b)(1), and 76-30(d) above shall be accompanied by a written statement, executed by a duly authorized officer or representative of the licensee, certifying that the information contained in such report is true and correct, to the best of the officer or representative's knowledge and belief, after due inquiry. A copy of the completed forms and the accompanying certified statements shall be filed with the city secretary. Such forms shall be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. Upon written request, licensees shall verify the information contained in such forms and, upon reasonable advance notice, all non-customer specific records and other documents required for verification shall be subject to inspection by the city, expressly excluding any records, documents, or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law. 
(e)  Late payments; default. Payments received after their due date shall incur interest at the rate of ten percent per annum, compounded daily. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure of a licensee to make a full payment within 30 days following the due date shall constitute an event of default. 
(f)  Circumvention of license fees prohibited. Licensees shall not circumvent payment of license fees by bartering, by transferring rights, or by other means that result in undercounting the number of access lines, or subscribers, as applicable, as required herein. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed access lines, or subscribers, are reported in accordance with this chapter. 
(g)  Uncollectibles. A licensee shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or subscribers for which revenues remain uncollectible. 
(h)  No release. No acceptance by the city of any payment by a licensee shall be construed as a release of, or an accord or satisfaction of, any claim that the city might have for further or additional sums payable under the terms of this chapter or a license ordinance, or for any other performance or obligation of the licensee. 
(i)  No other fees. License fees paid hereunder shall be in lieu of any permit, license, approval, inspection, or other similar fee or charge, including, but not limited to, all general business license fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the public rights-of-way against persons operating businesses similar to that of licensees. Further, such license fees shall constitute full compensation to the city for all of a licensee's network facilities located within the public rights-of-way, including interoffice transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of network facilities are not used in the calculation of a license fee. 
(j)  Records. Licensees shall retain and maintain all records, accounts, and financial and operating reports necessary to establish compliance with the terms of this chapter, for a period of not less than five years. 
(Ord. No. 010-99, § 1-11, 5-24-99) 
Sec. 76-31. - Indemnification and insurance. 
(a)  Indemnity. Each license ordinance shall contain the following indemnity provision: 
    The licensee shall promptly defend, indemnify, and hold the city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses, or expenses: (i) for the repair, replacement, or restoration of city's property, equipment, materials, structures, and facilities which are damaged, destroyed, or found to be defective solely as a result of the licensee's acts or omissions; and (ii) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action, and judgments for: (a) damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but not limited to, the licensee, its agents, officers, employees, and subcontractors, city, its agents, officers, and employees, and third parties); and/or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of income or wages to any person (including, but not limited to, the agents, officers, and employees of the licensee, licensee's subcontractors, city's officers, agents, and employees, and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning, or resulting from the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the licensee, its agents, employees, and/or subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to this chapter. 
    This indemnity provision is intended to include liability arising from the city's alleged negligence, but only to the extent such liability arises out of a claim or claims that the city was negligent in granting this license, in regulating the conduct of licensee under this license, or in failing to prevent licensee from acting in a negligent or wrongful manner. 
    The indemnity provision set forth above is: 
(1)  Solely for the benefit of the city and the licensee and is not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity; 
(2)  To the extent permitted by law, any payments made to, or on behalf of, the city under the provisions of this section are subject to the rights granted to licensees under V.T.C.A., Utilities Code, §§ 54.204-54.206; and 
(3)  Subject to the continued applicability of the provisions of V.T.C.A., Utilities Code §§ 54.204-54.206, as set forth in 76-31(a)(2) above, the provisions of the indemnity shall survive the expiration of this chapter. 
    If the authority granted by this chapter is terminated or is not renewed, and the licensee does not remove its network facilities from the public rights-of-way, the licensee shall continue to indemnify and hold harmless the city pursuant to this section as long as its facilities are located in the public rights-of-way, and for said purpose, this section shall survive this license ordinance. 
(b)  Insurance. Licensees shall procure and maintain, during the term of their licenses, the following insurance coverage, and the respective policies thereof shall cover all risks related to the licensee's use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way and all other risks associated with their license. 
(1)  Description of insurance coverage and limits.

a.  The city shall be named as an additional insured, by endorsement, on all applicable insurance policies; 
b.  Applicable insurance policies shall each be endorsed with a waiver of subrogation in favor of the city; 
c.  Insurers shall have a rating of B+ or better and a financial size of Class VI or better, according to the current year's Best's rating.

g.  Certificates of insurance shall be provided by a licensee to the city prior to the installation, construction, or operation of any network facilities within public rights-of-way; provided, however, any licensee lawfully operating network facilities within public rights-of-way at the time of adoption of such licensee's applicable license ordinance shall provide such certificates of insurance within 30 days following the effective date of such license ordinance. Any failure of the city to request such documentation shall not be construed as a waiver of the insurance requirements specified herein;

A licensee shall also provide to the city documentation evidencing its process for reviewing and paying claims. The city shall be protected by a licensee's self-insurance to the same extent as an additional insured on a policy issued by an insurance company. If, during the term of a license granted hereunder, a licensee's self-insurance program ceases, or a licensee's assets or reserves are no longer sufficient to comply with the above coverage requirements, the licensee shall immediately notify the city of such lapse of coverage, and the licensee shall obtain commercial insurance in accordance with the above requirements within 30 days following such notice. 
(c)  No right of recovery. Insurers shall have no right of recovery against the city, it being the intention hereby that the insurance policies required herein shall protect licensees and the city, and shall be primary coverage for all losses covered by such policies. Such policies shall provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation or assignment against the city in connection with any damage covered thereby. Companies issuing such policies shall have no recourse against the city for payment of any premiums or assessments, same being at the sole risk of the licensees. 
(d)  Lapse of coverage on event of default. A licensee shall continuously and without interruption maintain in full force and effect the required insurance coverage and limits set forth in this section. Failure to maintain such insurance shall constitute an event of default and the city, at its option, may terminate any license granted pursuant hereto, in accordance with the provisions of section 76-32 below. 
(Ord. No. 010-99, § 1-11, 5-24-99) 
Sec. 76-32. - Default and termination. 
(a)  Events of default. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an event of default by a licensee.

(2)  Any intentional false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact by an applicant;

(4)  An act or omission of a licensee constituting a knowing or intentional evasion of payment of any fee payable hereunder. 
(b)  Cure period. If a licensee continues to violate or fail to comply with a material term or provision of this chapter for a period of 30 days following notification in writing by the city to cure such specific alleged violation or failure to comply, then the city may follow the procedures set forth herein to declare that the licensee has terminated all rights and privileges consented to pursuant to this chapter and the licensee's license ordinance; provided, however, if a licensee is alleged to be in violation of any material provision of this chapter, other than the payment of a fee due hereunder, and if the licensee commences efforts to cure such alleged violation within 30 days following receipt of written notice thereof and shall thereafter prosecute such curative efforts with reasonable diligence until such curative efforts are completed, then such alleged violation shall cease to exist and no further action shall be taken at that time. 
(Ord. No. 010-99, § 1-11, 5-24-99) 
Sec. 76-33. - Transfer of authority. 
(a)  Prohibition. Any right, privilege, and license granted pursuant hereto may not be assigned, in whole or in part, without the prior consent of the city expressed by resolution or ordinance, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed, except as otherwise provided in subsection 76-33(d) below. No such consent by the city shall be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. No assignment in law or otherwise shall be effective until the assignee has filed with the city an instrument, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms hereof and of the license ordinance, and agreeing to comply with all the provisions thereof. A mortgage or other pledge of assets in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment of a license for the purposes of this chapter. 
(b)  Process. Upon receipt of a request for consent to an assignment, the city shall diligently investigate the request in a timely manner and place the request on the city council agenda at the earliest practicable time. The city council shall proceed to act on the request within a reasonable period of time. 
(c)  Scope of review. In reviewing a request for assignment, the city may, to the extent permitted by law, inquire into the legal, technical, and financial qualifications of the prospective assignee, and the licensee shall assist the city in so inquiring. The city may condition said assignment upon such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably necessary, provided its approval and any such terms and conditions so attached shall be related to the legal, technical, and financial qualifications of the prospective assignee, as well as the licensee's compliance with the terms hereof. 
(d)  Assignments not requiring approval. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter to the contrary, the prior approval of the city shall not be required for any assignment to: (i) any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the licensee, as long as such entity has expertise in the operation of the network facilities; (ii) any entity with which the licensee or an affiliate of the licensee shares joint ownership of the network facilities; or (iii) any entity that is a holder of a then-current comprehensive telecommunications (as distinguished from cable services) franchise or license ordinance. Provided, however, no such assignment shall be effective until the licensee shall have given written notice thereof to the city. 
(e)  Release. Upon receiving the city's consent to an assignment, or, in the event of an assignment qualifying under subsection 76-33(d) above, upon giving notice under subsection 76-33(d), a licensee shall be relieved of all conditions, obligations, and liabilities arising or which might arise hereunder that are assumed by the assignee.

Sec. 76-34. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Work by others, construction by abutting owners, and alterations to conform with public improvements. 
(1)  The city reserves the right to lay and permit to be laid, sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do and permit to be done, any underground and overhead work, and any attachment, restructuring, or changes in aerial facilities that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in, across, along, over, or under any public right-of-way occupied by providers, and to change any curb or sidewalk or the grade of any street. In permitting such work to be done, the city shall not be liable to providers for any damages not directly caused by the misconduct or gross negligence of the city; provided, however, nothing herein shall relieve any other person or entity, including any contractor, subcontractor, or agent from liability for damage to a licensee's facilities. 
(2)  If during a license term the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space over, under, or across the surface of any public right-of-way, such grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights herein granted to a licensee. In the event that the city shall close or abandon any public right-of-way, which contains any portion of a licensee's network facilities, any conveyance of land contained in such closed or abandoned public right-of-way shall be subject to the rights of a licensee hereunder and under the licensee's license ordinance. 
(3)  Providers shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any person used by such providers when such person is involved directly or indirectly in the construction and installation of such providers' network facilities to the same extent as if the acts or omissions of such person were the acts or omissions of the provider. 
(b)  Annexation and disannexation. Within 30 days following the date of passage of any action effecting the annexation of any property to, or the disannexation of any property from, the city's corporate boundaries, the city shall furnish licensees written notice of the action and an accurate map of the city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For the purpose of compensating the city under this chapter, a licensee shall start including or excluding access lines or subscribers, as applicable, within the affected area in the licensee's count of access lines or subscribers, as applicable, on the effective date designated by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas for the imposition of state local sales and use taxes; but in no case less than 30 days following the date the licensee is notified by the city of the annexation or disannexation. 
(c)  Confidential records. Upon the notification by a licensee to the city of the confidential nature of any information, report, document, or writing, the city shall maintain the confidentiality of such information, report, document, or writing to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the licensee's confidential information, report, document, or writing, the city shall notify the licensee of the request, in writing. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the applicable licensee, the city shall request an Attorney General's Opinion before disclosing any confidential information, report, document, or writing, and will furnish the licensee with copies of such requests. 
(d)  Abandonment of public rights-of-way. If the city conveys, closes, abandons, or releases its interest in or authority over any public right-of-way containing network facilities installed or operated pursuant to a license ordinance, any such conveyance, closure, abandonment, or release shall be subject to the rights of the licensee under the license ordinance. 
(e)  Right to audit. The city reserves the right to review and audit a licensee's books and records if the city deems it necessary to determine if appropriate amounts have been paid to the city hereunder. If any such audit discovers an underpayment due to the city that exceeds five percent of the total amount paid for any quarterly reporting period, then the licensee shall promptly reimburse the city for the actual and reasonable cost of such audit. Provider shall also pay the city all actual amounts of the underpayments as determined by the audit, plus interest as hereinabove provided. 
(f)  Force majeure. Other than for the failure to pay amounts due and payable under this chapter, a licensee shall not be in default or be subject to sanction under any provision of this chapter when its performance is prevented by force majeure. Force majeure shall mean an event caused by strike or other labor problem; embargo; epidemic; act of God; fire; flood; adverse weather conditions, or other major environmental disturbance; act of military authority; or war or civil disorder, provided that such causes are beyond the reasonable control and without the willful act, fault, failure, or negligence of the licensee. Performance is not excused under this section following the end of the applicable event of force majeure. 
(g)  Controlling law. This chapter, and any license issued hereunder, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas and venue for any action hereunder shall be in Montgomery County, Texas. 
(h)  Acceptance. A licensee shall, within 30 days following the effective date of any license ordinance adopted hereunder and applicable to such licensee, file with the city secretary an unqualified written statement executed in its name by an officer of the licensee, duly appointed and authorized to make such statement, as follows: 
"___________ [licensee], having been granted a License by the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas [City], as set forth in Ordinance No. _______ (the "License Ordinance"), which Ordinance is adopted pursuant to and under the terms of City of Oak Ridge North, Texas, Ordinance No. _______, same being AN ORDINANCE PROVIDING RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF CITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY BY PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (the "Regulatory Ordinance"), does hereby accept the terms of the License Ordinance and the Regulatory Ordinance, and promises to comply therewith, and with any amendments thereto which may be adopted from time-to-time, and to abide by the express provisions, terms, and conditions thereof, unless and until those provisions, terms, or conditions are duly amended or otherwise changed or modified by or as a result of a final order of a court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction. Licensee's rights and obligations shall not be deemed to be contractual, but are governed by the ordinances of the city, and state and federal law, and are not modified, expanded, or waived by the execution and delivery of this acceptance. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary, licensee expressly reserves any and all rights to challenge the applicability, enforceability, and/or legality of one or more of the terms of the ordinances to the extent such term or terms are alleged to exceed the lawful regulatory authority of the city."

When the number of persons per household increases so as to place the customer in a different allocation category, the customer may notify the city on such form and the change will be implemented in the next practicable billing period. If the number of persons in a household is reduced, the customer shall notify city in writing within two business days. In prescribing the method for claiming more than two persons per household, the chief of utility services shall adopt methods to insure the accuracy of the claim. Any person who falsely reports the number of persons in a household or fails to timely notify the city of a reduction in the number of persons in a household may be fined not less than $100.00. 
a.  Surcharges . Residential water customers must pay a surcharge of $50.00 for each 1 to 1,000 gallons over the customer's single-family residential water allocation. 
(2)  Master-metered multi-family residential customers. The allocation to a customer billed from a master meter that jointly measures water to multiple permanent residential dwelling units (e.g., apartments, townhomes, condominiums, mobile homes) shall be allocated 6,000 gallons per month for each dwelling unit. It shall be assumed that each master meter serves two dwelling units unless a customer notifies the city that a master meter serves a greater number of dwelling units on a form provided by the chief of utility services. The chief of utility services shall make his/her best effort to see that such forms are mailed, otherwise provided, or made available to every such customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such a form, it shall be the customer's responsibility to go to city hall to complete and sign the form claiming that a master meter serves more than two dwelling units. A dwelling unit may be claimed under this provision whether it is occupied or not. New customers may claim more dwelling units at the time of application for water service on the form prescribed by the chief of utility services. If the number of dwelling units served by a master meter is reduced, a customer shall notify the city in writing within two business days. The chief of utility services must adopt methods for claiming more than two dwelling units to insure the accuracy of a customer's claim. Any person who falsely reports the number of dwelling units served by a master meter or fails to timely notify the city of a reduction in the number of person in a household may be fined not less than $100.00. 
a.  Surcharges. Multi-family residential customers billed from a master meter under this provision must pay a surcharge of $50.00 for each one to 1,000 gallons over the customer's multi-family residential water allocation for each dwelling unit. 
(3)  Commercial customers. A monthly water allocation shall be established by the chief of utility services, or his/her designee, for each commercial customer other than an industrial customer who uses water for an industrial water use. The nonresidential customer's allocation shall be approximately 75 percent of the customer's usage for the corresponding month's billing period for the previous 12 months. If the customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no history exists. However, a customer with 75 percent monthly usage less than 6,000 gallons shall be allocated 6,000 gallons. The chief of utility services shall make his/her best effort to see that notice of each customer's allocation is mailed to each customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city to determine the allocation. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the chief of utility services, the allocation may be reduced or increased if, (1) the designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water usage, (2) one commercial customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another commercial customer, or (3) other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present conditions. A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city manager, or his/her designee. 
a.  Surcharges . Commercial customers must pay a surcharge of $150.00 for each 1 to 1,000 gallons over the commercial customer's water allocation. 
(4)  Industrial customers. A monthly water allocation shall be established by the chief of utility services, or his/her designee, for each industrial customer, which uses water for an industrial water use. The industrial customer's allocation shall be approximately 90 percent of the customer's water usage baseline. Ninety days after the initial imposition of the allocation for industrial customers, the industrial customer's allocation shall be further reduced to 85 percent of the customer's water usage baseline. The industrial customer's water usage baseline will be computed based on the average water usage for the 12-month period ending prior to the date of implementation of stage 2 of the plan. If the industrial customer's billing history is shorter than 12 months, the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no billing history exists. The chief of utility services shall make his/her best effort to see that notice of each industrial customer's allocation is mailed to such customer. If, however, a customer does not receive such notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city to determine the allocation, and the allocation shall be fully effective notwithstanding the lack of receipt of written notice. Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the chief of utility services, the allocation may be reduced or increased if (1) the designated period does not accurately reflect the customer's normal water use because the customer had shutdown a major processing unit for repair or overhaul during the period, (2) the customer has added or is in the process of adding significant additional processing capacity, (3) the customer has shutdown or significantly reduced the production of a major processing unit, (4) the customer has previously implemented significant permanent water conservation measures such that the ability to further reduce water use is limited, (5) the customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another industrial customer, or (6) if other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present conditions. A customer may appeal an allocation established hereunder to the city manager, or his/her designee. 
a.  Surcharges . Industrial customers must pay a surcharge of $150.00 for each one to 1,000 gallons over the industrial customer's water allocation.

If a person is convicted of three or more distinct violations of this plan, the chief of utility services shall, upon due notice to the customer, be authorized to discontinue water service to the premises where such violations occur. Services discontinued under such circumstances shall be restored only upon payment of a re-connection charge, hereby established at $100.00, and any other costs incurred by the city in discontinuing service. Compliance with this plan may also be sought through injunctive relief in the district court. 
(c)  Any person, including a person classified as a water customer of the city, in apparent control of the premises where a violation occurs or originates shall be presumed to be the violator, and proof that the violation occurred on the person's property shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the person in apparent control of the premises committed the violation, but any such person shall have the right to show that he/she did not commit the violation. Parents shall be presumed to be responsible for violations of their minor children and proof that a violation, committed by a child, occurred on property within the parents' control shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the parent committed the violation, but any such parent may be excused if he/she proves that he/she had previously directed the child not to use the water as it was used in violation of this plan and that the parent could not have reasonably known of the violation.

Sec. 10-A. - Fence regulations in the B-1 Neighborhood business district and the B-2 Secondary and highway business district; prohibited locations for fences in all commercial zoning districts. 
A.  Privacy fence required as a barrier and buffer. If any portion of a lot or tract of land zoned B-1 neighborhood business district or B-2 secondary and highway business district adjoins or abuts any property in a residential district, a privacy fence is required at all times to serve as a barrier and buffer between the dissimilar properties in those zoning districts, as follows: 
1.  Existing fence. An existing (there on September 1, 1999) privacy fence (no access or view from grade) which is at least six feet in height, which is located on a lot or tract zoned B-1 or B-2 business district, and which is between such property and any adjoining residential district property, shall be maintained by the B-1 or B-2 district property owner in good condition during its useful life, in order to serve as an effective barrier or buffer. Thereafter, the existing fence shall be replaced by a privacy fence (no access or view at grade) and maintained by the B-1 or B-2 district property owner, as required in this section. 
2.  Privacy fence required in connection with building permit issuance. A privacy fence (no access or view at grade) is required and shall be constructed by the B-1 or B-2 district property owner prior to or contemporaneous with completion of improvements authorized by a city building permit issued for any new, expanded, or additional commercial construction, except indoor remodeling, for property which is then currently developed or used for B-1 and B-2 district purposes; provided, however, a then existing privacy fence (no access or view at grade), if any, on such a B-1 or B-2 district property which is at least six feet in height, which is located along the property line, and which is in good condition shall satisfy the requirement for a privacy fence during its useful life, provided it is maintained in good condition. Thereafter, such existing fence shall be replaced by a privacy fence (no access or view at grade), as required by this section. 
3.  Privacy fence required upon development. A privacy fence (no access or view at grade) is required and shall be constructed by the commercial property owner prior to or contemporaneous with the commercial use of or construction of improvements on property being developed in the B-1 or B-2 business district. 
4.  Requirements applicable to all privacy fences. In order to serve the intended purposes as a barrier and buffer, a required privacy fence (no access or view at grade) shall be constructed and maintained in good condition, and replaced as necessary, by the owner of the B-1 or B-2 business district property, along the property line abutting or adjoining any residential district property. A privacy fence shall be at least eight feet in height, constructed of cedar, treated (by the manufacturer) pine, brick, or masonry, and the finished side (not showing mounting or supports) shall face away from the B-1 or B-2 district property.

(Ord. No. 14-2013, § 2, 3-11-13; Ord. No. 21-2017 , § 2(Exh. A), 12-18-17) 
Sec. 10-B. - Antennas and towers. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this Code shall govern the location of towers and antennas in the city. 
(2)  Public property. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property shall be exempt from the requirements of this Code, provided a license or lease authorizing the antenna or tower has been approved by the city council. 
(3)  Amateur radio and receive-only towers. This Code shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 100 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna. 
(4)  Grandfathered towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements of this Code other than the requirements of this Code for grandfathered towers and antennas. Any towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this Code shall be referred to as "grandfathered towers" or "grandfathered antennas." 
(b)  Guidelines and requirements. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish rules and regulations for the site placement and maintenance of towers and antennas of the type as herein defined and set out. The goals of this chapter are to encourage and to provide for the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, and to encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing towers. In addition, it is the purpose of these regulations to encourage the use of towers and antennas to be located in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal and to encourage the user of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and to enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently. 
(2)  Existing sites. Each applicant for a tower permit shall provide the city council an inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The city council shall review the data and information as may be submitted, and all data submitted in conjunction with an application as herein provided shall be deemed a part of the open and public record. 
(3)  Lighting. The guidelines set forth in this Code shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas; provided, however, that the governing body may in its sole discretion provide other regulations or other requirements that accomplish the objectives of this Code where it is found that the goals and purposes of this chapter and this Code are better served by such exceptions. 
(4)  Requirements. Towers shall either be constructed to maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue or gray so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(5)  Design requirements. At a tower site, the design of buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
(c)  Installation of an antenna of a structure other than a tower. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(d)  Lighting of towers prohibited. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council shall approve the design for lighting and the design must take into effect existing and contemplated uses of surrounding property and be configured in a way as to cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(e)  Federal and other governmental requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government or any other governmental entity with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If the standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Code shall bring the towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of the revised standards and regulations. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations shall constitute an immediate and automatic revocation of the authority granted under this chapter and the city may require the removal of any tower antenna in noncompliance at the cost of the owners. 
(f)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in the building codes of the city and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. The city, through the building official or other persons so designated, may inspect towers and antennas at any time, and if the building official finds and concludes that the tower or an antenna fails to comply with such codes and standards and/or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then the building official, upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, may order that the tower and antenna be brought into compliance with the codes and standards within a period not to exceed 30 days. If the owner fails to bring the tower into compliance within 30 days, the city council may order the removal of the tower and antennas at the expense of the owner. In the event a removal is ordered, the city shall not assume any liability for the removal and shall be entitled to a lien upon the personal property, fixtures or real estate for the purpose of paying its cost incurred in the removal. 
(g)  Specific use permit required. The city council finds and determines that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the city that no tower or antenna shall be constructed, erected or maintained in the city unless a permit, hereinafter referred to as a tower permit, shall have first been issued by the city council for the placement, location and maintenance of the tower and antenna. 
(h)  Application and fees. From time to time the city council may adopt an application form or procedure for the issuance of a tower permit. In addition, the city council may specify fees, costs and expenses that must be paid by the applicant as an application fee prior to the review or issuance of the tower permit. In the event the city council shall fail to specify or provide for tower permit application or a procedure for the issuance of a tower permit, then the building official is hereby directed to establish such procedure as shall be reasonable and necessary to accomplish the objectives of this Code. The application fee approved by the city council shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the cost incurred by the city in reviewing the application and material submitted by the applicant. In addition, prior to the issuance of any permit and as a condition for the issuance of a tower permit, the applicant shall pay any additional cost as may be incurred by the city, including, but not limited to, professional fees incurred in the review of any application. 
(i)  Requirements of an application. Each application filed hereunder shall show and attach thereto all relevant documents showing compliance with all laws and regulations promulgated by the federal government, including laws and regulations relating to the FAA or the FCC or any other governmental entity. In addition, no authority granted under this Code shall be deemed to have any final authority until an application for a building permit has finally been approved by the building official of the city. 
(j)  Shortened administrative process. 
(1)  The city council recognizes that there are certain circumstances where a tower permit may be issued administratively by the building official without review by the city council, and in this regard the building official is hereby directed and authorized to issue a tower permit as provided for under this chapter without referral to or review by the city council. The applicant for a tower permit by administrative approval shall first comply with all other requirements of this Code including making application on such form as may be from time to time provided by the city and paying the required fee. The authority herein granted to the building official shall be deemed discretionary by the building official and the building official may decline to issue a tower permit administratively and may refer the application to the city council for approval in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  The building official may approve a tower permit administratively if it is found that one or more of the following conditions or circumstances shall exist: 
a.  The proposed tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with the tower or antenna, will be located in an industrial or heavy commercial district or area of town. An industrial or heavy commercial area is one that is separated from any platted lot of record that is in residential use or intended for residential use by at least 1,000 feet from the closest point of any lot platted or used for residential purposes or, in the case of non-platted property, 1,000 feet from any structure actually used for residential purposes. In measuring or determining any of the distances as herein provided, measurements should be taken from the closest point of the lot or structure to the base or structural point of the tower closest to the residential lot or residential structure. 
b.  The installation of an antenna is on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other free-standing nonresidential structure) that is at least 50 feet in height or greater so long as the additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure. 
c.  The installation of an antenna is on an existing tower of any height so long as the addition of the antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing tower. The tower permit issued under this section shall not permit the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with the antenna. 
(k)  General requirements for approval of an antenna tower or structure and the issuance of a tower permit. The following general provisions shall govern the issuance of a tower permit and shall control all applications for a tower permit. Each applicant requesting a tower permit under this Code shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, or other documentation signed and sealed by appropriate professional engineers showing the location and dimensions of the improvement, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this Code, including such other and additional information as may be deemed necessary and required by the city council. 
(l)  Factors in considering the granting of the permit. The city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether or not to issue a tower permit and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate and necessary in order to determine that the goals of the code are properly served: 
(1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
(2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential districts; however, the city council shall not approve any tower which is closer than 1,000 feet to any lot platted for residential use or from any structure in residential use; 
(3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Surrounding topography; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
(6)  Design of the tower with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obstructions; 
(7)  The availability of suitable and existing towers and other structures presently constructed which are suitable for antenna location; and 
(8)  The environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the FCC regulations concerning such emissions shall not be considered. 
(m)  Availability of suitable towers or other structures. No new tower permit shall be issued unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or tower may consist of any of the following. 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineer's requirements; 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineer's requirements; 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures or the antennas on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
(5)  The fees or costs required to share an existing antenna or structure which will be paid at the beginning of a sharing relationship or will be paid within one year from the date of the inception of any sharing relationship exceed the cost of constructing a new tower; 
(6)  Property owner(s) of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs. The applicant must specify the reason for property owner(s) refusing to accommodate and submit satisfactory proof of non-accommodation, including documents evidencing appropriate financial tenders. 
(7)  The applicants demonstrate that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
(n)  Setbacks. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a tower permit is required; provided, however, that the governing body may, in its discretion, provide for other or different regulations if it finds that the goals of this Code are better served by such modifications. 
(1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to 200 feet from the nearest point to any lot platted for residential use or any structure in residential use. If the height of the antenna tower is deemed to be greater than 500 feet, then the setback as herein provided shall be three times the height of the tower. 
(2)  Towers, guys and accessory facilities must be constructed in a way to avoid adverse impact upon adjoining properties and the uses thereof. In addition, all such structures and apparatus must be properly screened by a visual barrier or fence of a height not less than eight feet and shall be appropriately marked. 
(3)  In all areas other than industrial and heavy commercial areas which are separated from lots platted for residential use or from structures in residential use by more than 1,000 feet, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter mile from an existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
(o)  Security. In addition to the fencing requirements as herein set out, all fencing shall be locked and secured and shall be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices; provided, that if the city council finds and determines that, because of natural barriers or the existence of other apparatus or conditions, this requirement is not necessary, the city council may in an appropriate case modify the screening and fencing requirements as herein set out. 
(p)  Landscaping. 
(1)  All towers constructed and maintained within the city limits shall be landscaped and maintained in accordance with the provisions as herein set out. The city council, however, upon appropriate application, may modify the provisions of this Code when it is deemed appropriate in accordance with the circumstances and conditions then existing. 
(2)  The requirements as herein provided are: 
a.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the tower compound. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. The applicant for a tower permit shall file with the city a landscape plan which shall be approved by the city council in conjunction with any application filed in accordance herewith. In the case of an application for administrative approval, the requirements for a landscape plan may be approved by the building official without city council approval if a request for administrative approval is granted. It shall be the duty of the applicant to fully maintain any landscaping as herein provided as a condition for the maintenance of the permit; and 
b.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be deemed by the city council to be a sufficient buffer. 
(q)  Removal of abandoned towers and antennas. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be deemed abandoned, and the owner of the antenna or tower shall remove the same within 30 days of the receipt of a notice from the city council notifying the owner of the abandonment. If the antenna or tower is not removed within the required 30 days, or such additional period as may be allowed by the city council upon application, the city council may remove the antenna or tower at the expense of the owner and may file a lien upon the real estate and any personal property or fixtures found to pay the cost of removal. 
(r)  Existing antennas and towers. 
(1)  Any antenna or tower that would otherwise be subject to regulation under the terms and provisions of this Code that had been constructed and lawfully in existence at the date of adoption of this chapter shall be deemed grandfathered and shall not be subject to the regulations provided under this Code for the issuance of a tower permit. However, all other provisions of this Code applicable to the maintenance or renovation of an antenna or tower shall be deemed applicable and in existence. 
(2)  The owner of a previously existing antenna tower shall be entitled to grandfathered status only if the owner and/or lessee of the antenna or tower shall file a declaration and claim of grandfathered status on or before the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this chapter. Any person failing to timely claim grandfathered status shall be required as a condition of the maintenance of an antenna or tower to obtain a tower permit as herein required for a newly constructed antenna or tower. 
(s)  Applicant shall acquire no vested rights. 
(1)  No applicant for a tower permit or person intending to apply for a tower permit shall at any time acquire any vested rights to a tower permit or other authority or privilege to maintain an antenna or tower in the city limits. Nor shall any person who shall have previously constructed and maintained an antenna or tower otherwise subject to regulation under this chapter be deemed to have acquired any vested rights or property rights to maintain the tower or antenna in the city. 
(2)  The city declares that the provisions of this chapter are necessary for the preservation of the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the city and as such the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the city require that this chapter and code be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and that all rights of property shall at all times be subordinate to the regulations as herein set out. 
(t)  Regulations to the extraterritorial jurisdiction. The city council finds and determines that its regulation of antennas and towers is important for the maintenance of the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the city and, as such, declares that the regulations contained in this chapter and code shall, to the extent that may from time to time be permitted under the laws of the State, be applicable to all towers and antennas that may be permitted and constructed in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city.

Sec. 10-C. - Head shops. 
(a)  Location of head shops . Subject to the granting of a specific use permit as required by this appendix A, as may be amended, all buildings and structures housing a head shop as defined herein shall be located in a zoning district that complies with the following distance requirements: 
(1)  At least 600 feet from the property boundary line of any lot or tract in a district zoned for residential uses or any lot or tract zoned for hospitals, churches or places of religious worship, public parks, or public buildings; 
(2)  At least 1,000 feet from another building or structure housing an existing head shop; and 
(3)  At least 2,500 feet from any lot or tract zoned for child care facilities, schools or institutions of higher learning. 
(b)  Distance measurements. Measurements for the above distance requirements are to be in a straight line in all directions from the building or structure housing the head shop to the nearest property line of any lot or tract in any district zoned for residential use, or any lot or tract zoned for hospitals, churches or places of religious worship, public parks, public buildings, existing head shops, child care facilities, or schools or institutions of higher learning. 
The measurements for a building or structure shall be taken from the furthest point that a building or structure extends in any direction, including overhanging roofs and all other projections or portions of said structure. 
Should a head shop be located in conjunction with other buildings or structures in a manner where the head shop is clearly separated from other portions of the building or structure, (e.g., a head shop store in a shopping center) the head shop's measurements shall be taken from the boundaries of the space in which the head shop is housed or confined (e.g., not the entire shopping center). 
Should a head shop be located in conjunction with other buildings or structures in a manner where the store is situated above the ground level of a multi-story building or structure and is clearly separate from other activities within the building or structure (e.g., a head shop store on an upper level of a multi-story retail center), the head shop's measurements shall be taken beginning from the entry to that portion of the building or structure housing the head shop, thence to the nearest point of egress (elevator or stairs), thence to the nearest ground floor exit, thence in a straight line to the nearest point on any lot or tract in a district zoned for residential use, or any lot or tract zoned for hospitals, churches or places of religious worship, public parks, public buildings, existing head shops, child care facilities, or schools or institutions of higher learning. 
(c)  Site plan . Subject to the granting of a specific use permit as required by this appendix A, as may be amended, each head shop applicant must submit a site plan setting out the dimensions and locations for such head shop. The applicant shall sign a certified and notarized statement attached to the site plan that the proposed head shop complies with the requirements set forth herein above. It shall be the applicant's duty to prepare the site plan and to assure compliance with the distance requirements imposed herein. 
(d)  Amortization . A head shop in operation prior to the effective date of this section which does not conform to the regulations pertaining to head shops shall be considered to be a nonconforming use that may continue for four months from the effective date of this section.

Sec. 11. - Nonconformities; compliance. 
A.  Policy on nonconforming uses, buildings and structures . This section shall apply to all nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures unless another superseding nonconforming regulation is otherwise adopted with respect to a particular use, building or structure. The general public is directed to take note that it is the declared purpose of this section that nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures be avoided or amortized and eliminated whenever and wherever possible, and that such nonconforming uses, buildings and structures be required to comply with the regulations adopted by this ordinance, as may be amended, except: 
1.  When the governing body determines that it is necessary to preserve property rights established prior to the date this ordinance or an amendment thereto was adopted as to the property in question; and 
2.  When the governing body determines that it is necessary to promote the general public welfare and to protect the character of the surrounding property. 
B.  Nonconforming uses . A nonconforming use that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of or amendment to this ordinance or a section thereof may be continued so long as the nonconforming use remains otherwise lawful, subject to all of the following: 
1.  No existing building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use may be enlarged, extended, constructed or reconstructed. 
2.  The use of an existing building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use that has been discontinued may be resumed only if there has been no other intervening use of the building, structure or underlying property since the nonconforming use was discontinued, and such nonconforming use was not discontinued for a period of 90 days or more. For the purpose of this section, the term "intervening use" means any other use of any kind. 
3.  A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of an otherwise lawfully existing building or structure that was obviously arranged or designed for such nonconforming use prior to the adoption or amendment of this ordinance or a section thereof, but no such nonconforming use shall be extended to any portion of the property located outside such otherwise lawfully existing building or structure. 
4.  The removal or destruction of a building or structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use resolves the nonconforming use status. For the purpose of this section, the term "destruction" means damage in an amount greater than or equal to 51 percent of the total replacement cost of the building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use at the time of its removal or destruction. Once removed or destroyed, a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use may not be rebuilt. 
5.  A nonconforming use does not terminate upon the sale or conveyance of the underlying property so long as the nonconforming use continues through and after the sale or conveyance of the underlying property in accordance with this ordinance, as amended. 
C.  Nonconforming buildings and structures . A nonconforming building or structure that lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment of this ordinance may be continued so long as the nonconforming building or structure remains otherwise lawful, subject to all of the following: 
1.  No nonconforming building or structure may be constructed, enlarged, extended, renovated, or reconstructed. 
2.  A nonconforming building or structure, or any portion thereof, may be reduced or otherwise altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity. 
3.  The use of a nonconforming building or structure that has been discontinued may be resumed only if there has been no other intervening use of the nonconforming building or structure or of the underlying property since the use of the nonconforming building or structure was discontinued, and such use was not discontinued for a period of 90 days or more. For the purpose of this section, the term "intervening use" means any other use of any kind. 
4.  No use of any kind may be extended throughout any part of a nonconforming building or structure. 
5.  The removal or destruction of a nonconforming building or structure resolves the nonconforming status. For the purpose of this section, the term "destruction" means damage in an amount greater than or equal to 51 percent of the replacement cost of the nonconforming building or structure at the time of its removal or destruction. Once removed or destroyed, a nonconforming building or structure may not be rebuilt. 
6.  A nonconforming building or structure may remain in its unaltered form upon the sale or conveyance of the underlying property so long as the nonconforming building or structure remains otherwise lawful in accordance with this ordinance, as amended. 
D.  Repairs and maintenance. For any nonconforming building or structure, or portion thereof, or any lawfully existing building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use, repairs and maintenance shall be performed to maintain the building or structure in compliance with the electrical, plumbing and building codes then adopted by the city; provided that such repairs and maintenance shall be subject to the following conditions and limitations: 
1.  Within any 12-month period, no ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-load-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed for which the cost exceeds 25 percent of the current replacement cost of the building or structure to be repaired. 
2.  If 51 percent or more of any nonconforming building or structure, or lawfully existing building or structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and it is declared by a duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, renovated or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located and in accordance with the electrical, plumbing and building codes then adopted by the city, as may be amended. 
E.  Appeal to zoning board of adjustment . Any person aggrieved by a decision made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance may appeal to the zoning board of adjustment for the granting of a special exception to authorize the extension or continuation of a nonconforming use, building or structure pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.010. Upon hearing an appeal hereunder as provided by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.009, the zoning board of adjustment shall determine whether the applicant has been afforded a reasonable time in which to recover investments made in the nonconforming use, building or structure. If the zoning board of adjustment determines that the applicant has not been afforded a reasonable period in which to recover an investment in the nonconforming use, building or structure, the zoning board of adjustment shall establish an additional amortization period in accordance with the subsection below. 
F.  Determination of amortization period . The date upon which any building, structure or use first becomes nonconforming shall mark the beginning of its amortization period. The following factors shall be considered by the zoning board of adjustment in initially determining a reasonable amortization period: 
1.  The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment, and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly transferred to another site) located on or used in conjunction with the property before the time the use, building or structure became nonconforming. 
2.  Any costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of a compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation expenses, termination of leases, discharge of mortgages, or otherwise deemed to be relevant in the discretion of the board of adjustment. 
3.  Any return on investment since the inception of the use, or construction of the building(s) or structure(s), including, but not limited to, net income and depreciation. 
4.  The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including, but not limited to, net income and depreciation. 
G.  Compliance requirement . If the zoning board of adjustment finds that an applicant is entitled to additional time to amortize an investment hereunder, it shall establish a compliance date for the nonconforming use, building or structure, which compliance date shall be the date by which the nonconforming use shall cease operations, or by which the nonconforming building or structure shall be removed or made to comply. It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to cease any nonconforming use, or fail to remove any nonconforming building or structure, or nonconforming part thereof, on or before a compliance date established by the board of adjustment.

Sec. 13. - Planned unit development (PUD). 
A.  Purpose. It is the general purpose of the PUD district classification to: 
1.  Encourage enhancement and preservation of lands which are unique or of outstanding scenic, environmental, cultural and historical significance; 
2.  Provide an alternative for more efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities, safer network of streets, promoting greater opportunities for public and private open space, and resulting in lower construction and maintenance costs to the general public; 
3.  Encourage harmonious and coordinated development of the site, considering the natural features, community facilities, pedestrian and vehicular circulation in conformance with the thoroughfare plan, and land use relationship with surrounding properties and the general area; and 
4.  Require the application of professional planning and design techniques to achieve overall coordinated development, eliminating the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development likely to result from rigid adherence to the zoning classifications and standards found elsewhere in this article. 
B.  Eligibility. The foregoing general purposes and comprehensive plan elements, along with such standards provided in this article, shall guide in the determination of eligibility for PUD application. 
C.  PUD designation procedure. The process for the filing of an application, requirements for notice and advertisement of a PUD application and other related actions shall be the same as those provided for in the zoning amendment process. In addition to the above, the applicant shall be governed by the following requirements: 
1.  Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting an application for approval of a PUD, the applicant or representative shall confer with the building official. The applicant is encouraged to submit a tentative land use sketch for review and to obtain any information on any projected plans, programs or other matters that may affect the proposed development. This information should include the:

(Ord. No. 14-2013, § 2, 3-11-13; Ord. No. 21-2017 , § 2(Exh. A), 12-18-17) 
Sec. 17. - Board of adjustment. 
A.  The city council is hereby authorized to act as a board of adjustment, unless it should by resolution establish a board of adjustment, and until such time as a board of adjustment is established by the city council, all decisions by the city council, while acting as a board of adjustment, shall be final and subject only to judicial review as provided in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011. 
B.  The board of adjustment when and if appointed by city council shall consist of five members who are property owners in the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas, each to be appointed for term of two years and removable for cause by the city council upon written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. 
C.  The board by majority vote shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board or the city manager may determine necessary. Such chairman or in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public in accordance with V.T.C.A., Government Code Chapter 551. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. The concurring vote of 75 percent of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any ordinance, or to affect any variation in such ordinance. 
D.  Appeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas, affected by any decision of the building inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and by paying a filing fee to the city secretary of the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas, at the time the notice is filed, which shall be credited to the general funds of the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken if due cause is shown. 
The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. 
E.  The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
1.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or interpretation of the text of this ordinance. 
2.  Hear and decide requests for variances from the terms of this ordinance as follows: 
a.  Purpose. Variances are deviations from the property development standards for the applicable zoning district where development is proposed that would not be contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this ordinance is observed and substantial justice done. A variance cannot be requested for a change in land use. 
b.  Authority. The board of adjustment, in accordance with the procedures, standards and limitations of this section, shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove an application for a variance permit after receiving a recommendation by the city manager. 
c.  Initiation. An application for a variance permit shall be submitted by a qualified applicant. 
d.  Procedure. 
i.  Submission of application. A complete application for a variance permit shall be submitted to the city secretary, along with a nonrefundable fee that is established from time to time by the city council to defray the actual cost of processing the application. No application shall be processed until the established fee has been paid and the application has been determined completed by the city secretary. 
ii.  Review and recommendation by city manager. After determining that the application is complete, the city manager shall review the application and prepare a staff report, which may include a recommendation of approval, approval with conditions or disapproval based upon the criteria in subsection e. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the applicant at least five days prior to the public hearing on the application. 
iii.  Public hearing. After due notice, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance permit. At the public hearing the board of adjustment shall consider the application, the staff report, the relevant supporting materials and the public testimony given at the public hearing. After the close of the public hearing, the board of adjustment shall vote to approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the application for a variance permit pursuant to the criteria of subsection e. 
iv.  Notice of decision. The city secretary shall provide a copy of the decision to the applicant by mail within ten days of the board's decision. 
e.  Criteria. To approve an application for a variance permit, the board of adjustment shall make an affirmative finding that the following criteria are met: 
i.  Special circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same zoning district and are not merely financial; 
ii.  These special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; 
iii.  Literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other land in the same zoning district, and would cause an unnecessary and undue hardship; 
iv.  Granting the variance is the minimum action that will make possible the use of the land or structure which is not contrary to the public interest, and which would carry out the spirit of this ordinance and substantial justice; 
v.  Granting the variance will not adversely affect adjacent land in a material way; and 
vi.  Granting the variance will be generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this ordinance. 
f.  Effect of variance permit. 
i.  Generally. Issuance of a variance permit shall authorize only the particular variation which is approved in the variance permit. A variance permit shall run with the land. 
ii.  Time limit. Unless otherwise specified in the variance permit, an application to commence construction of the improvements that were the subject of the variance permit request must be applied for and approved within 12 months of the date of the approval of the variance permit, otherwise the variance permit shall automatically become null and void. Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners. Upon written request, only one extension of the 12-month timeframe may be granted by the board of adjustment for a period not to exceed 12 months for good cause shown. 
3.  Special exceptions. When, in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially or permanently injured, the board of adjustment may in a specific case, after public notice and hearing and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, permit special exceptions authorized by the regulations contained herein and as follows: 
a.  To permit a transitional use between a business or industrial district and dwelling district where the side of a lot in a single-family district or a two-family district abuts upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes as follows: On a lot in a single-family dwelling district, which sides on a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes, the board may permit a two-family dwelling. 
b.  Grant in undeveloped sections of the city temporary and conditional permits for not more than two years. The granting or existence of such temporary or conditional permit shall not be reason or cause for extension of such permit. 
c.  Permit such modification of yard open space, lot area or lot width regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a parcel of land if such parcel is separately owned at the time of the original passage of this ordinance or subsequent annexation of the city and is of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without such modification. 
d.  To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height or area regulation into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district divided a lot in a single ownership at the time of the adoption of this ordinance. 
e.  To permit as an accessory use a parking area for passenger automobiles on a lot or lots in a single-family, duplex, or apartment house district adjoining or across a street of not more than 50 feet in width from any residential district, subject, however, to the following provisions: 
i.  The area shall be properly enclosed with a hedge, screen, fence, wall or other suitable enclosure having a height of not less than three feet nor more than six feet. Such fence or enclosure shall conform to the front yard regulations of the district in which it is located. 
ii.  The area shall be paved. 
iii.  No parking of vehicles shall be permitted within six feet of any adjoining lot on which is located a single-family residence, duplex or multiple dwelling. 
iv.  One sign, not exceeding two and one-half square feet in area, may be erected identifying the lot. 
v.  No charges may be made for parking and no other business use may be made of the lot. 
vi.  Any light used to illuminate said parking area shall be so arranged as to direct the light away from any adjoining lot used for residential purposes. 
g.  Permit the reconstruction of a building occupied by a nonconforming use, or permit the extension of a nonconforming use of a building upon the lot occupied by such use or building at the time of the passage of this ordinance. 
h.  Permit the location of sexually oriented businesses subject to the standards listed in chapter 18 entitled "Businesses" and notwithstanding any other licensing requirements contained in the Code of Ordinances of the City of Oak Ridge North and imposed by state law. 
4.  Reserved. 
5.  Any appeal or permit granted by the board of adjustment shall not be valid if construction authorized by said permit is not begun within a period of 60 days. 
a.  In exercising the above-mentioned powers such board may, in conformity with the provisions of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
b.  In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this ordinance, the board shall, before making any finding, in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not constitute any change in the district map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase the congestion in public streets or increase the public danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City of Oak Ridge North, Texas. 
c.  Every variation granted or denied by the board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on sworn testimony and evidence, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variation.
