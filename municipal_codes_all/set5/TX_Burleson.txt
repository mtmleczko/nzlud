PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Burleson, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through April 10, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, Vicki L. Ward, Technical Editor and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 149. - Interim municipal government.

Sec. 150. - Submission of the Charter to electors. 
    The Charter commission in preparing this Charter finds that it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function it is necessary that it should be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons the Charter commission directs that the said Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Burleson at the regular election to be held on April 5, 1969. If a majority of the qualified voters voting in such election shall vote in favor of the adoption of this Charter, it shall become the Charter of the City of Burleson, and after the returns have been canvassed, the same shall be declared adopted. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to such election the city council shall cause the city secretary to mail a copy of this Charter to each qualified voter of the City of Burleson as appears from the tax collector's roll for the year ending January thirty-first preceding said election. 
    An official copy of the Charter shall be filed with the records of the city, and the mayor shall, as soon as practicable, certify to the secretary of state an authenticated copy under the seal of the city, showing the approval by the qualified voters of such Charter. 
    All elective officers under this Charter shall be voted on as prescribed by Article III, section 19 hereof, and the candidates therefor shall be governed by this Charter and take office as herein provided, until which time the present officers of the City of Burleson shall continue in office and constitute the city council of the City of Burleson.

ARTICLE XIII. - DANGEROUS AND SUBSTANDARD BUILDINGS 

Sec. 10-451. - Findings, purpose, and scope. 
(a)  Findings. There exist in the city, buildings used for residential and nonresidential purposes that are substandard in structure and maintenance. Inadequate light and air, insufficient protection against fire, lack of proper heating, and unsanitary conditions constitute a menace to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The existence of such conditions will create slum and blighted areas requiring large scale clearance if not remedied. Furthermore, in the absence of corrective measures, areas will experience a deterioration of social values, impairment of property values, and a curtailment of investment and tax revenue. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of the city by establishing minimum standards applicable to residential and nonresidential buildings. Minimum standards are established with respect to property, building structure, utilities, and health, which are essential to make buildings safe, sanitary, and fit for human use and habitation. Demolition is provided as a last resort when compliance with standards cannot reasonably be achieved. 
(c)  Scope. The provisions of this article apply to all buildings within the city whether in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or constructed afterward.

b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the city council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections.

In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city secretary with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the city council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city council determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the city council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution.

(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the city council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and

If the city council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city council's decision concerning the requested rate increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved, in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the city secretary to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.

Sec. 14-194. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the city council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, shall not be considered.

The city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city council, the information will be made available for public inspection.

Sec. 14-195. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect.

(d)  The operator shall hold a public meeting with the owners of real property within 1,000 feet of the wellhead and within 200 feet of any non-public or unpaved portion of the transportation route. The purpose of the meeting is to give residents and property owners an opportunity to review information related to the gas drilling permit request and to ask questions about the project or gas drilling in general. The meeting shall be held in the city limits. The operator shall be responsible for notice of the public meeting to the property owners, arranging for a meeting place and conducting the meeting. Each of these notices shall include the date, time and place of the meeting and must be made at least ten days prior to the meeting. The operator shall notify the city manager and gas well inspector of the date, time and place of the meeting at least one week prior to the meeting date. A summary of the meeting and the sign-in sheet for the meeting shall be submitted to the city manager within three days after the meeting. 
(e)  The city council shall conduct a public hearing for all gas well permit applications with a gas well ordinance variance request letter, and other gas well permit applications determined by the city manager to require council approval at a regularly scheduled meeting date. The city manager shall give notice of a public hearing, and notice of public hearing shall be provided in accordance with the provisions below.

In cases where ownership information provided with the permit application differs from the approved tax roll, notice shall be given to all parties. 
(f)  The city manager or city council may approve the gas well permit subject to terms and conditions as it determines to be necessary to protect the public health and safety. For existing pad sites, all requirements imposed for previous permits on the subject pad site shall be required for all subsequent wells on that pad site unless approved by variance by the city council. 
(g)  In making its decision, the city manager or city council shall, in addition to other considerations, have the power and authority to deny any permit to drill any well at any particular location within the city based on any of the following findings: 
(1)  It is determined that drilling at a particular location may constitute a hazard to residences, commercial activities, schools, hospitals, parks, and civic purposes existing in the area surrounding the proposed drill site. 
(2)  It is determined that drilling at a particular location may be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare of the city.

DIVISION 3. - INSURANCE, BOND AND INDEMNITY 

Sec. 14-361. - Bond, indemnity, insurance. 
(a)  General requirements. The operator shall: 
(1)  Comply with the terms and conditions of this article and the gas well permit issued hereunder. 
(2)  Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, causes of action, suits and liability of every kind, including all expenses of litigation, court costs, and attorney's fees, for injury to or death of any person or for damage to any property arising out of or in connection with the work done by operator under a gas well permit: 
a.  Where such injuries, death or damages are caused by operator's sole negligence or the joint negligence of operator and any other person or entity; and 
b.  Regardless of whether such injuries, death or damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence of operator. 
(3)  Promptly pay all fines, penalties and other assessments imposed due to breach of any terms of the gas well permit. 
(4)  Promptly restore to its former condition any public property damaged by the gas operation. 
(b)  Bond. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a gas well permit the operator shall provide the city manager with a security instrument in the form of a bond. The bond shall be executed through a company duly approved to transact that class of instrument in the State of Texas and acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the gas well permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the city. The original bond shall be submitted to the city manager. 
(2)  Bond for single well. The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a $50,000.00 bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this article and whose well in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, may submit a request to the city manager for approval to reduce the existing bond to $15,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond shall be maintained at $50,000.00. 
(3)  Blanket bond for multiple wells. An operator drilling or reworking between one and five wells at any given time may elect to provide a blanket bond in the principal minimum amount of $150,000.00. If the operator drills or reworks more than five wells at a time, the blanket bond shall be increased in increments of $50,000.00 per each additional well. Once the wells are in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, the operator may elect to submit a request to the city manager for approval to reduce the existing bond and provide a blanket bond of $75,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces, without reworking. 
(4)  Whenever the city manager finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this article, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the city manager to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. 
(5)  The city shall be authorized to draw against any bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
(6)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(7)  When the well or wells covered by said bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled. 
(c)  Insurance. In addition to the bond required pursuant to this article, the operator shall carry a policy or policies of insurance issued by an insurance company or companies authorized to do business in Texas. In the event such insurance policy or policies are cancelled, the gas well permit shall be suspended on such date of cancellation and the operator's right to operate under such gas well permit shall immediately cease until the operator files additional insurance as provided herein.

ARTICLE V. - NOISE[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. CSO#129-01-2015 , § 1), adopted Jan. 20, 2015, amended Art. V in its entirety. Former Art. V, §§ 34-191, 34-192, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1983, §§ 12-7, 12-8; Ord. No. B-545, § 1, adopted Sept. 8, 1994; Ord. No. B573, § I, adopted June 27, 1996; Ord. No. B-749-06, § 2, adopted April 13, 2006; Ord. No. B-758-06, §§ 1, 2, adopted Sept. 28, 2006. 

Sec. 34-191. - Noise. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish a set of uniform regulations governing noise and sound generated by human activities. These regulations are intended to ensure that a manmade noise does not become a nuisance by its volume, frequency, duration or vibration to such an extent that it becomes a nuisance and negatively impacts other citizens and adjoining property owners. 
(2)  Scope. This article applies to the control of all sound and noise within the corporate limits of the City of Burleson and for noises that constitute a public nuisance shall extend to an area lying within 5,000 feet outside the boundaries of the city as permitted pursuant to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 217.042. 
(3)  Standard of determination. A noise or sound will be determined to be a nuisance as such time as it becomes disturbing to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities at the property line of the complainant. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from all sources at the location, constituting the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location. 
    A-weighting (dBA) means the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighted network. The level so read is designated dB(A) or dBA. 
    Bounding real property line means an imaginary line at the ground at its vertical extension that separates the real property owned or occupied by one person from that owned or occupied by another person. 
    Decibel (dBA) means the unit of measurement for sound pressure at a specified location. 
    Governmental function means work conducted by a governmental entity in the interest of the community. 
    Residential means property zoned for residential use in accordance with the city's zoning ordinance. 
    Sound level means the instantaneous sound pressure level measured in decibels obtained by the use of a sound level meter for A-weighting on slow integration speed, unless otherwise noted. 
    Unreasonable noise means: 
(1)  Any unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise which causes material distress, discomfort or injury to persons of ordinary sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof; or 
(2)  Any noise of such character, intensity and continued duration, which substantially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of private homes by persons of ordinary sensibilities. 
(c)  Presumptive threshold restrictions on maximum decibel levels. 
(1)  Maximum sound levels. During the times in the zoning districts set forth below, activities that create a sound pressure level on the complainant's bounding real property line that exceed the maximum allowable sound level (dBA) are presumed to be public nuisances: 
Within or directly adjacent to a zoning district zoned (A) agricultural, SFE single-family residential estate, SF16 single-family dwelling district 16, SF10 single-family dwelling district 10, SF7 single-family dwelling district 7, SFA single-family attached dwelling district, 2F two-family dwelling district, MF1 multi-family 1 dwelling district, MF2 multi-family 2 dwelling district, MH manufactured housing dwelling district, or MHP manufactured housing park district: 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. equal to or less than 70 dBA 
Nighttime: 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., equal to or less than 60 dBA 
All commercial zoning districts, including the NS neighborhood service district, GR general retail district and C commercial district: 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. equal to or less than 80 dBA 
Nighttime: 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. equal to or less than 70 dBA 
The industrial zoning district: 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. equal to or less than 85 dBA 
Nighttime: 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. equal to or less than 75 dBA 
Site plan or planned development districts (SP or PD) shall be analyzed to determine the majority percentage of land use within that unique zoning district. The sound decibel levels applicable to the base land use category that constitutes the largest percentage of land area within that special district shall be the controlling decibel limit. 
In the Old Town (OT) overlay district the area zoned C.C. (central commercial): 
Sunday-Thursday 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. = 80 dBA 
Nighttime: 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. = 70 dBA 
Friday-Saturday 
Daytime: 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. the following day = 85 dBA 
Nighttime and Sunday: 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. = 70 dBA 
All zoning where ambient noise level exceeds the prescribed maximum level: 
7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. = Existing Ambient (dBA) + 3 dBA 
10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. = Existing Ambient (dBA) 
(2)  Method of noise measurement. Noise measurement shall be a minimum of 30 seconds in duration. Decibel levels are measured from the complainant's property line. For residential districts adjacent to other districts (excluding industrial zoning districts), the residential decibel levels apply when measured from a residential complainant's property line. Violations will be determined based on the highest registered reading in the measurement. All measurement levels will be inclusive of any ambient noise that exists at the time of the measurement. 
(3)  Noise generated outside the corporate limits of the city. The City of Burleson has established a series of maximum noise level restrictions in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and residents of the city. Noise does not follow boundaries but travels in such a manner as to trespass upon the rights of other residents or property owners living or working in close proximity to the noise generation. V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 217.042 grants a home rule city the right to restrict noise that may rise to the level of a public nuisance outside the corporation limits of the city for a distance of up to 5,000 feet. The City of Burleson hereby declares that the generation of noise at a decibel level equal to or greater than 85 (dBA) shall be considered a public nuisance if it is generated within 5,000 feet outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Burleson. Noise violations that occur outside the limits of the city but within 5,000 feet of its boundary may be enforced by citation through the Burleson Municipal Court or by such other means as the judge of the municipal court may deem appropriate following proper notice and hearing. 
(d)  Sound or noise prohibited. 
(1)  In addition to the other noise restrictions in this section, no person shall make, cause, suffer, allow or permit unreasonable noise in such a manner, or with such volume, intensity, vibration or duration, so as to disturb a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities. A decibel level shall not be required for the enforcement of this subsection. 
(2)  This subsection is intended to apply to, but is not limited to, unreasonable noises in the form of: 
a.  Amplifiers in public ROW and on city property. The use of a bullhorn, loudspeaker, or other amplification is prohibited in the public right-of-way and on City of Burleson property, unless permitted as an exception below. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Public safety officials while performing their duties. 
2.  Persons with an outdoor event permit secured under the provisions of Ordinance B-805-13 of the Burleson City Code. 
3.  Persons with express permission given by the city manager or a city department head or designee. 
b.  Animals. It shall be unlawful to keep, or to permit the keeping of, any dog(s), or rooster(s), or any other bird or animal that creates any bark, cry, crow, or other sound on a frequent, repetitive or continuous basis for ten minutes or longer. 
c.  Construction work. Noise created by construction work within 300 feet of an occupied residential structure involving the erection, excavation, demolition, alternation, or repair of any building, structure, flatwork or public works facility, is prohibited as follows: 
Before 7:00 a.m. or after 8:00 p.m. Monday-Friday 
Before 9:00 a.m. or after 8:00 p.m. on Saturday-Sunday 
Unless expressly authorized by the city manager or his designee to meet a site specific construction requirement. 
d.  Music. The playing of any music or musical instrument in such manner or with such volume or base (particularly during the nighttime hours described in subsection (c) restriction on decibel levels above) as to annoy or to disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of persons of ordinary sensibilities in any dwelling, hotel or other type of residence. 
e.  Horns or other signal devices. The continued or frequent sounding of any horn, air horn, or signal device on any vehicle except as a danger or warning signals; the creation by means of any such signal device of an unreasonably loud or harsh noise for any unnecessary and unreasonable period of time. 
f.  Operation of motor vehicles. The revving of any engine, the playing of any music with such volume or bass, or the operation of any vehicle so out of repair, so loaded or in such a manner as to create loud or unnecessary grating, grinding, jarring, rattling, or squealing noise or vibrations. 
g.  The blowing of any steam whistle attached to any stationary boiler, except to give notice of the time to begin or stop work or as a warning of danger. 
h.  The discharge into the open air of the exhaust of any steam engine, stationary internal combustion engine, motor vehicle, or boat engine, except through a muffler or other device which will effectively prevent loud or explosive noises. 
i.  The use of any mechanical device operated by compressed air, unless the noise created is effectively muffled and reduced. 
j.  The creation of any excessive noise on a street adjacent to a school or institution of learning, while such school or institution of learning is in session, or adjacent to a hospital, which unreasonably interferes with the workings of such institutions, provided conspicuous signs are displayed in a manner indicating that the street is a school or hospital street. 
k.  The creation of any loud and excessive noise in connection with the loading or unloading of any vehicle or the opening and destruction of bales, boxes, crates, and containers. 
l.  The raucous shouting and crying of peddlers, hawkers and vendors which disturbs the peace and quiet of a neighborhood. 
m.  The use of any bell, drum, loud speaker, whistle or other instrument or device for the purpose of attracting attention by the creation of noise to any performance, show, or sale of merchandise; except for ice cream vendors between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and dusk. 
n.  The parking or storage between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. of any motor vehicle, with any motor affixed thereto, left in operation, for a period in excess of one hour, within a distance of 200 feet from any dwelling. 
(e)  Exemptions. The following acts and sounds shall be exempt from the requirements of this section: 
(1)  Noise generated due to normal building conditioning, ventilation and property maintenance. 
(2)  Noise generated on public and/or public school property, if permitted and authorized by the public entity owning the property. 
(3)  Noise generated by an outdoor event that has been issued a special event permit pursuant to section 70-146. 
(4)  Noise generated by any governmental body and its contractors in the performance of a governmental function. 
(5)  Noise generated by airport, railway and vehicular transportation engaged in their traditional and customary operations. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the exemptions enumerated above, if any sound or noise is generated by a governmental entity or unit over which the City of Burleson exercises control, the city and its personnel shall make every reasonable effort to limit or manage the noise generated to limit its negative impact on adjoining properties. The exemption granted governmental entities above is provided based upon the fact that the governmental entities are performing public service functions on behalf of all of the citizens within their jurisdiction and frequently must be undertaken at times and under conditions intended to minimize disruption of traffic and other community activities. 
(f)  Enforcement. The provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall be enforced by the city manager or his or her designee. The provision of subsection (d) of this section may be enforced through the municipal court by a written complaint filed by any citizen. 
(g)  Continuing violations constituting a public nuisance. If an individual or business is convicted of three violations of the noise ordinance within any 60-day period, or if a business or individual are the subject of six complaints made within a 90-day period, a presumption will exist that a public nuisance is being created. 
    This presumption shall permit the city attorney to file an action in municipal court seeking a determination as to whether a public nuisance exists. The decision as to whether to seek such a determination shall be a discretionary decision of the city attorney based upon a cumulative review of the facts and circumstances of the complaints. 
    In order to support a finding, based solely upon complaints without conviction, it will be necessary to present evidence that efforts have been made to serve a notice of violation, or citation on the business or individual who is alleged to have violated the noise ordinance. Evidence must be presented that notice of violation was mailed to the last known address of the alleged violator through the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the business or individual alleged to have committed the violations. If no evidence exists that the business or individual accepted service or delivery of the notice of violation, then evidence must be presented that in addition to attempts to achieve contact through the United States Postal Service, affidavits must be provided showing that notice of violation or complaint were posted on the business or residence by a public official in a prominently visible location on the apparent main entrance to the business or residence during normal working hours on at least one occasion for each notice of violation or citation. 
    If the apparent public nuisance evidence set forth above is in the possession of city officials they are authorized to present a request to the municipal court for a determination that the ongoing evidence of continued violation of the noise ordinance constitutes a public nuisance and requests a hearing for a determination and ruling on such motion. The municipal court will give proper notice to any and all affected parties and schedule a hearing on the motion to determine the existence of a public nuisance at the subject property. If the city presents sufficient evidence that a continuing noise nuisance has occurred and/or if the alleged offending business or individual fails to respond to the notice of hearing and appear before the court to explain their actions, the court may enter an order finding that a public nuisance exists. 
    Notice of such findings shall be transmitted to the property owner or individual against whom the public nuisance complaint has been lodged by mail and by personal delivery at the business or site where the alleged noise offense is occurring. If the property owner should then fail to take action to abate the nuisance, the city attorney shall so advise the municipal court. The municipal court judge shall then determine the appropriate method to insure compliance utilizing the contempt remedies available to the court. 
(h)  Penalties. 
(1)  A person commits an offense if the person makes noise in violation of this article. 
(2)  An offense under this section is punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000.00, for each event or violation. 
(3)  Each occurrence of a violation, or, in the case of multiple violations, each day a violation occurs or continues, constitutes a separate offense and may be punished separately. 
(4)  Any individual violation of this section may constitute a nuisance based upon the specific circumstances. The prosecution of an offense under this article does not limit the city's right to abate the nuisance, including the use of injunctive or other civil relief.

(b)  The designated groundwater beneath CB-MSD-0001 is shallow, perched groundwater. Groundwater at the site is perched within a thin layer of residual soils above the underlying Grayson Marl Formation. The unweathered Grayson Marl Formation is approximately 60 to 100 feet thick and mostly consists of yellowish-gray and medium gray clay and marl (calcereous shale) with some thin limestone beds. The vertical extent of contamination is limited to the groundwater begin unit (GWBU) present at depths ranging from approximately eight to 15 feet below ground surface (BGS). The GWBU is underlain by aquitards of the Washita and Fredericksburg Groups with an approximate combined thickness of 470 feet. These aquitards inhibit the downward migration of contamination into the underlying aquitards. 
(c)  The following contaminants have been detected within the designated groundwater at the site at concentrations exceeding residential assessment levels for potable use: 
* Benzene 
* 1,2-Dichloroethane 
* Ethylbenzene 
* Naphthalene 
* Toluene 
* 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene 
* m-,p-Xylenes 
(d)  The use of the designated groundwater in CB-MSD-0001 for potable and irrigation purposes is hereby prohibited. This prohibition is necessary because the contaminant concentrations exceed potable water standards. 
(e)  the city will provide advance written notice to the state commission on environmental quality, as much as is practicable, prior to enacting an ordinance repealing or amending this section. 
(f)  That all ordinances or any parts thereof in conflict with the terms of this section shall be and hereby are deemed repealed and of no force or effect; provided, however, that any ordinance or ordinances under which cases are currently filed and pending in the city municipal court, shall be deemed repealed only when all such cases filed and pending under such ordinance or ordinances have been disposed of by a final conviction, a finding of not guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, or dismissal.

(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1983, § 5-121; Ord. No. B-432, § 1, 5-14-1987) 
Sec. 42-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Sec. 42-34. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar land form below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Appeal board means the board of adjustment created in the zoning ordinance number B-582, printed as appendix B to this Code. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within the community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 through 99. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    City engineer means that person or group of persons or consultants or any employee thereof who has been appointed as city engineer, or authorized designee, in accordance with Ordinance No. C-153 or as such ordinance may be amended. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in zones A1 through 30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers) or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water, and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1 through 30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwater. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition or partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the areas within the boundaries of special flood hazards have been designated as zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths or associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of Flood or flooding ). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program or corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for the following purposes, which include working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a habitable floor. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminary determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designated and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including the basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, however, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means and shall include mobile homes and HUD code manufactured homes as defined in appendix B, zoning ordinance, section 12, "special definitions and explanations". For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park means a unified development of local manufactured housing spaces arranged on a large tract or site under single ownership, meeting all requirements of chapter 9, manufactured homes and travel trailers, and designed to accommodate manufactured houses for either a temporary or permanent duration. 
    Manufactured home subdivision means a unified development of manufactured housing sites on lots platted for such purposes, which lots may be sold to the owners of manufactured houses situated thereof, meeting the area and yard requirements of the zoning ordinance and designed to accommodate manufactured houses on a permanent basis. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicles means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis; 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date of the building permit (or first building permit for a succession of building permits) was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Any building permit issued that causes the total cumulative value of all improvements to exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the issuance of the first building permit will be classified as a substantial improvement. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), or (d)(3), (NFIP regulations) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(5)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with section 42-61(b)(1). 
(b)  Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this article and the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(8)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(9)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area.

Sec. 42-64. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement of administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 42-63(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 42-33). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that criteria outlined in subsections (a)-(i) of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 42-91. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding i.e., waste disposal systems shall not be located within a floodplain; floodway area. 
(Code 1983, § 5-136; Ord. No. B-432, § 1, 5-14-1987; Ord. No. B-502, § I, 8-22-1991) 
Sec. 42-92. - Specific standards. 
    In all of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in sections 42-37, 42-61(8), or 42-93(d), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floors (including the basement) elevated to at least three feet above the base flood elevation as designated in the FIRM or two feet above the ultimate (fully-developed) water surface elevation as determined by a flood study prepared by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. A licensed professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated to at least three feet above the base flood elevation as designated in the FIRM or two feet above the ultimate (fully-developed) water surface elevation as determined by a flood study prepared by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. In the alternative, the building, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, may be designed so that below the base flood level, plus three feet, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed area below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least three feet above the base flood elevation as designated in the FIRM or two feet above the ultimate (fully-developed) water surface elevation as determined by a flood study prepared by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. A licensed professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection is satisfied. 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM either be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the permit requirements of section 42-63(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Code 1983, § 5-137; Ord. No. B-432, § 1, 5-14-1987; Ord. No. B-502, § I, 8-22-1991; Ord. No. B-559, § I, 8-10-1995; Ord. No. B-559(A1008), § VIII, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 42-93. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections 42-32, 42-33 and 42-36. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development permit requirements of section 42-61-42-63 and the provisions of sections 42-91-42-95.

(e)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Code 1983, § 5-138; Ord. No. B-432, § 1, 5-14-1987; Ord. No. B-559(A1008), § IX, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 42-94. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-42 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number plus three feet as specified in feet on the FIRM or at least two feet above the ultimate (fully-developed) water surface elevation as determined by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. This requirement will also apply to manufactured homes. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number, plus three feet, as specified on the FIRM or at least two feet above the water surface elevation as determined by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water to an elevation three feet above the depth number as designated in the FIRM or two feet above the ultimate (fully-developed) water surface elevation as determined by a flood study prepared by a licensed engineer, whichever is higher. The structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this article, as proposed in section 42-63(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1983, § 5-139; Ord. No. B-432, § 1, 5-14-1987; Ord. No. B-559(A1008), § X, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 42-95. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-42 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvement shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revisions through FEMA.

Sec. 44-58. - Land use assumptions. 
    Land use assumptions used in the development of the impact fees are contained in exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. These assumptions may be revised by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.08) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-59. - Service units. 
(a)  Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  Service units shall be calculated based on living units equivalent as determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development; or alternatively, as approved by the city manager as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of LUEs of service for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter. 
(c)  If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the number of LUEs shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Said reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of LUEs. 
(1)  The meter types used to calculate the number of LUEs shall be either simple or compound meters. 
(2)  If the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the property shall be assessed the then-current fee for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(3)  To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the city, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county. 
(4)  No fees shall be collected for the purchase of taps which shall be utilized to provide only fire protection capacity. 
(d)  Upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas and shall be reviewed by the city manager, who shall designate the appropriate number of service units. 
(e)  The city council may revise the service units designation according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.09) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-60. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for each conceptual service area shall be computed by subtracting 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, and dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the conceptual service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the conceptual service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that conceptual service area. Maximum impact fees per service unit for each conceptual service area are established by category of capital improvements and are set forth in exhibit C attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference. 
(b)  Exhibit C may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(c)  The effective impact fees per service unit, shown in exhibit C to this article, may be amended from time to time by the city council, through ordinance amendment, to any amount equal to or less than the maximum fees set forth in exhibit C to this article. The effective impact fees are shown in exhibit C of this article. 
(d)  In accordance with Section 395.014(a)(7) of the Local Government Code, the capital improvements plans (exhibits D and E) have included a credit equal to 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvements plans, and the credit was applied to such projected costs prior to calculation of the maximum and effective impact fees shown in exhibit C of this article. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.10) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-61. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land or of any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the impact fee applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of the initial ordinance, on November 15, 2005, assessment shall be at the time of recording the final subdivision plat with the county clerk and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect, as provided in exhibit C as set forth in subsection 44-60(c). The city may provide the subdivider with a copy of exhibit C prior to final subdivision plat approval, but providing such copy shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this article. 
(2)  For new development for which a final subdivision plat was recorded with the county clerk prior to November 15, 2005, and for which no replatting is necessary prior to the issuance of a building permit, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit (or upon issuance of a water or sewer tap for properties outside the Burleson city limits), and shall be the value of the effective impact fee per service unit in effect November 15, 2005. 
(3)  For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit (or upon issuance of a water or sewer tap for properties outside the Burleson city limits), and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit set forth in exhibit C. 
(4)  For properties with existing taps that were purchased prior to November 15, 2005, owners may exchange those purchased taps for taps which will reflect an equivalent number of LUEs, as determined under section 44-59. If the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of LUEs, the purchaser shall be assessed the maximum impact fee in effect at the time of tap exchange, based on the additional LUEs required. 
(5)  Water demand related solely to landscape irrigation demand shall be assessed a water impact fee, but shall not be assessed a sewer impact fee. 
(6)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to assessment of an impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property shall be assessed the impact fees currently in effect at the time such conversion is established by the city for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(c)  Following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth under section 44-59. 
(d)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.11) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-62. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Following the request for new development as provided in section 44-61 of this article, the city shall compute impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The total service units for the new development shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit current effective fee value determined as set forth in section 44-60; and 
(2)  The maximum amount payable shall be capped at the assessment amount calculated as set forth in section 44-61 of this article; and 
(3)  Fee credits and offsets shall be subtracted as determined by the process proscribed in section 44-65 of this article. 
(b)  The value of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed a value computed by multiplying the effective fee assessed per service unit pursuant to section 44-60 by the number of service units generated by the development. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.12) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-63. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  No water or wastewater tap or building permit shall be issued until all impact fees due have been paid to the city, or until a "notice of impact fee due" is recorded as provided in this section, except as provided otherwise by contract. 
(b)  Effective impact fees, as shown in exhibit C of this article, shall be paid at the time of the issuance of a building permit, except as provided in subsection (c) through subsection (f) of this section. 
(c)  For land platted outside the corporate boundaries of the city, fees shall be collected at the time an application for connection to the city's water or wastewater system is filed. 
(d)  If the city lacks authority to issue building permits in the area where the impact fee applies, impact fees shall be collected at the time an application is filed for connection to the city's water or wastewater system. 
(e)  The city may, at its sole discretion, enter into contracts to establish a different date of fee collection than those provided in this section. 
(f)  It shall be the policy of the city to attempt to revise any contracts which might exist with wholesale customers, or which in the future may be entered into for wholesale service, in such a manner that impact fees are collected from the wholesale customer according to the number of LUEs attributable to each retail meter for new development within the wholesale customer's service area. 
(g)  The City of Burleson shall collect City of Fort Worth impact fees at the same time as but in addition to City of Burleson impact fees. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.13) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-64. - Suspension of fee collection. 
(a)  This section is no longer applicable. There is no suspension of fee collection. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.14) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-65. - Offsets and credits against impact fees. 
(a)  Pursuant to rules established in this section, the city may offset 50 percent of the value of any system-related facilities which have been dedicated to and received by the city without city participation in the cost thereof, including the value of rights-of-way or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the value of the impact fees due for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the conceptual service area for which the impact fee is imposed. 
(3)  If an offset or credit applicable to a plat or development has not been exhausted within ten years from the date of the issuance of the first building permit after the effective date of this article or within such period as may be otherwise designated by contract, such offset or credit shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this article or for any value exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(c)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation, or if development is to occur without platting, at or before issuance of a building permit (or at or before issuance of a water or sewer tap for properties outside the Burleson city limits). The applicant shall file a petition for offsets or credits with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset or credit which may be applied against an impact fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(d)  The available offset or credit associated with the plat or development shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset or credit shall be prorated equally among all service units, as calculated in section 44-59, and remain applicable to such service units, to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit, against impact fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset or credit calculation, as described in subsection (1) above, is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full impact fee exclusive of any associated offset or credits for the excess service units. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit or offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city.

Sec. 44-66. - Establishment of accounts and records. 
(a)  The city's finance department shall establish an account for each service area for each category of capital facility for which an impact fee is imposed. Each impact fee collected within the service area shall be deposited in such account. 
(b)  Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used solely for the purposes authorized in section 44-67. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this article. 
(c)  The city's finance department shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in section 44-67. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this article. Any impact fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. Execution of a design or construction contract by the city shall be considered to be expenditure of funds of the account. 
(d)  The city's finance department shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees, which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended from each service area. The records of the account into which impact fees are deposited shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours.

Sec. 44-68. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or applicant for new development may appeal the following decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The basis for fee calculation; 
(3)  The availability or the value of an offset or credit; 
(4)  The application of an offset or credit against an impact fee due; and 
(5)  The amount of any refund due under section 44-69 of this article. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the value of the fee or the value of the offset or credit was not calculated according to the applicable impact fee schedule or the guidelines established for determining offsets and credits. 
(c)  The appellant must file a notice of appeal with the city manager of Burleson within 30 days following the decision. The development application or tap purchase or building permit application may be processed while the appeal is pending if the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city secretary in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due. 
( Ord. No. C-590(D0314), § 1(1.18) , 3-17-2014) 
Sec. 44-69. - Refunds. 
(a)  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article which has not been expended as authorized by this article within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid, or, if the impact fee was paid by another political subdivision or governmental entity, to such political subdivision or governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Section 302.002, Finance Code, or its successor statute. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facilities expansions authorized in section 44-67 within ten years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the city shall pro-rate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the conceptual service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facilities expansions identified in the capital improvements plan upon which the fee was based, the city shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the city shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than ten percent. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(e)  Upon the request of an owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid, the city shall refund such fees if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; or 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in no event later than five years from the date of fee payment. 
(f)  The city shall refund an appropriate proportion of impact fee payments in the event that a previously purchased unused water meter is replaced with a smaller meter, based on the LUE differential of the two meter sizes and the per-LUE fee at the time of the original fee payment, less an administrative charge of $50.00. 
(g)  Petitions for refunds shall be submitted to the city council on a form provided by the city for such purpose. Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the council must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to the petitioner, the council shall notify the finance director and request that a refund payment be made to the petitioner.

    Assessment means the determination of the amount of the maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit which can be imposed on new development pursuant to this article. 
    Capital improvement means a roadway facility with a life expectancy of three or more years, to be owned and operated by or on behalf of the city. 
    City means the City of Burleson, Texas. 
    Credit means a reduction in the amount of a roadway impact fee(s), payments, or charges for approved construction or provision of the same type of capital improvement for which a fee has been assessed for a new development. This is done by either by a proven decrease in the number of service units attributable to such development or a decrease in the amount of roadway impact fees otherwise due, that results from contributions of land, improvements or funds to construct system improvements in accordance with the city's subdivision and development regulations, policies or requirements, as determined by the city. 
    Final plat approval means authorization by city council that the final map of a proposed subdivision meets all city standards and conditions in accordance with the city's subdivision regulations and the mayor executes the applicant's plat and that the plat may be recorded in the office of the county clerk of Johnson or Tarrant County. The term applies both to original plats and replats. 
    Impact fee or "roadway impact fee" means a fee, charge, or assessment for roadway facilities imposed on new development by the city pursuant to this article in order to generate revenue to fund or recoup all or part of the costs of capital improvements or facility expansion necessitated by and attributable to such new development. The term includes amortized charges, lump-sum charges, capital recovery fees, contributions in aid of construction and any other fee that functions as described by this article or the statute. The term is inclusive of both the maximum assessable roadway impact fee and the roadway impact fee collection rate as herein described. 
    Land use assumptions means the description of service areas and the projections of population and employment growth and associated changes in land uses, densities and intensities adopted by the city, as may be amended from time to time, upon which the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan is based. 
    Land use equivalency table means a table converting the demands for capital improvements generated by various land uses to numbers of service units, as may be amended from time to time. The land use equivalency table may be incorporated in a schedule of impact fee rates, attached as exhibit C hereto and incorporated herein. 
    Maximum assessable roadway impact fee means the impact fee that is established for each service area computed by calculating the total projected costs of capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to new development associated with the roadway CIP, and then dividing that amount by the total number of service units anticipated within the service area based upon the land use assumptions. The maximum assessable roadway impact fee shall be established and reflected in exhibit B, schedule 1, attached hereto and incorporated herein. The city may adopt a roadway impact fee collection rate that is less than this amount, but in no instance shall the collected roadway impact fee exceed the maximum assessed roadway impact fee. 
    New development means a project involving the construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any structure, or any use or extension of land, which has the effect of increasing the requirements for capital improvements or facility expansions, measured by the number of service units to be generated by such activity. 
    Recoupment means the imposition of an impact fee to reimburse the city for capital improvements which the city has previously oversized to serve new development. 
    Roadway impact fee collection rate means the current amount of roadway impact fee adopted by Burleson City Council to be paid by the property owner, as may from time to time be amended. The adopted roadway impact fee collection rate shall be established and reflected in exhibit B, schedule 2, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 
    Roadway means any primary and secondary arterial or major collector designated in the city's adopted mobility plan, as may be amended from time to time. Roadway also includes any thoroughfare designated as a numbered highway on the official federal or state highway system; to the extent that the city incurs capital improvement costs for such facility. 
    Roadway facility means an improvement or appurtenance to a roadway which includes, but is not limited to, rights-of-way, whether conveyed by plat, deed or easement; intersection improvements; traffic signals; turn lanes; drainage facilities associated with the roadway facility; street lighting or curbs, and water and wastewater improvements affected by the roadway facility. roadway facility also includes any improvement or appurtenance to an intersection with a roadway officially enumerated in the federal or state highway system, and to any improvements or appurtenances to such federal or state highway, to the extent that the city has incurred capital costs for such facilities, including without limitation local matching funds and costs related to utility line relocation and the establishment of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage appurtenances and rights-of-way. Roadway facility excludes those improvements or appurtenances to any roadway which is a site-related facility. 
    Roadway facility expansion means the expansion of the capacity of an existing roadway in the city, but does not include the repair, maintenance, modernization, or expansion of an existing roadway to better serve existing development. 
    Roadway impact fee capital improvements plan or "capital improvements plan" (CIP) means the adopted plan included in exhibit A, as may be amended from time to time, which identifies the roadway facilities or roadway facility expansions and their costs for each roadway service area, which are necessitated by and which are attributable to new development, for a period not to exceed ten years, which are to be financed in whole or in part through the imposition of roadway impact fees pursuant to this article. 
    Service area means a roadway service area within the city's corporate boundary, within which impact fees for roadway capital improvements or roadway facility expansions may be collected for new development occurring within such area and within which fees so collected will be expended for those types of improvements or expansions identified in the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan applicable to the service area. 
    Service unit means a vehicle mile. A vehicle-mile shall be defined as one vehicle traveling a distance of one mile during the afternoon peak hour as calculated herein. 
    Site-related facility means an improvement or facility which is for the primary use or benefit of one or more new developments and/or which is for the primary purpose of safe and adequate provision of roadway facilities to serve the new development, including access to the development, which is not included in the roadway capital improvements plan, and for which the developer(s) or property owner(s) is solely responsible under subdivision or other applicable development regulations. Site-related facility may include a roadway improvement which is located offsite, within or on the perimeter of the development site. 
    System facility means a roadway improvement or facility expansion which is designated in the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan and which is not a site-related facility. System facility may include a roadway improvement which is located offsite, within or on the perimeter of the development site.

Sec. 44-158. - Roadway service areas. 
    The city hereby establishes four roadway service areas, constituting land within the city's corporate boundaries, as depicted in exhibit A, referenced hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The boundaries of the roadway service areas may be amended from time to time, or new roadway service areas may be delineated, pursuant to the procedures of this article. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 8, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-159. - Roadway impact fees adopted. 
    The city hereby adopts the maximum assessable roadway impact fee attached and incorporated as exhibit B, schedule 1, and the roadway impact fee collection rate attached and incorporated as exhibit B, schedule 2. Each non-exempt new development shall be assessed the maximum assessable roadway impact fee and shall pay the roadway impact fee collection rate, minus any applicable credits, as described herein. Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of a roadway impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 9, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-160. - Roadway impact fee required. 
    No final plat for new development shall be released for filing with Tarrant or Johnson County without assessment of an impact fee pursuant to this article; or, if no plat is required, then no building permit shall be issued until such assessment is made and the roadway impact fee collection rate is paid in accordance with the assessment and collection procedures indicated herein. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 10, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-161. - Assessment of impact fees. 
    Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a new development which has received final plat approval before the effective date of this article, assessment of impact fees shall occur on the effective date of this article, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit as set forth in exhibit B, schedule 1. However, the roadway impact fee collection rate shall not be collected on any service unit which has received final plat approval before the effective date of this article and for which a valid building permit is issued within one year after the date of adoption of this article. 
(2)  For land which is not required to be platted at the time of application for a building permit pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to development, assessment of roadway impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit as set forth in exhibit B, schedule 1 then in effect. 
(3)  For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations or which is proposed for replatting on or after the effective date of this article, assessment of impact fees shall be at the time of final plat or replat approval, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit as set forth in exhibit B, schedule 1 then in effect. 
(4)  Following assessment of the impact fee pursuant to this section, the amount of the impact fee assessment per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final plat approval or other development application that results in approval of additional service units, in which case a new assessment shall occur at the exhibit B, schedule 1 rate then in effect for such additional service unit. 
(5)  The director of engineering or his or her designee shall compute the roadway impact fees for new development by first determining whether the new development is eligible for credits calculated in accordance with this article, which would further reduce impact fees otherwise due in whole or in part. The total amount of impact fees for the new development shall be attached to the development application as a condition of approval. 
(6)  Approval of an amending plat pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.016 and the city's subdivision regulations is not subject to reassessment for an impact fee. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 11, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-162. - Exemptions to impact fees. 
    The following are exempt from the applicability of this article: 
(1)  Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.022, as amended, a public school district is not required to pay roadway impact fees imposed under this article unless the board of trustees of the district consents to the payment of the fees by entering a contract with the city imposing the fees. 
(2)  A change in use that generates less than a 20 percent increase in the number of service units attributable to the immediately preceding use is exempt from the payment of impact fees. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 12, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-163. - Collection of impact fees. 
    Roadway impact fees shall be collected in the following manner; however, the city has the ability to require construction greater than the roadway impact fee collection rate for amounts up to the maximum assessable roadway impact fee: 
(1)  The roadway impact fee collection rate shall be paid at the time the city issues a building permit for a new development. For new development which does not require a building permit (such as a change in use), the roadway impact fee collection rate shall be paid prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  For properties requiring a plat, the roadway impact fee collection rate to be paid and collected per service unit for new development shall be the amount listed in exhibit B, schedule 2 in effect at the time of final plat approval for up to a one-year period following such final plat approval. After the one-year period has expired, the roadway impact fee collection rate shall be paid according to the current amount listed in exhibit B, schedule 2 then in effect. 
(3)  For properties that do not require the filing of a plat, the roadway impact fee collection rate shall be paid and collected per service unit for new development in the amount listed in exhibit B, schedule 2 in effect at the time that the building permit application is filed. 
(4)  If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the roadway impact fee collection rate shall be computed using exhibit B, schedule 2 in effect at the time of the new application, with credits for previous payment of impact fees being applied against the new impact fees due. 
(5)  Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using exhibit B, schedule 2 in effect at the time of the request, and such additional fee shall be collected at the times prescribed by this section. 
(6)  The city may vary the rates of collection or amount of roadway impact fees per service unit among or within service areas in order to reasonably further goals and policies affecting the adequacy of roadway facilities serving new development, or other regulatory purposes affecting the type, quality, intensity, economic development potential or development timing of land uses within such service areas. 
(7)  The maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit for roadway facilities, as may be amended from time to time, hereby is declared to be an approximate and appropriate measure of the impacts generated by a new unit of development on the city's roadway system. To the extent that the roadway impact fee collection rate charged against a new development, as may be amended from time to time, is less than the maximum assessable roadway impact fee per service unit assessed, such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement of the impacts of the new development on the city's roadway system. The maximum assessable roadway impact fee may be used in evaluating any claim by a property owner that the dedication or construction of a capital improvement within a service area imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's subdivision or development regulations is disproportionate to the impacts created by the development on the city's roadway system. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 13, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-164. - Credits against impact fees. 
    The city may credit the contribution of land, improvements or funding for construction of any system facility that is required or agreed to by the city, pursuant to rules established in this section or pursuant to administrative guidelines promulgated by the city with the following limitations: 
(1)  The credit shall be associated with the plat or other detailed plan of development for the property that is to be served by the roadway facility. 
(2)  Master planned community projects, including subdivisions containing multiple phases, and whether approved before or after the effective date of these impact fee regulations, may apply for credits against roadway impact fees for the entire project based upon contributions of land, improvements or funds toward construction of system facilities. Credits shall be determined by comparing costs of roadway capital improvements supplied by the project with the costs of roadway capital improvements to be utilized by development within the project, utilizing a methodology approved by the city. The credit determination shall be incorporated within an agreement for credits, in accordance with this article. The roadway requirements of an agreement for credits shall not be less than what is required by the Burleson Development Code. 
(3)  The city's current policies and regulations shall apply to determine a new development's obligations to construct adjacent system facilities. The obligation to construct, however, shall not exceed the maximum assessable roadway impact fee assessed against the new development under exhibit B, schedule 1. Construction required under such policies and regulations shall be a credit against the amount of impact fees otherwise due. If the costs of constructing a system facility in accordance with the current city policies and regulations are greater than the amount of the roadway impact fee collection rate due, the amount of the credit due shall be deemed to be 100 percent of the assessed impact fees and no impact fee shall be collected thereafter for the development, unless the number of service units is subsequently increased. 
(4)  All credits against roadway impact fees shall be based upon standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines, including the following standards: 
a.  No credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
b.  No credit shall be given for a roadway facility which is not identified within the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan, unless the facility is on or qualifies for inclusion on the mobility plan and the city agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the roadway impact fee and provisions for credits are incorporated in an agreement for credits pursuant to this article. 
c.  In no event will the city grant a credit when no roadway impact fees can be collected pursuant to this article or for any amount exceeding the roadway impact fee collection rate due for the development, unless expressly agreed to by the city in writing. 
d.  The city may participate in the costs of a system facility to be dedicated to the city, including costs that exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fees for the development, in accordance with policies and rules established by the city. The amount of any credit for construction of a system facility shall be reduced by the amount of any participation funds received from the city. 
e.  Where funds for roadway facilities have been escrowed under an agreement that was executed with the city prior to the effective date of this article, the following rules apply: 
1.  Funds expended under the agreement for roadway facilities shall first be credited against the amount of roadway impact fees that would have been due under exhibit B, schedule 2 for those units of development for which building permits already have been issued; 
2.  Any remaining funds shall be credited against impact fees due for the development under exhibit B, schedule 2 at the time building permits are issued. 
(5)  Credits for construction of capital improvements shall be deemed created when the capital improvements are completed and the city has accepted the facility, or in the case of capital improvements constructed and accepted prior to the effective date of this article, on such effective date. Credits created after the effective date of this article shall expire ten years from the date the credit was created. Credits arising prior to such effective date shall expire ten years from such effective date. Upon application by the property owner, the city may agree to extend the expiration date for the credit on mutually agreeable terms. 
(6)  Unless an agreement for credits, as described herein, is executed providing for a different manner of applying credits against roadway impact fees due, a credit associated with a plat shall be applied at the time of application for the first building permit and, at each building permit application thereafter, to reduce impact fees due until the credit is exhausted. 
(7)  An owner of a new development who has constructed or financed a roadway capital improvement or roadway facility expansion designated in the roadway impact fee capital improvements plans, or other roadway capital improvement that supplies excess capacity, as required or authorized by the city, shall enter into an agreement with the city to provide for credits against roadway impact fees due for the development in accordance with this paragraph. The agreement shall identify the basis for and the method for computing and the amount of the credit due and any reduction in credits attributable to consumption of road capacity by developed lots or tracts served by the roadway capital improvements. For multi-phased projects, the city may require that total credits be proportionally allocated among the phases. If authorized by the city, the agreement also may provide for allocation of credits among new developments within the project, and provisions for the timing and collection of impact fees. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 14, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-165. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts. 
    The roadway impact fees collected for each service area pursuant to these regulations may be used to finance or to recoup the costs of any roadway improvements or facility expansions identified in the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan for the service area, including but not limited to the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, and land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees). Roadway impact fees may also be used to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such roadway improvements or facility expansions. Roadway impact fees may also be used to pay fees actually contracted to be paid to an independent qualified engineer or financial consultant for preparation of or updating the roadway impact fee capital improvements plan. The capital improvements advisory committee shall recommend a roadway impact fee funding plan identifying the projects to be funded with roadway impact fees. City council shall have final approval of the funding plan. Impact fees collected may not be used to pay for the expenses prohibited by statute. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 15, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-166. - Establishment of accounts. 
    The city's finance department shall establish an account to which interest is allocated for each service area for which a roadway impact fee is imposed pursuant to this article. Each impact fee collected within the service area shall be deposited in such account with the following regulations: 
(1)  Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used solely for the purposes authorized in this article and the statute. 
(2)  The city's finance department shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that roadway impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in this article and the statute. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this article; provided, however, that any roadway impact fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. 
(3)  The city's finance department shall maintain and keep financial records for roadway impact fees, which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended from each service area. The records of the account into which impact fees are deposited shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. The city may establish a fee for copying services. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 16, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-167. - Impact fee as additional and supplemental regulation. 
    Roadway impact fees established by these regulations are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land or the issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. Such impact fees are intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of the Imagine Burleson Comprehensive Plan, the capital improvements plan, the zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. This article shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other regulations and policies of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 17, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-168. - Updates to plans and revision of fees. 
    The city shall update its land use assumptions and capital improvements plan and make any revision of fees as indicated below: 
(1)  The city shall update its land use assumptions and roadway impact fee capital improvements plans and shall recalculate the roadway impact fees based thereon in accordance with the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 395, or in any successor statute. The city shall also update these items for all annexations ten acres or greater, to be completed in conjunction with the annexation process and prior to final acceptance of the annexed property(s) into the corporate city limits. For annexations of less than ten acres, the city shall complete the updates within one year of the annexation. however, this does not preclude the city from reviewing its land use assumptions, roadway impact fee capital improvements plans, roadway impact fees, and other factors such as market conditions more frequently than provided for herein to determine whether the land use assumptions and roadway capital improvements plans should be updated and the roadway impact fees recalculated accordingly, utilizing statutory update procedures. 
(2)  Exhibit B, schedule 2 may be amended without revising the land use assumptions and roadway capital improvements plans at any time prior to the update provided for in this section, provided that the roadway impact fee collection rate to be collected under exhibit B, schedule 2 do not exceed the maximum assessable roadway impact fees assessed under exhibit B, schedule 1. 
(3)  If, at the time an update is required as indicated herein and the city council determines that no change to the land use assumptions, roadway impact fee capital improvements plan or roadway impact fees are needed, it may dispense with such update by following the procedures in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.0575, or its successor statute. 
(4)  The city may amend any other provisions of this article in accordance with procedures for ordinance amendments contained in the city's Charter or state law. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 18, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-169. - Refunds. 
(a)  Upon application, any roadway impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article, which has not been expended within the service area within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in V.T.C.A., Finance Code § 302.002, or its successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be submitted within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the impact fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first out basis. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall also be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or roadway facility expansions authorized within the service area within ten years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected within the service area for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), the city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the impact fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
( Ord. No. CSO#600-03-2017 , § 19, 3-6-2017) 
Sec. 44-170. - Rebates. 
    If the building permit for a new development for which a roadway impact fee has been paid has expired, and a modified or new application has not been filed within six months of such expiration, the city shall, upon written application, rebate the amount of the impact fee to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid. If no application for rebate pursuant to this subsection has been filed within this period, no rebate shall become due.

Sec. 54-78. - Purpose and interpretation of article provisions. 
    This article is intended to reduce the exposure of children to adult material which the community deems inappropriate for exposure to children without parental supervision. Nothing herein is intended to prevent the adult community from having access to constitutionally protected material, nor to create an unreasonable impediment to the adult public access. It is the intent of this article to balance the rights of the adult community with the need to protect children from material that the community deems inappropriate for children without parental supervision. A court, when called upon to interpret this article, shall first look to the constitutional rights of the adult community and then to the reasonableness of the restriction of access to the child. The court is further informed that this article is solely for the purpose of restricting access to adult material to children, so that the parent or legal guardian may fulfill the duties of providing educational direction for morals, family beliefs, ethics and standards. The court is further informed that the purpose of this article is to establish a standard for material that is commercially available to a child which is more restrictive than that which would normally be deemed constitutionally protected, but which a reasonably prudent parent would deem inappropriate for their child, children, or ward to consume or examine without prior parental knowledge. The court, when called upon to determine if any given material is in fact adult material, shall apply a local community standard of what a reasonably prudent parent would deem inappropriate for general unsupervised availability and the court is not limited to examination of the work was a whole, but may look to any portion less than the whole to determine if the material is in fact adult material. The court may also consider the manner of presentation or self declared purpose or audience of the material or the manner in which the material or publisher thereof, chooses to market the material to a given adult audience, if that advertisement or self declared purpose would lead a reasonably prudent parent to believe that the material was intended for an adult audience. The court is further advised that it is not the intent to criminalize the viewing of material which a national or local community standard or rating system has authorized for the commercial viewing by persons of a younger age.

(4)  If a member of the municipal authority responsible for approving plats has a substantial interest in a subdivided tract, the member shall file, before a vote or decision regarding the approval of a plat for the tract, an affidavit stating the nature and extent of the interest and shall abstain from further participation in the matter. The affidavit must be filed with the municipal secretary or clerk.

(8)  Any other information as required by the decision-making bodies. 
(b)  Design guidelines. 
(1)  The sign design guidelines are designed to help ensure quality signs that communicate their message in a clear fashion; however, the "guidelines" are not as strict as sign "standards." The city council may interpret the design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific signs/projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each sign or project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
a.  Compatibility with surroundings. 
1.  Proportional size and scale. The scale of signs should be based on the building facade on which they are placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportional with the scale of the structure. Large storefronts such as big boxes will be allowed to have proportionally larger signs than smaller storefronts. Signs should not overwhelm the section of the building facade on which it is placed upon. 
2.  Integrate signs with the building. Signs should be designed so that they are integrated with the design of the building. A well designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design, and a coordinated color scheme. Signs in multiple-tenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building. Sign placement and design should be reviewed within the context of building design. 
3.  Corporate franchise signage. Corporate franchise signage should conform to the community's visual desires while maintaining some elements of corporate identity. Corporate logos should fit the context, color, scale and building elements. 
b.  Location and mounting. 
1.  Signs should be mounted in locations that respect the design of a building and site, including the arrangement of bays and openings. Signs should not obscure windows, (including second-story windows), window trim/molding, grillwork, piers, pilasters, and other ornamental features. 
2.  Attached signs on fascias above storefront windows should be sized to fit within existing friezes, lintels, spandrels, and other such features and not extend above, below, or beyond them. Typically, attached signs should be centered on horizontal surfaces (e.g., over a storefront opening). 
3.  When a large building contains several storefronts, signs for the individual businesses should relate well to each other in terms of locations, height, proportion, color, and illumination. Maintaining continuity will reinforce the building's facade composition while still retaining each business's identity. 
c.  Color. 
1.  Avoid using too many colors. Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided. 
2.  Use contrasting colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. Light letters on a dark background work best for both day and night time use. 
d.  Materials. 
1.  Compatibility of materials. Sign materials should be compatible with the design of the facade on which they are placed. Consider the architectural design of the building's facade and select materials that complement the design. The selected materials should also contribute to the legibility of the sign. For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections. 
2.  Appropriate materials. Sign materials should be extremely durable. Paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use (except on awnings) because they deteriorate quickly. If wood is used, it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the sign's lettering to deteriorate. 
e.  Sign legibility. 
1.  Concise name identification. A concise name or limited lines of copy should be used whenever possible given the limited amount of time the vehicle traveling public has to identify and read the sign. The fewer number of words, the more effective the sign. A simple and succinct sign is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered. 
2.  Use symbols and logos. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words whenever appropriate. Pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewer's mind than a written message. And they can be an expression of the owner's creativity. 
3.  Limit the number of letter styles. The number of lettering styles that are used on a sign should be limited in order to increase legibility. As a general rule, limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
f.  Sign illumination. 
1.  Internal illumination. Individually illuminated letters, either internally illuminated or backlit solid letters (reverse channel) are a preferred alternative to internally illuminated plastic cabinet signs. Signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure. 
2.  Use a projected light source. Signs along roadways with slower moving traffic or in pedestrian-oriented environment should consider illumination by a projected light source (e.g., spotlight). Projection lighting is usually a better alternative because the sign will appear to be integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the building's face as well. Projected lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface and signs become an integral part of the facade. The use of small, unobtrusive fixtures for external (projection) lighting is encouraged. Avoid the use of oversized fixtures that are out of scale with the sign and structure. Whenever projection lighting is used (fluorescent or incandescent), care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-of-way. Signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability. 
3.  Cabinet signs. The use of internally illuminated cabinet signs is discouraged. When such signs are proposed, the background field is required to be opaque so that only the lettering appears illuminated (e.g., routed or push-through lettering/graphics). When the background is not opaque, the entire sign face becomes bright and the sign becomes visually separated from the building. As a result, this type of sign can disrupt the continuity of the facade. 
4.  Electrical raceways and conduits. Electrical transformer boxes and raceways are required to be concealed from public view. If a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall, the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall, or integrated into the overall design of the sign. If raceways are necessary, they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never extend in width or height beyond the area of the sign's lettering or graphics. All exposed conduit and junction boxes should also be concealed from public view. 
5.  Neon signs. Neon/L.E.D. or similar types of lighting are discouraged.

Sec. 63-100. - Measurement standards. 
(a)  Sign area measurement. 
(1)  For a wall sign, which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and dimensions, shall include the entire portion within such background or frame. 
(2)  For a wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area and dimensions of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different elements. (See figure 63-J below for walls signs, and figure 63-K for freestanding signs.) 

Figure 63-J: Example of geometric area applied to sign area calculations 

Figure 63-K: Example of calculation for freestanding sign area 
(3)  For a vehicle sign the area and height of the sign does not include the vehicle, itself. 
(4)  For a freestanding sign, the sign area shall include the frame, if any, but shall not include: 
a.  A pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to constitute a display device, or a part of a display device. 
b.  Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms complementing the site in general. 
(5)  When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of one of the two faces. When the sign has more than two display surfaces, the area of the sign shall be the area of largest display surfaces that are visible from any single direction. The area of a sign with more than two faces would be calculated as the area of the largest rectangular plane of the panels that are visible from any single location. (See figure 63-L below.) 

Figure 63-L: Example of a sign area with multiple faces 
(6)  In the event of a dispute in determining the area or dimensions of any sign, the decision of the building official may be appealed by the applicant through the submittal of a formal application to the director of community development department in accordance with the variance process described in this chapter. 
(7)  Determining sign height.

Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. 
(4)  All Group II and III dischargers shall submit an industrial user survey. The survey will be reviewed by personnel authorized by the director. If deemed necessary, Group II, III or IV dischargers may also be required to obtain a permit as outlined herein. The discharger shall then submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
(5)  The authority will evaluate the completed applications and data furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. If, after evaluation, the application is deemed satisfactory, then a wastewater discharge permit shall be issued within 60 days after the evaluation is complete. The wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified herein and to the regulations of the authority. 
(6)  If the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing within 30 days of the reasons for such denial. If denial is based on the authority's determination that the applicant cannot meet the wastewater discharge limitations of this article, the authority may specify that the applicant be required to provide pretreatment of the waste before it is deemed acceptable for sewer discharge. 
(7)  Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this article and wastewater permit, pursuant to subsection (a)(5) above, the discharger shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implement added operational and maintenance activities. 
a.  The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this article including, but not limited to dates, relating to hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract(s) for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this article. 
b.  The time increments established between milestone dates shall be the shortest practicable for the completion of the required work. Under no circumstances shall the authority permit a time increment for a single step in the compliance schedule to exceed nine months. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for applicable categorical pretreatment standards. 
c.  Not later than 14 days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a progress report to the authority, including a statement as to whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the authority. 
(8)  Prior to the approval of a permit, unless exempted by the authority, all dischargers shall provide monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and/or flow measurement of wastewaters before entering the sanitary sewer of the authority. Each monitoring facility shall be located on the discharger's premises; provided, however, where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the discharger, the authority may approve the placement of monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. All monitoring equipment and facilities shall be maintained in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. Failure to provide proper monitoring facilities shall be grounds for denial of a permit. 
(b)  Permit conditions. Permits are issued to a specific discharger for specific operation and are not assignable to another discharger or transferable to any other location without the prior written approval of the authority. 
(1)  Wastewater discharge permit transfer may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 90 days advance notice to the authority and the authority approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the authority must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
a.  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and process; 
b.  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
c.  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. 
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(2)  Wastewater discharge permit requirements: 
a.  A statement that indicates wastewater discharge permit duration, which in no event shall exceed five years; 
b.  A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is nontransferable without prior notification to the city in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with a copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit; 
c.  Effluent limits and best management practices (BMPs) based on applicable pretreatment standards as set forth in 40 CFR part 403, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law; 
d.  Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and record-keeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or best management practices) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on federal, state, and local law; and 
e.  Permits shall contain a statement of the civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by federal, state, and local law. 
f.  Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the city to be necessary. 
(3)  Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions: 
a.  Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization; 
b.  Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology, pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment works; 
c.  Requirements for the development and implementation of spill control plans or other special conditions including management practices necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated, or non-routine discharges; 
d.  Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW, the unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the management of the wastewater discharge to the POTW; 
e.  The unit charge of schedule of user charges and fees for management of the wastewater discharge to the POTW; 
f.  Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities and equipment; 
g.  A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all applicable federal and state pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and 
h.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the authority to ensure compliance with this article, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. 
(c)  Reporting requirements for dischargers. 
(1)  Baseline report. Within 180 days following the effective date for new or revised categorical pretreatment standards, or at least 90 days prior to commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the authority a report (in a form provided by the authority), indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The report shall also contain: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The result of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in this section. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section subsection (c)(4) of this section. 
4.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. However, the city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. Historical data than can represent the current discharge only can be accepted as a baseline report. 
5.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O & M ) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment, best management practices and/or O & M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O & M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this article must meet the requirements set out in this section. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports shall be signed by an authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional as stated in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(6). 
(2)  90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons, in addition to best management practices. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  Periodic compliance reports for categorical SIUs. Any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard made a part of this article shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards hereof, along with best management practices. Reports are required after the compliance date of such a pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge, and are to be submitted at least once every six months (on dates specified by the authority). In addition, where applicable, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in section 82-45 hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, taking into consideration extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
a.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
b.  All non-significant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements and data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
c.  If the director has determined that a non-significant industrial user (NSIU) needs a permit, then the NSIU shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
d.  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (c)(9) of this section. 
All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring equipment in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(4)  Analyses and sampling procedures. 
a.  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator of the EPA. Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by EPA. 
b.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in subsection (c)(4)b.2. and 3., below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
3.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsection (c)(1) and (2) of this section, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities which historical sampling data is available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. 
4.  For the reports required by this section the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(5)  Reporting additional monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (c)(4) and (b)(2) of this section, the results of this monitoring along with chain-of-custody forms shall be included in the report. 
(6)  Periodic compliance reports for significant noncategorical industrial user. Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the authority at least once every six months (on dates as specified by the authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the authority. These reports shall be based on all sampling and analysis at the permitted sampling location for all regulated pollutants performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in subsection (c)(4) of this section. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. 
(7)  Notification of changed discharge. Dischargers shall give prior written notification to the authority and City of Fort Worth of any potential and actual significant changes in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the IU has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p), and any changes at its facility that affect the potential for slug discharge. 
a.  The notification to the authority shall be received at least 90 days prior to change. 
b.  The authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
c.  The authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
d.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, and the deletion of any pollutant regulated by this article or a permit issued pursuant to this article. 
e.  Significant industrial users that discharge wastewater to treatment plant operated by the city shall provide prior written notification to the city of changes to its wastewater discharges and any changes at its facility that affect the potential for a slug discharge. 
(8)  Authority monitoring. Sampling and analysis for the reports required by subsections (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) above may be performed by the authority in lieu of the discharger. If all information required for the report, including flow data, is collected by the authority , the discharger will be required to submit the report or certifications. 
(9)  Signatory requirements. 
a.  All applications and compliance reports submitted to the authority must contain the following certification statement and be signed by the authorized representative: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information and for not reporting known violations, including possibility of fine and imprisonment." 
b.  A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user (NSCIU) by the director must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in 40 CFR 403.120(I). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the director: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR _____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from ________, ________ to ________, ________ [months, days, year]: 
1. The facility described as ___________ [facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described in subsection (a)(1)e. of this section; and 
2. The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
3. The facility never discharged categorical process wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. 
This compliance certification is based on the following information: 
_____
(10)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the authority , a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The authority is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(d)  Inspection and flow measurement. 
(1)  Inspection. 
a.  The authority shall inspect the facilities of any discharger at least once a year to determine compliance with the requirements for SIUs, NSCIUs and NSIUs of this article. The director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs a plan to control slug discharges at the time of SIU determination, or at least by the first year. The discharger shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. All reports and records related to the provisions of this article shall be made available for copying and inspection by the authority . The authority shall have the right to set upon the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and metering or measuring operations. The inspectors, agents or representatives of the authority charged with the enforcement of this article shall be deemed to be performing a governmental function for the benefit and health and welfare of the general public and neither the authority nor any individual inspector, agent or representative shall be held liable for any loss or damage, whether real or asserted, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of the performance of such governmental function. The failure or refusal of such owner or discharger to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the disconnection of water or sewer service to the facility. If entry is denied or if a person in control cannot be located, the director shall have every recourse provided by law to secure entry. Such recourse shall include the right to obtain a search warrant under the guidelines of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; and for the purposes of same, any person with enforcement authority under this chapter is hereby declared to be a "health officer." 
b.  User shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the city to perform independent monitoring activities. 
c.  Facilities regulated under this chapter are subject to the authority of the following agencies concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing federal and state pretreatment programs and other applicable law: (i) the EPA under section 308 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 3318), as amended; and (ii) the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) under V.T.C.A., Water Code, §§ 26.014 and 26.015, as amended, and V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code, §§ 361.032 and 361.037, as amended, provisions of the Texas Water Code and Texas Health Safety Code. 
d.  The industrial waste discharged or deposited into the sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the authority . Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration the waste under operational conditions. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. The determination of the character and concentration of industrial waste shall be made at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the authority . Should a discharger desire a determination of the quality of such industrial waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the authority , such special determination may be made by the authority at the expense of the owner or discharger. 
e.  The authority shall conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The authority shall inspect, evaluate the need for a plan to control slug discharges, and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. The result of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(2)  NOV/Repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. Within 30 days submit to the director a report which addresses: The time, date, location, processes, and operations associated with the violation, and the personnel assigned responsibility and/or present during the violation; the cause or probable cause of the noncompliance; and the actions taken and implemented to meet permit conditions. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
a.  The authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
b.  The authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(3)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing sewage charges shall be based upon metered water consumption or discharge as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city's water department. 
Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the metered water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the director may require or permit the installation of additional approved meters at the owner's expense, to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system. If approved by the director, the measured quantity of water actually entering the sewer system will be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
Any discharger who procures all or part of its water supply from sources other than the city water department, all or part of which is subsequently discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at its expense an effluent meter or flow measuring device approved by the director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, the quantity or quality of the waste shall be determined in any manner or method the director may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sanitary sewage system of the authority and/or the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
(e)  Permit modifications. 
(1)  The authority reserves the right to amend any permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the authority with applicable laws and regulations. The authority may amend any permit for good cause including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
b.  Material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit. 
c.  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge. 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the authority 's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the receiving waters. 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit. 
f.  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting. 
g.  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit. 
h.  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator. 
i.  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws, or rules and regulations. 
j.  To incorporate, revise, or revoke new or existing best management practices. 
(2)  All categorical pretreatment standards promulgated and adopted by the EPA after the effective date of this article shall automatically become a part of this article. Where a discharger, subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required by subsection a)(2) above, the discharger shall apply for a permit from the authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard by the EPA. In addition, the discharger with an existing permit shall submit to the authority within 180 days after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the information required by subsection (c)(1) above. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(f)  Confidential information. 
(1)  All information and data submitted by a discharger to the authority or POTW may be submitted to any state or federal agency governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure, provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2 as follows: 
a.  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedures set forth below. 
b.  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(2)  Asserting business confidentiality claim. A discharger which is submitting information to the authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on or attaching to the information, at the time it is submitted to the authority , a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the authority . If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(3)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, and the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by the discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. Effluent data which cannot be held as confidential is as defined in 40 CFR 2.302. 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to any public disclosure requirements which may exist under the Texas Public Information Act, of V.T.C.A., Government Code, ch. 552, as amended. 
(g)  Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit re-issuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. If the user submits an application in compliance with subsection (a), and the failure of the Director to reissue a permit prior to the expiration of the previous permit is not due to any act or omission of the user, the expired permit shall continue to be effective and enforceable until reissued. 
(Ord. No. B-755-06(A1211), § 1, 1-3-2011) 
Sec. 82-46. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notice of violation.

(3)  Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond in person or in writing to the authority , advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. 
(4)  The user shall not recommence its discharge until the director so authorizes and: 
a.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the noncomplying discharge has ceased; 
b.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the conditions creating the threat of imminent and substantial danger have been eliminated; 
c.  The user pays the city for all costs the city will incur in reinstating services. 
d.  Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(2)  Show cause order. An order which directs the user to appear before the City to explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied. Typically used after informal contacts or NOV's have failed to resolve noncompliance; however, it can be used at anytime. 
(3)  Compliance order. An order which directs the industrial user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. Terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance. Typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair, or process changes, or to require development of management practices, spill prevention programs, and other pretreatment program requirements. 
(d)  Right of appeal of administrative ruling. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by this article and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this article or deals with a permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply; provided, however, the authority may take any action it deems necessary to protect its wastewater collection and treatment system or to comply with its TPDES permit or to comply with any contract the authority has for the treatment of wastewater. 
(e)  Judicial proceedings. The authority, with respect to the conduct of any discharger contrary to the provisions of this article may authorize its attorney to commence any legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority may petition, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, ch. 54, a district court or other court of proper jurisdiction through its attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunction relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. The authority may also seek to recover civil penalties of up to $5,000.00 per day pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, § 54.018.

Any discharger notified of the suspension of the authority 's water or wastewater service and/or the discharger's permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the authority , cease all discharges. In the event of the failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority may commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with such order or may immediately disconnect such discharger's service line from the city water and sanitary sewer system. In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the director shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or discharger before disconnecting the service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the illegal discharge and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
(2)  The authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater or water service upon proof by the discharger of the cessation of the non-complying discharge or elimination of conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Affirmative defense to discharge violations. 
(1)  Affirmative defense to discharge violations for action in municipal or state court. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of this article or a permit issued under this article was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of this article or the permit. In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe has been established the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(2)  Affirmative defense to upset. In an action brought in federal, court, it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset, if the user demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that an upset occurred and that the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; the facility was at the time operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; informed the authority within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the event. Where such information is given orally, the authority may at its discretion require the discharger to file a written report within five working days. The report shall specify: 
a.  Description of the event, its cause and the event's impact on a discharger's compliance status. 
b.  Duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and times of non-compliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur. 
c.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an event or other conditions of non-compliance. 
(3)  Affirmative defense to specific prohibited discharge standards. It is an affirmative defense in federal court to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of Section 82-43(b) or a specific prohibition of subsections 82-43(d)(1), (2), (6), (17) and (18) that the user did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its TPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(4)  An operating event which was not the result of negligence on the part of the discharger, and which has been documented and verified in the manner stated above shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the authority against a discharger for any non-compliance with the article which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the event. 
(h)  Recovery of costs incurred by the authority. Any discharger who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the authority 's wastewater system, shall be liable to the authority for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The authority shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the authority for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Failure to pay such bill may result in the termination of water or wastewater service. 
(i)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in subsection (e)(3) of this section. 
(j)  POTW pretreatment requirements. All POTW's shall be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements. All POTWs shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000.00 a day for each violation by industrial users of pretreatment standards and requirements. POTWs whose approved pretreatment programs require modification to conform to the requirements of this subsection shall submit a request for approval of a program modification in accordance with [40 CFR Part] 403.18, unless the state would be required to enact or amend a statutory provision, in which case the POTW shall submit such a request.

(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-205), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-167. - Goal for erosion and sediment control at construction sites. 
    The goal for erosion and sediment control at sites over one acre disturbed by construction is achievement of at least the minimum site rating of 0.70 using the site rating system as presented in section 3 of the "Stormwater Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities - North Central Texas, Second Edition," North Central Texas Council of Governments, Arlington, Texas, June, 1999. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-206), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-168. - General requirements for stormwater discharges from construction activities. 
(a)  Best management practices enumerated. All operators of construction sites shall use best management practices to control and reduce the discharge to the MS4 and to waters of the United States of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other material associated with clearing, grading, excavation, landfilling, and other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. Any best management practices capable of installation and/or implementation prior to commencement of construction (for example, structural measures) shall be installed and/or implemented prior to commencement of construction at the site or in compliance with a schedule for installation and/or implementation in an applicable SWPPP. The best management practices used at construction sites may include, but not be limited to, the following measures: 
(1)  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. 
(2)  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the site to the extent feasible; 
(3)  Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site; 
(4)  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, asphalt and mortar, to the MS4 or waters of the United States; 
(5)  Measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper cleanup and disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
(6)  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering waste materials, minimizing ground contact with hazardous chemicals and trash, and installing and maintaining covered receptacles for rubbish and garbage to assure that such waste materials are not blown or carried by rainfall runoff from the site; 
(7)  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures, and other best management practices to maintain them in good and effective operating condition; and 
(8)  Installation of structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed. Structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree attainable. Such installed structural measures may include, but not be limited to, the following: stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); stormwater retention structures; flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; other velocity dissipation devices; infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems which combine several practices. operators of construction sites are only responsible for the installation and maintenance of stormwater management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and are not responsible for maintenance after stormwater discharges associated with construction activity have terminated. 
(b)  Inspection. Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is 0.5 inches or greater. All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4. Based on the results of the inspection, best management practices shall be modified as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable. 
(c)  Responsibility for compliance with section provisions. Any owner of a site of construction activity, whether or not he is an operator, is jointly and individually responsible for compliance with the requirements in this section. Any contractor or subcontractor on a site of construction activity, who is not an owner or operator, but who is responsible under his contract or subcontract, for implementing a best management practices control measure, is jointly and individually responsible for any willful or negligent failure on his part to adequately implement that control measure. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-207), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-169. - Management plan submittal and review for stormwater discharges from construction activity.

(2)  The director has been afforded adequate time and opportunity to review the management plans and specifications; and 
(3)  The management practices described in the plans and observed upon any site inspection conducted are adequate to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(c)  Issuance of orders. If, upon the director's review of the management plans and specifications required by subsection (a) of this section (or any modified plans required by subsection (e) of this section) and any site inspection that the director may conduct, the director determines that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon the site inspection are not adequate to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable, the director may issue an order prohibiting the commencement, or the continuation, of any construction activity at the site. Any order issued by the director under the authority of this subsection may be in the form of a compliance order under section 82-178, an emergency cease and desist order under section 82-180, or a stop work order under section 82-181. 
(d)  Denial of approval; grounds. The city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon a site inspection by the director are determined not to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(e)  Modifications; submission. Whenever the management practices at a construction site are modified (as a result of change in the construction project, in order to implement more effective management practices, in response to an order or request from the city, or for any other reason), a written description of such modifications of the management practices shall be submitted to the director as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the change in the management practices. 
(f)  Non-applicability of section provisions. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any of the following activities: 
(1)  Any construction activity that results in the disturbance of five or more acres of total land area, or that is part of a common plan of development or sale within which five or more acres of total land area are disturbed, and any other construction activity for which an NPDES permit is required for stormwater discharges associated with that construction activity. (In such circumstances, the requirements of section 82-170 apply in lieu of this section.) 
(2)  Any public works construction project that is administered, performed, contracted, or funded (in whole or in part) by the city. 
(3)  Any construction activity, not a part of a larger plan of development of five acres or more, related to the construction, alteration, or addition to a single-family, duplex or four-plex residential structure, or an accessory use to any such structure, where one primary structure is constructed per legal block and the construction activity does not result in the disturbance of more than 12,000 square feet of total land area. 
(4)  Any construction incident to repair or maintenance of a utility line (such as for telecommunications, electricity, water, sewer, and natural gas). (Construction incident to the laying of new utility lines or replacement of existing lines is not exempted from this section by this subsection.) 
(5)  Interior alteration of an existing building when the alteration does not increase the square footage, area, or height of the building. 
(6)  Construction of a fence, but no exemption is granted by this subsection for construction of a retaining wall or a fence that may significantly obstruct or change the direction of flow of water. 
(7)  Any construction activity that the director expressly finds not to cause, or threaten to cause, any discharge of any harmful quantity of any material associated with construction activity into the MS4 or any other water in the state. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-208), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-170. - Five-acre disturbances from construction activity. 
    All operators of sites of construction activity, including clearing, grading, excavation, and landfilling activities, that result in the disturbance of five or more acres of total land area, or that are part of a common plan of development or sale within which five or more acres of total land area are disturbed, or who are required to obtain an NPDES permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity, shall comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in section 82-168): 
(1)  Any operator who intends to obtain coverage for stormwater discharges from a construction site under the NPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from construction sites (the construction general permit) shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the city engineer, and to any other responsible city departmental director, at least 15 calendar days prior to the commencement of construction activities. If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this article, the NOI shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the effective date of this article. For stormwater discharges from construction sites where the operator changes, an NOI shall be submitted at least two calendar days prior to when the new operator commences work at the site. 
(2)  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) shall be prepared and implemented prior to the beginning of construction activities in accordance with the requirements of the construction general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWPPP shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a licensed professional engineer. The signature and seal of the licensed professional engineer shall constitute his attestation that the SWPPP fully complies with the requirements of the construction general permit, or with any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. The SWPPP shall contain the name, title, and business address of the licensed professional engineer signing it, and the date that he did so. 
(4)  The SWPPP shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the construction general permit and this article. Any update or modification to the SWPPP shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a licensed professional engineer. 
(5)  The SWPPP shall be prepared and submitted to the director at least 15 calendar days prior to the commencement of construction activities. If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this article, the SWPPP shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the effective date of this article. 
(6)  A copy of any SWPPP that is required by subsection (2) of this section shall be submitted to the city in conjunction with any application for a building permit, grading permit, site development plan approval, and any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction at the site. 
(7)  If, upon the director's review of the SWPPP (or any modification to the SWPPP) and any site inspection that the director may conduct, the director determines that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the construction general permit, any individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article, the director may issue an order prohibiting the commencement, or the continuation, of any construction activity at the site. Also, if at any time the director determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the director may similarly issue an order prohibiting the continuation of any construction activity at the site. Any order issued by the director under the authority of this subsection may be in the form of a compliance order under section 82-178, an emergency cease and desist order under section 82-180,or a stop work order under section 82-181. 
(8)  Upon review of the SWPPP and any site inspection that is conducted, the city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the construction general permit, any individual or group NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. Also, if at any time the city determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the city may similarly deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, at the site. 
(9)  All contractors and subcontractors identified in an SWPPP shall sign a copy of the following certification statement before conducting any professional service identified in the SWPPP: 
I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that authorizes the stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification. 
The certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site; and the date the certification is made. 
(10)  The SWPPP, with the licensed professional engineer's signature, seal, and date affixed, and the certifications of contractors and subcontractors required by subsection (9) of this section, and with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the construction site from the date of commencement of construction through the date of final stabilization. 
(11)  The operator shall make a copy of the SWPPP and any modification thereto available to the director and any other authorized city inspector at the construction site upon request (as well as to EPA and state inspectors). 
(12)  The director may notify the operator at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the construction general permit, any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or ordinance which are not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP require modifications in order to meet such requirements. Within seven calendar days of such notification from the director (or as otherwise provided by the director), the operator shall make the required changes to the SWPPP and shall submit to the director a written certification that the requested modifications have been made. 
(13)  The operator shall modify the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWPPP, or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with construction activity. In addition, the SWPPP shall be modified to identify any new contractor and/or subcontractor that will implement a measure in the SWPPP. All modifications to the SWPPP shall be submitted to the director within seven calendar days of a change, determination of ineffectiveness (self or city inspection), or effective date of changes in contractor and/or subcontractor. 
(14)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of the storm that is 0.5 inches or greater. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWPPP shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
(15)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (14) of this section, the site description and/or the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWPPP shall be modified as appropriate, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the inspection. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWPPP within seven calendar days following the inspection. All modifications to the SWPPP shall be submitted to the director within seven calendar days of the date of inspection. 
(16)  A report summarizing the scope of any inspection required by subsection (14) of this section, and the names and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the dates of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, and actions taken in accordance with subsection (15) of this section, shall be made and retained as part of the SWPPP for at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized. Such report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance. Where a report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, the facility's NPDES permit, and this article. The report shall be certified and signed by the person responsible for making it. 
(17)  The operator shall retain copies of any SWPPP and all reports required by this article or by the NPDES permit for the site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI, for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized. 
(18)  Where a site has been finally stabilized and all stormwater discharges from construction activities that are authorized by this article and by the NPDES permit for those construction activities are eliminated, or where the operator of all stormwater discharges at a facility changes, the operator of the construction site shall submit to the city engineer, and to any other responsible city departmental director, a notice of termination (NOT) that includes the information required for notices of termination the construction general permit. 
(19)  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner (or the duly authorized representative thereof) shall submit to the responsible director written certification by a licensed professional engineer that the site has been finally stabilized. (See definition of "final stabilization" in this article.) The city may withhold an occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the responsible director has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has, in fact, occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

If industrial activity requiring an NPDES stormwater permit is already underway upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, a copy of the permit assignment notice or the NOI shall be submitted within 30 calendar days. Where the operator of a facility with a stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity which is covered by an NPDES general permit changes, the new operator of the facility shall submit an NOI at least two calendar days prior to the change. (Note: Reference within this section to an NPDES general permit or to the appropriate NPDES general permit shall be deemed to refer to either the baseline industrial general permit or the multi-sector general permit.) 
(2)  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the industrial facility, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article, and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWPPP shall be completed prior to the submittal of the NOI to the director and, for a new industrial operation, prior to the commencement of the industrial activity at the facility. The SWPPP shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the appropriate NPDES general permit and this article. 
(4)  A copy of any NOI that is required by subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the city in conjunction with any application for a permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the industrial facility. 
(5)  The director may require any operator who is required by subsection (a)(2) of this section to prepare a SWPPP to submit the SWPPP, and any modifications thereto, to the director for review. Such submittal and review of the SWPPP may be required by the director prior to commencement of or during industrial activity at the facility. 
(6)  Upon the director's review of the SWPPP and any site inspection that he may conduct, the city may deny approval of any application for a permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the facility, on the grounds that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the industrial facility, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article or other city ordinances. Also, if at any time the director determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the city may similarly deny approval of any application for a permit or other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the industrial facility. 
(7)  The SWPPP, with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the industrial facility from the date of commencement of operations until all stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated and the required notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted in accordance with the appropriate NPDES general permit. 
(8)  The operator shall make the SWPPP and any modification thereto available to the director upon request (as well as to EPA and state inspectors). 
(9)  The director may notify the operator at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit, any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the industrial facility, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article or other city ordinances. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or ordinance which are not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP require modifications in order to meet such requirements. Within 30 calendar days of such notification from the director (or as otherwise provided by the director), the operator shall make the required changes to the SWPPP and shall submit to the director a written certification that the requested changes have been made. 
(10)  The operator shall amend the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity. 
(11)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator) shall inspect equipment and areas of the facility specified in the SWPPP at appropriate intervals. A set of tracking or follow-up procedures shall be used to ensure that appropriate actions are taken in response to the inspections. Records of inspection shall be maintained and made available to the director upon request. 
(12)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator) shall conduct comprehensive site compliance evaluations as required by the appropriate NPDES general permit at intervals of no less than once per year. Based on the results of the compliance evaluation, the description of potential pollutant sources and the pollution prevention measures and controls that are identified in the SWPPP shall be revised as appropriate within two weeks of such evaluation and shall provide for implementation of any changes to the SWPPP in a timely manner, but in no case more than 12 weeks after the compliance evaluation. 
(13)  A report summarizing the scope of the comprehensive site compliance evaluation required by the appropriate NPDES general permit, personnel making the compliance inspection, the dates of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, and actions taken in accordance with necessary and appropriate plan revisions shall be made and retained as part of the SWPPP for at least one year after all stormwater discharges from the facility are eliminated and the required NOT has been submitted. The report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance; or, if the report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, the applicable NPDES permit, and this article. The report shall be signed by the individual responsible for the comprehensive site compliance evaluation, and it shall be submitted to the director within ten calendar days of its completion. 
(14)  If the industrial facility is required by the appropriate NPDES general permit to conduct monitoring, records of the monitoring results shall be retained at the facility and made available to the director upon request. 
(15)  By written notice, the director may require any industrial facility identified in accordance with this section to implement a monitoring program at its expense that includes the submission of quantitative data on the following constituents: 
a.  Any pollutants limited in effluent guidelines subcategories; 
b.  Any pollutant listed in an existing NPDES permit for the facility; 
c.  Oil and grease, COD, pH, 30D5, TSS, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen; and 
d.  Information on discharges required under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(iii) and (iv). 
The director may require written reports of any such monitoring to be submitted to him. 
(16)  By written notice, the director may require any industrial facility identified in this section to conduct semi-annual or annual monitoring of stormwater discharges, or the director may specify an alternative monitoring frequency and/or specify additional parameters to be analyzed. The director may require written reports of any such additional monitoring to be submitted to him. 
(17)  The operator shall retain the SWPPP until at least one year after stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated, or that operator is no longer operating the facility, and a notice of termination (NOT) in compliance with the appropriate NPDES general permit has been submitted. The operator shall retain all records of all monitoring information, copies of all required reports, and records of all data used to complete the NOI, until at least one year after all stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated, or the operator ceases to operate that facility, and the required notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted. 
(18)  For discharges subject to monitoring requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit, in addition to the records-retention requirements of the paragraph above, operators shall retain records of all monitoring information collected for the period of time required by the appropriate NPDES general permit. operators must submit such monitoring results, and/or a summary thereof, to the director upon his request. 
(19)  Upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no discharge shall contain any of the following hazardous metals in a concentration exceeding the maximum concentrations (in mg/L) of each of the hazardous metals listed as follows: 
Metal Average Daily 
Composite Grab 
Sample Arsenic 0.1 0.2 0.3 Barium 1.0 2.0 4.0 Cadmium 0.05 0.1 0.2 Chromium 0.5 1.0 5.0 Copper 0.5 1.0 2.0 Lead 0.5 1.0 1.5 Manganese 1.0 2.0 3.0 Mercury 0.005 0.005 0.01 Nickel 1.0 2.0 3.0 Selenium 0.05 0.1 0.2 Silver 0.05 0.1 0.2 Zinc 1.0 2.0 6.0  
(20)  Where all stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity that are authorized by this article, and by the NPDES permit for those discharges from industrial activities, are eliminated, or where the operator of stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity at a facility changes, the operator of the facility shall submit to the director a notice of termination (NOT) that includes the information required for notices of termination by the appropriate NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Responsibility for compliance with section provisions. Any owner of a facility with a stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity to which subsection (a) of this section applies, whether or not he is an operator of the facility, is jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the best management practices (BMP) measures required in the SWPPP for the facility. 
(c)  Difficulty in compliance; enforcement. Upon request by the director, all owners and operators of any facility that experience a problem complying with the requirements of this article, the industrial general permit, or any applicable individual or group NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the industrial facility, shall consult with the director, any other representative of the city, and any third party designated by the city in an attempt to achieve compliance as soon as practicable. If compliance is not achieved to the city's satisfaction, the city may, in its discretion, report the noncompliance to EPA and/or the state, and/or the city may itself undertake any enforcement action authorized by sections 82-175-82-181, and 82-184-82-190. Exercise of the city's option for consultation under this subsection (c) shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other enforcement action against any owner or operator of the facility. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-210), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-172. - Right of entry: inspection and sampling. 
(a)  The director, or authorized representative, shall have the right to enter the premises of any person discharging stormwater to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or to waters of the United States to determine if the discharger is complying with all requirements of this article, and with any state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement. Dischargers shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and for the performance of any additional duties. Dischargers shall make available to the director, upon request, any SWPPP's, modifications thereto, self-inspection reports, monitoring records, compliance evaluations, Notices of Intent, and any other records, reports, and other documents related to compliance with this article and with any state or federal discharge permit. 
(b)  Where a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director or authorized representatives will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing his responsibilities. 
(c)  The director shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the discharger's operations. 
(d)  The director may require any discharger to the MS4 or waters of the United States to conduct specified sampling, testing, analysis, and other monitoring of its stormwater discharges, and may specify the frequency and parameters of any such required monitoring. 
(e)  The director may require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary at the discharger's expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(f)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the discharger at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the discharger. 
(g)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the discharger's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-211), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-173. - Search warrants. 
    If the director, or authorized representative, has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or any state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, the director of community development, the city engineer, the director of public works, the director of parks and the duly authorized representatives of these city departmental directors are declared to be "health officers," as that term is used in Vernon's Ann. C.C.P. art. 18.05. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-212), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-174. - Reports of violations. 
(a)  Citizen reports. All citizens are encouraged to report any spills, releases, illicit connections, other instances of anyone discharging pollutants into the MS4 or waters of the United States, and any other violation of this article of which they become aware, to the director, his delegate, or any person designated by the city manager to receive such citizen reports. 
(b)  Methods of citizen reports. Such citizen reports may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. A written record of each citizen report to the city will be prepared and kept on file for a period of three years, and a copy of the city's record of the report will be furnished to the reporting citizen upon request. Also upon request, the city engineer or other responsible city official will inform the reporting citizen of any action undertaken by the city in response to the citizen's report. 
(c)  Reports by owners and operators. The operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity shall report any spills, releases, illicit connections, or other instances where pollutants are discharged into the MS4 or waters of the United States and any other violation of this article for which they are responsible to the director, his delegate, or any person designated by the city manager to receive such reports. 
(d)  Reporting requirements. The operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity shall report all incidents enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, in accordance with the following: 
(1)  A hazardous and/or toxic material spill or release shall be immediately reported to the city fire department. 
(2)  Other instances where pollutants are discharged into the MS4 or waters of the United States by spill, release, illicit connections or other means shall be reported to the pollution control officer within the department of engineering/environmental management. 
(e)  Notification responsibilities of operators and owners. Both the operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity which has resulted in a spill or release of hazardous/toxic materials or a substance of a polluting nature is responsible for proper notification of the incident to the appropriate county, state, and federal agency. The reporting of a spill/release to the city does not release the owner or operator from reporting to appropriate county, state and federal officials. Thus, dependent on the type of release and the nature of the emergency caused thereby (i.e., life threatening or no), the following agencies, in addition to the city environmental/health department, are specified to be notified: 
(1)  City fire department; 
(2)  City police department; 
(3)  City street division; 
(4)  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality; and 
(5)  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-213), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-175. - Warning notice. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-214), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-176. - Notification of violation. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Within ten calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the alleged violator to the director. If the alleged violator denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the notice. Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with any provision in this article or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 82-177-82-179 and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-215), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-177. - Show cause hearing. 
    The director may order any person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, to appear before the director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the alleged violator specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the alleged violator show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the alleged violator. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the rights and procedures specified in section 82-182(g). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the alleged violator. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-216), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-178. - Compliance orders. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to the violator directing that the violator come into compliance within a specified time limit, prior to commencement or continuance of operation, or immediately. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged, to the MS4 and waters of the United States. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established by a state or federal standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-217), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-179. - Remediation, abatement, and restoration orders. 
    When the director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, and that such violation has adversely affected the MS4, or the waters of the United States, the director may issue an order to the violator directing him to undertake and implement any appropriate action to remediate and/or abate any adverse effects of the violation upon the MS4, or the waters of the United Stares, and/or to restore any part of the MS4, or the waters of the United States. Such remedial, abatement, and restoration action may include, but not be limited to: monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the adverse effects and determination of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and/or restoration action; confinement, removal, cleanup, treatment, and disposal of any discharged or released pollution or contamination; prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any damage to the public health, welfare, or the environment that may result from the violation; restoration or replacement of city property or natural resources damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement, and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be completed within a specified period of time. An order issued under this section does not relieve the violator of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any responsible party. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-218), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-180. - Emergency cease and desist orders. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation, or threatened violation, have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the director may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this article; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The director may allow the person to commence or recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-219), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-181. - Stop work orders. 
    Whenever the director finds that any operator of a construction site has violated, threatens to violate, or continues to violate, any provision of sections 82-167-82-170, or any order issued hereunder, the director may issue a stop work order to the operator, and require that a copy of the stop work order be posted at the construction site and distributed to all city departments and divisions whose decisions affect any activity at the site. Unless express written exception is made by the director, the stop work order shall prohibit any further construction activity, or any commencement of construction activity, at the site and shall bar any further inspection or approval by the city associated with a building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction or to assume occupancy at the site. Issuance of a stop work order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. B-652, § 2(5-220), 8-10-2000) 
Sec. 82-182. - Reconsideration and hearing. 
(a)  Petition for reconsideration. Any person subject to a compliance order under section 82-178, a remediation, abatement, or restoration order under section 82-179, an emergency cease and desist order under section 82-180, or a stop work order under section 82-181 may petition the director to reconsider the basis for his order within 15 calendar days of the affected person's notice of issuance of such an order. 
(b)  Failure to submit petition deemed waiver. Failure to submit a timely written petition for reconsideration shall be deemed to be a waiver of any further right to administrative reconsideration or review of the order. 
(c)  Enumeration of objectives. In its petition, the petitioning party must indicate the provisions of the order objected to, the reasons for the objection, any facts that are contested, the evidence that supports the petitioner's view of the facts, any alternative terms of an order that the petitioner would accept, and whether the petitioning party requests a hearing on its petition. 
(d)  Effect of director's orders. The effect of any compliance order under section 82-178, remediation, abatement, or restoration order under section 82-179, and any stop work order under section 82-181 shall be stayed pending the director's reconsideration of the petition, and any hearing thereon, unless the director expressly makes a written determination to the contrary. The effectiveness of any emergency cease and desist order under section 82-180 shall not be stayed pending the director's reconsideration, or any hearing thereon, unless the director expressly and in writing stays his emergency order. 
(e)  Action by director; time limit. Within 30 calendar days of the submittal of a petition for reconsideration, the director shall grant the petition and withdraw or modify the order accordingly; deny the petition without a hearing if no material issue of fact is raised; or if a hearing has been requested and a material issue of fact has been raised, set a hearing on the petition. 
(f)  Notice of hearing; service. Written notice of any hearing set by the director pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be served on the petitioning party personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing.

If the city council finds that the public necessity and convenience do not require the operation of any additional taxicabs or that the applicant is not fit to conduct such business for any reason, or that the interest of the general public in the city will best be served by the refusal of such application, then it shall forthwith refuse such application and no grant shall be made to such applicant.

In the event of such a suspension, then from and after the time of said suspension, and for the duration of such suspension, said grant or franchise shall be of no force and effect and the holder thereof shall not be authorized to operate taxicabs in the city. For good cause, the city council may, by formal action, lessen or terminate any such period of suspension. 
(b)  If the holder of any franchise shall show by such holder's actions that such holder is not a fit and proper person to operate taxicabs in the city or if the financial position of said holder shall reach such a condition that the city council does not deem said holder able to pay in full reasonable claims for damages which might be legally established and confirmed, or if for good and sufficient reason the general welfare of the citizens of the city will best be served by such action, the city council may, after a hearing set out below, revoke, repeal and cancel any franchise or grant made to such holder under the terms of this article. In the event of such revocation, repeal and cancellation, said grant shall be thereafter completely null and void and of no further force and effect. However, the hearing specified above shall not be held until notice has been given to the holder of the grant in question of said hearing by certified mail addressed to said holder at the address shown on the records of the city and a period of at least five days has elapsed since the mailing of such notice. Further, such notice shall specify the time and place of the hearing and shall list the reasons the general welfare of the city requires the revocation and cancellation of such grant. The holder of the grant in question shall be allowed to be present at such hearing, which shall be public, and shall be allowed to be represented by counsel, if the holder deems the same advisable. The holder shall have full opportunity to disprove any charges and allegations set out against such holder or holder's operations in said notice. Said hearing may be conducted by the city council or any agent, employee or representative designated by it. If conducted by an agent, employee or representative, then upon approval and adoption of the city council of findings of fact made by the persons conducting such hearing, said findings of fact so approved and adopted shall be and become the findings of the city council. If the findings of fact made after such a hearing show that the operator is not a fit and proper person to conduct such business, or is unable to pay in full reasonable claims for damages which might be asserted, or that for any reason the general welfare of the citizens of the city or the best interests of the city will be served best by such action, then the city council shall revoke, repeal, and cancel the franchise in question.

The city council and planning and zoning commission, as applicable, shall have the authority to consider requests for waivers of regulations contained in this ordinance. The council or commission may approve, disapprove or modify such a request provided that such approval or modification will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or be injurious to other property. The developer shall provide information to support a claim that there are extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties which may result from strict compliance with the regulation or that the public interest may be better served by an alternative proposal. 
No waiver shall be granted unless the council or commission finds that: 
1.  The requirement places an unreasonable burden on the development and does not bear a rough proportionality to the requirements necessary to serve the development; or 
2.  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance and/or the design standards manual would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the applicant's land; and 
3.  The modification, exception or waiver is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and 
4.  The granting of the modification, exception or waiver will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and the design standards manual. 
Such findings of the city council or planning and zoning commission, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the city council meeting(s) at which such waiver is granted. Pecuniary hardship to the developer, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.

Sec. 2.1 - Plat approval required. 
    It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or corporation owning a tract of land located within the corporate limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Burleson, Texas, to hereafter divide the same tract of land into two or more parts to lay out a subdivision; to lay out a building lot; or to lay out a street, alley, square, park, or other parts of the tract intended to be dedicated to public use; or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the streets, alleys, squares, parks, or other parts for purpose of development without having a plat of the subdivision prepared and approved in accordance with this ordinance. A division of a tract includes a division regardless of whether it is made by using a metes and bounds description in a deed of conveyance or in a contract for a deed, by using a contract of sale or other executory contract to convey, or by using any other method for purpose of development. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to any development which is intended as a single lot, tract or parcel where a primary structure will be located. Furthermore, the following shall be applicable to all subdivisions of land:

A.  Residential structures. A building permit for an addition to, or renovation of, an existing residential structure may be issued on an unplatted lot, provided the value of such proposed construction, including the cumulative value of any proposed and all previously permitted building permits on the primary structure, does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the original structure, excluding the value of the land. Building permits as used herein do not include electrical, plumbing or similar non-construction activities. 
B.  Nonresidential structures. A building permit for an addition to, or renovation of, an existing non-residential structure may be issued on an unplatted lot, provided the value of such proposed construction, including the cumulative value of any proposed and all previously permitted building permits on the primary structure, does not exceed 50 percent of the value of the original structure, excluding the value of the land.

2.  No application shall be deemed complete and accepted for processing unless it is accompanied by all documents required by and prepared in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. For a determination of completeness to be issued, an application must include the following: 
a.  A completed application form signed by the owner and the owner's authorized agent, if applicable; 
b.  Every item, study and document required by this ordinance for the type of plat being submitted; and 
c.  A nonrefundable application submittal fee, as specified in the fee schedule. 
3.  The city manager and/or the directors of community and economic development and public works may from time to time identify additional requirements for a complete application that are not contained within but are consistent with the application contents and standards set forth in this ordinance. 
4.  A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Determination of completeness and expiration. 
1.  Not later than the tenth business day after the date an application is submitted, the director of community and economic development shall make a written determination whether the application constitutes a complete application. This shall include a determination that all information and documents required by the subdivision and development ordinance for the type of plat being submitted have been submitted. A determination that the application is incomplete shall be mailed to the applicant within such time period by certified mail at the address listed on the application. The determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall state that the application will expire if the document or other information is not submitted within 45 days after the date the application was submitted. 
2.  An application for approval of the type of plat submitted on or after the effective date of this ordinance shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day after the application has been received, if the applicant has not otherwise been notified that the application is incomplete. For purposes of this section, the applicant shall be deemed to have been notified if the city has mailed a copy of the determination as provided in subsection 4. 
3.  The processing of an application by any city employee prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the city as the official acceptance of the application for filing. The incompleteness of an application shall be grounds for denial of the application regardless of whether a determination of incompleteness was mailed to the applicant. 
4.  An application for any type of plat approval shall be deemed to expire on the 45th day after the application is submitted to the city for processing if the applicant fails to provide documents or other information necessary to meet the requirements of the subdivision and development ordinance as specified in the determination provided to the applicant. Upon expiration, the application will be returned to the applicant together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new application for approval of the plat must be submitted. 
5.  No vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to this section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 2.6 - Procedures for approval of subdivisions. 
A.  Development assistance committee (DAC) comments. All plats accepted for review shall be examined by the DAC for compliance with city ordinances. The DAC may make comments to assist the developer in meeting the requirements of the ordinance. The plat will be forwarded to the commission and council for consideration along with any DAC comments that have not been addressed. All DAC comments must be addressed or waived through a variance request before the plat will be recorded. Failure of the DAC to make specific comments does not relieve the property owner from compliance with all ordinances. 
1.  The plat will be forwarded to the commission either upon determination of compliance with all DAC comments, or with outstanding DAC comments and a request for the commission to approve subject to the DAC comments. 
2.  Appeals to ordinance requirements shall be submitted in writing to the administrative official. 
B.  Schedule. The plat shall be scheduled for consideration by the commission and city council within 30 days after the date the plat application is accepted. The plat application is considered accepted upon the determination that the plat either meets the ordinance or a variance to an ordinance requirement has been requested by the applicant and when all application fees are paid. 
Plats shall be approved or disapproved within the time frame established by chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government Code, unless the applicant voluntarily requests in writing that action on the plat be tabled or continued. 
C.  Plats with reserved authority comments. The commission shall have no power to act on matters of reserved authority. If a plat with appealed reserved authority comments is recommended for approval by the commission, it shall be sent to the council for action within 30 days after the commission's action on the plat. For the purposes of joint authority over appealed reserved authority comments, the commission shall be deemed to concur with the action of the council. 
D.  Modifications or conditions. Where the city finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve modifications of conditions to these platting regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such a finding by the city shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these platting regulations. 
E.  Record maintenance. The administrative official shall maintain a record of each application submitted under this ordinance, and the action taken on the application. On written request by a property owner of an affected tract, the administrative official shall certify the reasons for the action taken on the application. 
F.  Dedication offers. All streets, drainage ways, parks, and other rights-of-way or public easements shown within a subdivision plat and intended for public use shall be offered for dedication as part of the approval of a plat. Upon approval of the subdivision application by the city, the offers shall be deemed dedicated and available for acceptance by the city in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
1.  Whenever a subdivision proposes the dedication of land for public use and the city finds that such land is not required or is not suitable for public use, the city may either deny the subdivision application or require the rearrangement of lots to include such land. 
2.  The approval of a subdivision plat by the city is not considered an acceptance of any dedication and does not impose on the city any duty regarding the maintenance or improvement of any dedicated parts until the city makes an actual appropriation of the dedicated parts by entry, use, or improvement. 
3.  Disapproval of a plat shall be deemed a refusal by the city to accept the offered dedications shown thereon. 
G.  Nuisance ordinances and outstanding liens. A subdivision plat shall not be approved in which the property being considered for development is in violation of a public nuisance ordinance of the City of Burleson. No subdivision plat shall be approved that has an outstanding delinquent lien payable to the City of Burleson. 
H.  Delinquent taxes. A subdivision plat shall not be approved in which the property being considered for development has delinquent taxes due. 
I.  Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land in an adjacent city, the administrative official shall coordinate the review of the plat with the adjacent city and the planning and zoning commission may require written approval from the adjacent city. 
J.  Enforcement of ordinance. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the city and its officers shall have the right to enjoin any violation of this ordinance by injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

ARTICLE 4 - COMMUNITY FACILITIES POLICY (PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE) 

Sec. 4.1 - Basic policy. 
    This article provides general and miscellaneous policies for the construction of community facilities (public infrastructure) by a developer. Articles 5-8 provide requirements and policies for the construction of the specific types of community facilities. A community facilities contract shall be executed by the city, the developer and the contractor whenever a developer constructs community facilities within the city or the ETJ. All costs associated with the construction of the community facilities are the responsibility of the developer unless the city council agrees to participate in oversize facilities as specified in section 4.2, city participation and reimbursement. The following items are generally considered community facilities unless agreements are created to allow private infrastructure: 
A.  Local streets and thoroughfares. 
B.  Sidewalks. 
C.  Trails and other walkways within public parks. 
D.  Storm drain facilities. 
E.  Water facilities. 
F.  Sanitary sewer facilities. 
Other items not included on the above list may be classified as community facilities by the public works director. The process for the execution of a community facilities contract is included in section 4.4, community facilities contract policy and required fees. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 4.2 - City participation and reimbursement. 
    All costs associated with the design, right-of-way, and construction of community facilities shall be the responsibility of the developer. However, the city may participate in the oversizing of facilities when the size of the facility required by the city exceeds the developer's responsibility to provide adequate community facilities. 
A.  Participation in thoroughfare construction. The city may participate in the construction of roadways included on the master thoroughfare plan in the following instances: 
1.  Internal streets. 
a.  When a street shown on the master thoroughfare plan is located within the boundary of a subdivision, the city may participate in the design and construction cost of the roadway when the required width exceeds 40 feet (major collector classification and above). The city council may agree to fund the design and construction of the width in excess of 40 feet. Right-of-way for the entire width must be dedicated by the developer. 
b.  Should the city council deny the request for the participation, the developer shall be required to dedicate the right-of-way for the full width as required by the thoroughfare plan and the developer will coordinate with the public works director to determine the street section that will allow future widening that will be most convenient for the city. 
c.  The city will not participate if the trip generation of the subdivision warrants the construction of the full width of the street with the subdivision. 
2.  Perimeter streets and offsite streets. 
a.  When a street shown on the master thoroughfare plan is located along the perimeter of the subdivision and the street is required to provide access to the development, the city may participate in the design and construction cost of the roadway when the required width exceeds 40 feet (major collector classification and above); or 
b.  The developer may construct one-half of the roadway (24-foot minimum). 
c.  If the perimeter street is not required to provide access to the subdivision, the developer may place funds in escrow with the city in accordance with section 4.3, escrow. 
d.  The city will not participate if the trip generation of the subdivision warrants the construction of the full width of the roadway with the subdivision. 
B.  Participation in water improvements. The city may participate in the costs associated with construction of onsite or offsite water improvements when the improvements shown in the city's water and wastewater master plan exceed the size required by the subdivision or when an analysis of the specific area shows a larger required size than would be required by the subdivision if constructed alone. If the size of the required waterline is 12 inches or smaller, the full cost of the water improvements shall be paid by the developer. If the size of the waterline is greater than 12 inches, the city may pay the extra size cost above a 12-inch main. 
C.  Sewer improvements. The city may participate in the costs associated with construction of onsite and offsite sanitary sewer improvements when the improvements shown in the city's water and wastewater master plan exceed the size required by the subdivision or when an analysis of the specific area shows a larger required size than would be required by the subdivision alone. If the size of the required sewer is 15 inches or smaller, the full cost of the sewer improvements shall be paid by the developer. If the size of the sanitary sewer line is greater than 15 inches, the city may pay the extra size cost above a 15-inch main. 
D.  Participation procedure. 
1.  All participation approval is based on the availability of funds. If funds are not available, the public works director will determine the size of the community facilities. The city may not require installation of thoroughfares wider than 40 feet, water lines larger than 12 inches and sewer lines larger than 15 inches unless the subdivision requires larger lines if constructed alone. 
2.  The city may participate with the developer in an amount up to 30 percent of the total cost of the project without using the competitive bidding process. If the amount of the participation exceeds 30 percent of the total cost of the project, the city must receive competitive, sealed bids in accordance with the bidding policies used for city capital improvement projects. 
3.  In order for the city to participate in the oversizing of community facilities, the following must occur: 
a.  The developer must submit engineering construction plans for the subdivision. 
b.  The developer must submit a letter requesting city participation and include the reason for the request. The request must include a proposal showing the difference in cost of the community facilities if constructed in accordance with the master thoroughfare plan and/or water and wastewater master plan and the cost of the facilities required by the subdivision if constructed alone. The letter shall be submitted prior to the start of construction of the community facilities for the subdivision. 
c.  The public works director will review the letter and proposal and negotiate the participation amount with the developer. The public works director will determine if funds are available for the participation. If funds are not available, the request will not be forwarded to the city council and the public works director will determine the appropriate size of the community facilities. 
d.  The public works director will present the request to the city council. The participation amount presented to the city council will be considered final. Staff will not resubmit a revised participation request to council unless there has been a change in scope. Errors in the participation request will not be considered by city council. 
e.  The city council will vote on the participation request and the public works director will notify the developer of the decision in writing. 
f.  If the participation request is approved, the city will execute a community facilities contract with the developer and contractor. The developer shall initially defray the entire cost of the oversized facility, unless the city council determines otherwise. The city, following dedication and initial acceptance of the constructed facility, shall reimburse the developer the amount approved by the city council. The community facilities contract shall contain a performance bond, regardless of the cost of the improvements. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 4.3 - Escrow. 
A.  When land within the city is developed or subdivided adjacent to existing unimproved or substandard community facilities, or adjacent to community facilities proposed in the water and wastewater master plan or master thoroughfare plan (including associated drainage), the developer shall construct or improve the part of the community facilities necessary to serve the development or subdivision in conformance with the master plan unless the city determines that one of the following methods is more appropriate for the provision of the design and construction or improvement of the community facilities. 
1.  The city elects to construct or improve the community facilities under the assessment policy; or 
2.  The city determines that the improvements fall under the requirements of the community facilities improvement policy; or 
3.  The city determines that the construction or improvement of the community facility is not feasible or prudent at the time of the development or subdivision of the land and the developer should be required to place funds in escrow as provided in paragraph [B] below. 
B.  As provided in paragraph A.3 above, the city may require the developer to place funds in escrow for the design and construction, or improvement of the part of the community facilities that is necessary to serve the development or subdivision. The developer's share of the cost of such part of the community facilities shall be roughly proportional to the burden the development or subdivision places on the public infrastructure system. 
1.  Escrow shall be paid prior to filing the plat with the county. 
2.  Should the owner construct or improve the community facility for which the owner paid escrow, the owner shall be refunded the escrow paid, plus interest accrued. 
3.  Once the owner has paid escrow in full for any community facility, the owner is relieved of any further obligation for that community facility, unless its construction or improvement is necessary to provide adequate public facilities for a phase of the development or subdivision. 
4.  Escrow requirements shall be based upon unit costs for comparable contracts awarded by the city over the previous year. If none exist, the escrow rate shall equal the current market value of construction and design at the time the escrow deposit is due. 
5.  All escrow funds shall be paid in cash and shall be held in the name of the city and deposited into an escrow fund in the city's depository. 
6.  All interest earned will accrue to the initial escrow deposit and will be used for the design and construction or improvement of the community facilities. Should the cost of the community facilities be less than the amount of escrow placed with the city, the difference shall not be refunded to the developer. Similarly, should the cost of the community facilities exceed the amount placed in escrow, the developer shall not be required to pay the difference. 
7.  When developments are phased, the escrow requirement shall be established at the time the preliminary plat is approved through the establishment of an escrow contract. The escrow contract shall establish the developer's share of the design and construction for those community facilities the city determines are not feasible or prudent to construct or improve when the land is developed or subdivided. The developer's share required for each final plat shall be placed in escrow with the city and shall be based upon the land area contained within the final plat divided by the land area contained within the preliminary plat times the calculated developer's share. The escrow rate used to calculate the escrow requirement for any final plat shall be the escrow rate in effect at the time of the preliminary plat. Design, construction, or improvement of the community facility by persons other than the developer shall not relieve the developer of escrow requirements for phases final platted subsequent to the design, construction, or improvement of the community facility. The escrow contract shall be a covenant and restriction running with the land. The escrow contract shall be signed by the developer, the owner of the land, and the city. The escrow contract shall be filed in the property records of the county where the land is located. 
8.  All escrow funds deposited with the city prior to the effective date of this policy shall remain on deposit under the original escrow contract and addenda. The methodology used to calculate the amount of these funds shall not be superseded by the methodology contained herein. 
C.  When an individual property owner desires to obtain a building permit to construct a residence or building on a previously platted tract or lot that abuts an existing unimproved or substandard community facility, or where a community facility is planned, and where escrow has not been deposited for this section of community facility, the property owner shall place on deposit with the city the estimated cost of the public facilities adjacent to the tract or lot, to be determined at then current construction costs. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 4.4 - Community facilities contract policy. 
    Standard community facilities contracts, executed by the contractor, the developer and the city, are required for all public infrastructure construction. The standard community facilities contract document is provided in appendix 9.1. Changes to the community facilities contract document will be made by city council resolution. The following is a summary of the process for the execution of a community facilities contract: 
A.  All engineering construction plans will be prepared and community facilities constructed in accordance with the City of Burleson Design Standard Manual. 
B.  A community facilities contract is required for all infrastructure construction within the city and the ETJ. A community facilities contract is required for private street and drainage construction. 
C.  Engineering construction plans for community facilities are required as follows: 
1.  A developer, at the time the final plat is submitted, will submit final engineering plans for the construction of community facilities to the public works director. The developer shall retain a civil engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Texas, for preparation of the engineering plans. 
2.  Approval of construction plans is not required prior to planning and zoning commission and city council action on a final plat. No plat shall be recorded with Johnson or Tarrant County until such time as necessary construction plans have been accepted and a community facilities contract executed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this ordinance. 
3.  The public works director will review the plans and return them to the developer for any needed changes within 20 working days from the time of submittal. 
4.  After any required changes have been made, the developer shall resubmit the revised final engineering plans for acceptance by the public works director. 
D.  Waivers to the provisions of the subdivision and development ordinance or design standards manual shall be processed in accordance with section 1.5, waivers of this ordinance. All waiver requests shall be approved prior to construction of the community facilities. 
E.  Upon acceptance of the plans, the developer may enter into a contract with a utility contractor provided that the construction and installation of the facilities shall be viewed by inspectors of the city to see that the installation is made in accordance with the drawings and the city's specifications which, in every instance, shall be a part of said installation contract. 
F.  Upon approval of the plat by the city council and submittal of required documents for the construction of the community facilities, the administrative official will prepare three copies of the community facilities contract for execution by the city, the developer and the contractor. Construction of community facilities may commence following the execution of the community facilities contract, posting of the applicable bonds within the community facilities contract, payment of fees and any other requirements of the community facilities contract. 
G.  After the community facilities contract has been prepared, it must be executed by the developer, the contractor and the city. The mayor will sign the contract on behalf of the city. 
H.  Grading of the site may occur following preliminary plat approval of the subdivision upon approval of an early grading permit. All erosion protection measures must be installed prior to any grading activities. 
I.  No community facilities construction may begin before a community facilities contract is approved by the city and a notice to proceed has been issued by the public works director. 
J.  Community facilities contracts not completed within a two-year time period will require renewal of the contract with all updated documents being in compliance with the policies in effect at that time. Any facilities or requirements included in the contract that are not completed by the developer within two years may be completed by the city at the developer's expense as provided through an acceptable means of financial security as provided in the community facilities contract. 
K.  After execution of the community facilities contract by the developer, contractor and the city, any significant changes in the contract, or the plans or specifications that alter the scope of the project will require an amendment to the community facilities contract which will include modifications of the bonds and may require additional payment of developer's contract fees. 
L.  After construction and initial acceptance by the city, the developer's engineer shall furnish one copy "as-built" set of drawings to the city along within an AutoCAD file of the "as-built drawing. The final construction of the community facilities shall be field verified to ensure they are within the dedicated right-of-way or easement. If the facility does not lie within a city right-of-way or easement, the developer shall have an instrument prepared for filing to coincide with the actual line location. The instrument will be filed by the city in the county deed records. Any such installation, when made, shall become the property of the city, free and clear of all encumbrances, following expiration of the maintenance bond. 
M.  Construction must start within three years of the city's acceptance of the construction plans. Plans for projects which have not started construction within this time must be resubmitted for a new review. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008)

(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 4.7 - Easements. 
A.  Easements dedicated by plat. When possible, easements shall be dedicated on the plat. Easements shall be dedicated for the purposes indicated by their description including, but not limited to, the installation and maintenance of water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, drainage, electricity, telephone, gas and cable television. When possible, easements shall be dedicated for the exclusive use of water, sanitary sewer or drainage rather than as blanket "utility easements". Owner shall have the right to use the easements, provided, however, that it does not unreasonably interfere with or impede the provision of the services to others. Ingress and egress is granted on, over and across all public easements for the benefit of the provider of services for which the easements are granted. 
B.  Easements by separate instrument. When easements have not been filed by plat for community facilities or when it is necessary to install community facilities offsite from a subdivision, easements must be filed by separate instrument. The developer is responsible for providing to the city a metes and bounds description and exhibit sealed by a licensed surveyor and an executed dedication statement on the city's standard form. The city will file the easement with the appropriate county upon receipt of the filing fees from the developer. 
C.  Easement maintenance. Routine maintenance (mowing, cleaning, etc.) of easement areas is the responsibility of the owner of the property on which the easement is contained. The city will only maintain the function of the easement. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 4.8 - Ownership and maintenance. 
    All community facilities constructed within dedicated public rights-of-way or public easements shall be and shall remain the property of the city and, after expiration of the maintenance bonds, shall be maintained by the city, except as otherwise required by this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
ARTICLE 5. - STREET AND RIGHT-OF-WAY REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 5.1 - Street and right-of-way basic policies. 
A.  Streets and right-of-way shall conform to the master thoroughfare plan, the design standards manual, and the standards in this ordinance. 
B.  The developer shall design and construct adequate roadway facilities, whether onsite or offsite. The developer shall be responsible for all costs associated with meeting the requirements of this ordinance. 
C.  An adequate offsite street and thoroughfare system shall be designed and constructed in order to: 
1.  Provide for streets of suitable location, width, or other improvements to accommodate existing traffic, traffic anticipated from the development and traffic anticipated from other developments impacting the same roadways; 
2.  Afford satisfactory access to adjoining properties; and 
3.  Accommodate police, firefighting, sanitation, and street maintenance equipment. 
D.  The proposed streets of the development shall be effectively related to the present and future street system and to the development of the surrounding area in order to assure continuity of thoroughfares, coordination of intersections, the limitation of median breaks, and the promotion of livable neighborhoods. 
1.  The plat shall provide for appropriate continuation or termination of any existing streets, whether constructed or dedicated, which extend to the limits of the proposed subdivision. 
2.  Adequate provision of access to adjoining lands shall be made. 
3.  In order to foster livable neighborhoods, local streets and minor collectors internal to a neighborhood shall be designed to discourage traffic from traveling directly through a neighborhood and shall discourage high speeds through neighborhoods. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.2 - Thoroughfare adequacy determination and traffic study requirements. 
A.  Adequacy of offsite roadway network required. 
1.  Adequacy required. Prior to plat approval, the city shall determine whether the roadway network serving the development to be platted has adequate capacity to accommodate existing traffic, traffic reasonably anticipated from the development and traffic reasonably anticipated from other developments approved or to be approved within a reasonable period of time. The city's determination shall be based on information provided by the developer in the plat application and supporting studies, unless the study is waived. 
2.  Analysis of adequacy. 
a.  For any property submitted for platting that meets the criteria contained in this section, the public works director shall require that the developer provide, at the developer's expense, a traffic study that analyzes the adequacy of the roadway network to serve the development. 
b.  Adequate capacity of the roadway network shall be determined as described in section 3.6.B of the design standards manual. 
3.  Determination of adequacy. The roadway network shall be deemed adequate only if each existing link of the network has sufficient capacity and adequate roadway conditions. 
4.  Determination of inadequacy. In the event that the traffic study shows a result of a level of service "D", "E" or "F", as defined in the highway capacity manual, or the public works director determines that the offsite roadway network serving the development to be platted is not adequate, the following shall be provided: 
a.  Proposed solutions to transportation deficiencies resulting from the proposed subdivision; 
b.  The degree of local congestion; 
c.  The availability of alternate routes to service the increased traffic; and 
d.  The degree to which the increased congestion is attributable to the proposed development. 
5.  Action. After the information has been reviewed, the city may do any of the following: 
a.  Disapprove the plat or zone change request; 
b.  Require that development of the property be phased to coordinate the timing of building permits with the provision of adequate capacity; or 
c.  Require the developer, in lieu of denial or phasing of the plat, to construct any offsite or onsite improvements to city standards or as otherwise permitted by the public works director to provide adequate capacity for the roadway network. Construction may be required utilizing standards in excess of the master thoroughfare plan or typical city standards. 
B.  Traffic study requirements. 
1.  Traffic study required. A traffic study, including a traffic impact analysis, shall be required for a plat meeting the following criteria: 
a.  Over 100 trips during the peak hour. A traffic impact analysis shall be required for a development when the expected traffic generation exceeds 100 trips during the peak hour of the development (typically a.m., noon, p.m. and/or weekend). 
b.  Over 1,000 trips per day. Developments expected to generate more than 1,000 trips per day, but less than 100 trips during the peak hour may be required to submit a traffic impact analysis at the city's discretion. 
c.  Waiver of traffic study. The public works director may waive the requirement for a traffic study. A written request for a waiver of the traffic study and any supporting documents must be submitted to the public works director at the time of plat application. 
2.  Traffic study submittal. The traffic study shall be prepared in accordance with the appropriate section of chapter 3 of the design standards manual. 
3.  Revisions to traffic study. Prior to forwarding any plat to the commission, the traffic study shall be accepted by the public works director. The acceptance of the traffic study will be based on the completeness of the traffic study, the thoroughness of the impact evaluation, and the consistency of the study with the proposed access and development plan. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.3 - Requirements for access to the street network. 
A.  Acquisition of access required. Each lot shall have access to a public street or access easement. The developer shall acquire right-of-way or necessary easements for and construct any offsite roadways and access ways necessary to connect the development with an adequate offsite roadway network. The developer shall be responsible for the acquisition of all required offsite easements. If the developer is unable to acquire the necessary offsite easement, the city shall be provided with easement or right-of way survey documents and exhibits, documentation, including evidence of a reasonable offer made to the affected property owner. Upon receiving a written request for assistance, the city may, at its option, acquire these easements either through negotiations or through condemnation in appropriate situations. The developer shall reimburse the city for the costs of acquiring the necessary easements including but not limited to attorney fees. 
B.  Residential access limited. 
1.  Arterial streets. No single family, townhouse or duplex residential development shall have direct access to an arterial street unless no other means of access is available. In cases where access is permitted, a private access easement adjacent to the thoroughfare may be required. Any lot that has direct access to an arterial street is required to provide head-out egress. 

2.  Major collectors. Single family, townhome, or duplex residential lots may have direct driveway access to major collectors provided the following development standards are met: 
a.  Drive separation shall be a minimum of 240 feet with shared driveways, 
b.  Head out egress must be provided. 
Single-family or duplex residential lots may also access major collectors using private access easements with connection spacing to the major collector no less than 240 feet. 
C.  Private access easements. Private access easements may be required between or across any lots fronting on arterial or major collector streets in order to minimize the total number of access points along those streets, and to facilitate traffic flow between lots. The location and dimensions of the easement shall be determined by the public works director at the time of platting or development. A note shall be provided on the plat indicating the lots served by the private access easement. 
D.  Maintenance of private access easements. Maintenance of any private access easement is the responsibility of the property owner. When an easement is created by plat, the plat dedication statement shall include language, approved as to form by the city attorney, acknowledging maintenance responsibility. When an easement is created by separate instrument, the developer shall enter into an agreement, which shall be filed with the county that provides for the continuing maintenance of the easement by the property owner. 
E.  Access prohibition lines. Where a subdivision will abut or contain an existing or proposed arterial, major collector, or frontage road, certain segments of the street may not be suitable for private or public access points to maintain safe and efficient traffic movement. In these cases, access prohibition lines shall be required on the plat, as determined by the public works director. 
F.  Prohibited turning movements. For the benefit of traffic safety and flow on arterial and major collector streets, access points may be required to prohibit certain types of turning movements as determined by the public works director. 
G.  Signalization required. Signalization of access points on arterial or collector roadways may be required in order to provide safe and efficient traffic flow. The developer shall be responsible for any design, right-of-way, utility relocation and construction costs required for a traffic signal installation necessitated by a development, as determined by the public works director. If the need for the signal has not occurred at the time of platting or if, at the time of site development the city determines that construction of the facilities is not feasible, the developer shall make a payment in lieu of construction equal to the developer's share of the construction costs plus estimated engineering costs. Payment shall be made prior to filing the plat. 
H.  Adequate access. Each residential subdivision shall have at least two constructed points of public ingress and egress, except: 
1.  When the number of units with one constructed point of street ingress and egress is 30 or less. 
2.  The public works director and the fire marshal may approve up to 40 units, when requested. In evaluating a request, factors such as the timing of construction of other public improvements that provide a second point of access, public safety, and convenience shall be considered. 
3.  The city council may grant a waiver to these regulations for more than 40 units with one point of access when unique topographic or infill circumstances exist. 
I.  Rear entry access. The city may require the developer to provide for rear entry access to lots from a private access easement to benefit traffic safety in areas of higher residential density development. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.4 - Street layout requirements. 
A.  Intersections. 
1.  No street intersecting an arterial or collector street shall vary from a 90 degree angle of intersection by more than ten degrees, unless otherwise approved by the director of public works. The director of public works may require a visibility analysis for any intersection. 
2.  The number of minor collector or local street offsets shall be minimized but, when approved, a minimum centerline offset distance of 125 feet shall be used. 
3.  There shall be a minimum of 600 feet between intersections of local or minor collector streets and arterial or major collector streets. 
4.  Arterial streets shall be intersected only by collector streets or other arterial streets, unless the only means of ingress and egress to a subdivision is from such arterial street. In this event, the street intersection shall be configured in accordance with the following figure. All costs associated with the construction of this flare configuration shall be borne by the developer. 

Local/Arterial Street Transition
5.  Visibility easements, as required by the design standards manual, shall be dedicated at the intersection of all public streets. 
B.  Block length. The following standards shall be followed in the design of residential blocks. 
1.  Block lengths and cul-de-sacs shall be appropriate to the density and type of development as follows: 
a.  If utilizing residential streets 31 feet in width, the maximum block length shall be 900 feet with a maximum of 30 lots. 
b.  If utilizing rural standards, the maximum block length shall be 1,200 feet with a maximum of 30 lots. 
2.  Alternative block lengths. 
a.  The director of community and economic development and public works director may approve alternate block lengths under the following conditions: 
(1)  Proximity to a railway, expressway, waterway; 
(2)  Topographic features; 
(3)  Design considerations for a planned development that generate the need for an alternative block length; or 
(4)  An infill development with no alternate access. 
b.  When considering a request, the director of community and economic development and public works director shall consider the following: 
(1)  Alternative designs which would reduce block length; 
(2)  The effect of long blocks on access, congestion and delivery of municipal services; and 
(3)  Means of mitigation, including, but not limited to mid-block turnarounds, limitation on the number of lots to be created and served, temporary points of access, and additional fire protection measures. 
3.  Curvilinear design requirements. 
a.  Purpose for curvilinear streets. Local and minor collector streets shall be designed with curvature for the following purposes: 
(1)  Fit the road to natural topography; 
(2)  Avoid monotony of lot appearance; 
(3)  Reduce speeds through neighborhoods; and 
(4)  Discourage through-traffic intrusions by eliminating straight views from one block to the next. 
b.  Curvilinear standards. Local and minor collector streets shall be designed as follows: 
(1)  A total of 45 percent of the street length within a subdivision shall be curvilinear. For the purposes of this ordinance, curvilinear shall mean: 
(a)  Streets with a centerline radius between 200 feet and 1,200 feet with lengths as follows: 

(b)  Minor collector streets shall have a minimum radius of 500 feet. 
(c)  Deltas and lengths for compound curves that meet the above radius requirements may be added to give a value for a single curve. 
(d)  A tangent section of less than 200 feet may be included between curves that meet the above radius requirements. 
(e)  Cul de sacs less than 600 feet in length are considered curvilinear. 
(f)  Cul de sacs may not count as more than half (1/2 of 45 percent = 22.5 percent of total street length) of the curvilinear requirement. If a cul de sac exceeds 600 feet in length, only 600 feet will be considered as curved unless it is a curved cul de sac. The cul de sac length within a development may exceed 22.5 percent of the total street length, but the excess length will not count toward the curvilinear requirement. 
(g)  Cul de sacs that meet the above requirements for a curved street may be considered either a cul de sac or a curved street, but not both. 
(2)  The curvilinear calculations will be based on the entire preliminary platted area. Each phase of the development must be at least 20 percent curvilinear unless otherwise approved by the community and economic development director. 
(3)  The maximum length of a straight street segment is 1,200 feet. A straight street segment is any segment of street that does not contain a curve that meets the requirement for a curvilinear street. 
(4)  Only minor collectors with lots having front yards facing them will be considered in the curvilinear requirements. Minor collectors with no lot frontage along them will not be included in the curvilinear calculations. 
c.  Alternatives to curvilinear requirements. The curvilinear design requirements may be waived under the following conditions: 
(1)  The subdivision is part of a planned development which new urbanism is proposed. New urbanism is discussed in the city's comprehensive land use plan. The director of community and economic development will evaluate the street layout to determine if grid pattern streets are appropriate to the land uses within the planned development. 
(2)  In lieu of providing curvilinear streets or a new urbanism design, one or more of the traffic calming measures below shall be incorporated into the design of the street to reduce speeds through neighborhoods and discourage through-traffic intrusions. 
(3)  The curvilinear requirements will not be waived strictly due to cost savings on the part of the developer. In addition to reasons (1) and (2) above, the curvilinear requirements may be waived if the tract being developed is shaped in such a way as to prevent a curvilinear pattern, there are topography issues that make the curvilinear configuration impossible or impractical or there would be significant tree removal in order to achieve a curvilinear layout. 
4.  Traffic calming measures. Local and minor collector streets that connect one major collector or arterial to another major collector or arterial are discouraged. However, when site conditions require this configuration, the street shall incorporate one or more of the following design elements: 
a.  Circuitous through-streets. Through-streets should be designed so that it is not apparent from either end that the street goes through. 

b.  Staggering. Through-streets should be staggered to give the illusion from a distance that a street no longer continues. Staggered streets shall be offset by a minimum of 125 feet from centerline to centerline. 

c.  Traffic roundabouts. Raised circular islands should be placed in an intersection to reduce speeds and discourage cut-through traffic. Traffic islands shall be landscaped with ground cover and street trees. These designs must be approved by the department of community and economic development, the public works department and the fire department. 

5.  Dead end streets. 
a.  Dead end streets shall be permitted only where a future extension or connection is anticipated or planned. In such cases, right-of-way dedication and construction of turnaround facilities will be required, at developer's expense, if the dead end is greater than 150 feet measured from the property line. Any turnaround will be considered temporary until the street is extended or a permanent cul-de-sac is constructed. The turnaround may be constructed without curb and gutter but must meet all other design criteria. The turnaround must be constructed offsite, unless the developer is unable to obtain offsite right-of-way. A written request may be forwarded to the public works director to construct the turnaround within the limits of the development, with the stipulation that funds will be placed in escrow for the removal of the turnaround and associated improvements such as mail boxes and sprinkler systems. 

b.  Provisions shall be made for drainage at the ends of dead end streets. 
c.  When an existing dead end street with temporary turnaround, whether on or offsite, is extended, the developer extending the street shall be responsible for removing the turnaround facilities, constructing the extension or cul-de-sac to the standards in these regulations and restoring the affected area. If funds were placed in escrow for removal expenses, these funds (plus interest) will be provided to the developer extending the street. 
d.  If the developer chooses not to extend a dead end street, then that developer shall provide right-of-way and construct a permanent turnaround. If funds were placed into escrow for the removal of the temporary turnaround, then those funds may be used for the construction of a permanent turnaround. The public works director may waive the requirement for constructing the turnaround facility. In evaluating such request for waiver, the director shall consider such factors as the number of lots on the dead end street, public safety and convenience, as well as other factors. 
B.  Street standards-Horizontal alignment. 
1.  The following minimum centerline radii shall be used in the design of all street construction: 
Type Street Minimum Centerline Radius Arterial 1,000 feet Major collector 800 feet Minor collector 500 feet Local As approved by public works director Cul-de-sacs and Loop streets 50-feet radius to right-of-way line  
2.  Reverse curves shall be separated by a tangent section in accordance with the following table: 
Type Street Minimum Tangent Between Curves Arterial 200 feet Major collector 100 feet Minor collector 50 feet Local As approved by public works director  
3.  Major collector or arterial roadways intersecting other major collector/arterial roadways shall have the following minimum horizontal centerline approach tangent section length as measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street, unless such requirement is waived by the public works director: 
Type Street Intersecting With Minimum Approach 
Tangent Arterial Arterial 200 feet Major Collector Arterial 150 feet Minor Collector Major Collector 100 feet  
Sec. 5.5 - Right-of-way requirements. 
A.  Mid-block and intersection requirements. Mid-block and intersection rights-of-way for streets are required as shown in table 5.5.1. Refer to the design standards manual for intersection layouts. Right-of-way shall be dedicated to facilitate access ramp and/or signal construction as follows: 
1.  Ten-foot x ten-foot clip for local/local street intersections. 
2.  80-foot radius for arterial/arterial intersections and arterial/departure side of major collector street intersections. See design standards manual for layout. 
3.  15 feet x 15 feet clip for all other intersections. 
TABLE 5.5.1 
Required Right-of-Way Widths 

Example: To determine the right-of-way width at the intersection of a principal arterial (7-lane) and a major collector, read down the "SUBJECT STREET CLASSIFICATION" to "Principal Arterial (7-Lane)" and then across the row to the "Intersecting Street Classification" column labeled "Major Collector." The intersection width of the principal arterial is noted in the upper right of the intersection box (120 feet) and the width of the major collector is noted in the lower left of the intersection box (90 feet). 
B.  More than two streets intersecting at a point shall be avoided. No street intersecting an arterial street should vary from a 90 degree angle of intersection by more than five degrees. Streets intersecting collector streets should not vary from a 90 degree angle of intersection by more than ten degrees. All other street intersections should not vary from 90 degrees angle of intersection by more than 15 degrees. 
C.  All streets should be designed to be in line with existing streets. When conditions require the centerlines to be offset, a minimum of 135 feet offset distance is required. Greater centerline offsets may be required when necessary for traffic safety. 
D.  A rural design for a local street includes 30 feet of pavement with no curb and gutter. This standard shall only be used in residential developments with lots greater than one acre. 
E.  Right-of-way shall be dedicated in accordance with the master thoroughfare plan regardless of whether the roadway is being constructed, in whole or in part, with the subdivision. 
F.  Right-of-way for all local streets shall flare to 60 feet at intersections with any arterial street. 
G.  Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall have a 50-foot right-of-way radius. 
H.  Access easements. The minimum width of a private access easement shall be 24 feet. 
I.  TxDOT facilities. The right-of-way width for TxDOT facilities shall be in accordance with TxDOT standards, which may be greater than city standards. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.6 - Other access ways. 
A.  Sidewalks. 
1.  Nonresidential and multifamily uses. The developer shall install sidewalks on all public street frontages within and abutting the development except where the sidewalk will not be a part of an interconnected system, as determined by the public works director. 
2.  Residential uses. Sidewalks shall be constructed on all public street frontages within all urban subdivisions and along all streets that are constructed with curb and gutter. Sidewalks are not required for the local rural standard. The developer may petition for a determination by the public works director that such construction is either not feasible at the time of development for engineering reasons or inappropriate due to the nature of the construction project. 
3.  Connectivity. Sidewalks shall be coordinated with the City of Burleson park plan and the comprehensive land use plan. 
a.  A pedestrian connectivity plan shall be provided with the preliminary plat. The lot layout of the final plat shall reflect this plan. 
b.  The connectivity plan shall designate a pedestrian route through the subdivision that permits linkage to the designated park linkage system. Special street treatment utilizing pavers, stamped concrete and painting shall identify designated crosswalks located on the pedestrian connectivity route. Painting shall not be the primary feature of the designated crosswalks. 
c.  Green space and open space entrances and corridors used for the pedestrian connectivity route shall be at a minimum no less than 30 feet in width. 
4.  Timing of construction. 
a.  Sidewalks that are to be located along property frontage shall be installed at the time a structure is erected on the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the structure until the sidewalk is constructed and approved by the city. Any sidewalks required along the side or the rear of the property shall be constructed at such time as the developer constructs the street. 
b.  Sidewalks across bridges and culverts, sidewalks adjacent to common areas and sidewalks not adjacent to lots shall be constructed with other improvements to the subdivision or development. 
5.  Standards. Sidewalks shall be built in accordance with the design standards manual. 
B.  Walkways. The minimum width of an easement for a public walkway shall be 30 feet. Walkways are typically sidewalks constructed between lots, not adjacent to roadways. Walkways may be required to provide access to schools, parks, playgrounds or nearby roads. 
C.  Bikeways. Bikeways shall be designed and built in accordance with the American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design standards. 
D.  Easements. The developer may, at his own option, choose to provide additional private access easements for sidewalks, walkways, or bikeways. Construction and maintenance of these private access easements will be the responsibility of the developer or subsequent owners. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.7 - Coordination with other roadways. 
A.  State roadways. The developer shall construct curbs, gutters and sidewalks on developments abutting roadways designated as state highways, or right-of-way or land owned by the state. The developer may petition for a determination by the public works director that such construction is either not feasible at the time of development for engineering reasons or inappropriate due to the nature of the construction project. When relieved of the duty to install public improvements within the state right-of-way, the developer shall deposit funds into an escrow account with the city for the future construction of sidewalk along the state roadway. 
B.  Coordination with planned street projects. Where a development will abut an existing street for which construction plans have been prepared for future improvements, the development shall coordinate with the construction plans. If the developer requests an alteration to the construction plans, and the city agrees to such alteration, the developer shall pay to revise the plans as necessary and any increased construction costs. Where the subdivision abuts a future street or existing street proposed for improvement, the engineer must investigate the adjacent conditions and make reasonable accommodation for the future construction. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.8 - Private streets. 
A.  Design and construction requirements. Private street widths, cross-sections and design criteria shall comply with city standards and shall meet the minimum construction standards for public streets. If the development will be gated, it must comply with the gated entry guidelines in the design standards manual. 
B.  Streets excluded. Streets shown on the thoroughfare plan map shall not be used, maintained or constructed as private streets. In addition, the city may deny the creation of any other private street if, in the city's judgment, the private street would have any of the following effects: 
1.  Negatively affect traffic circulation on public streets; 
2.  Impair access to property either onsite or offsite to the subdivision; 
3.  Impair access to or from public facilities including schools, parks and libraries; or 
4.  Delay the response time of emergency vehicles. 
C.  Lot configuration. Lots within a subdivision shall be configured so that the lot lines meet at the centerline of the roadway so that half of the roadway across the lot frontage is contained within the lot. The private street shall be dedicated on the lots as a private access and utility easement. The easement may also need to be dedicated as a public or private drainage easement depending on the site conditions. The plat must include the following note: 
"The streets have not been dedicated to the public, for public access nor have they been accepted by the City of Burleson as public improvements, and the streets and roadways shall be maintained by the property owners association within the subdivision. The private access and utility easement provides unrestricted use and maintenance of the property for utilities. This right extends to all utility providers. The easement also provides the City or County with the right of access for any purpose related to the exercise of a governmental service or function including, but not limited to, fire and police protection, inspection, code enforcement and postal service. The easement permits the City or County to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street that impairs emergency access." 
D.  Cost of private streets. The city shall not pay for any portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street. 
E.  Inspections. Inspections of private streets shall be performed by the city at the developer's cost. The fee shall be set by the city council. 
F.  Community facilities contract required. A community facilities contract (CFC) shall be required for the construction of private streets within a development. The CFC and associated inspections are required because the streets will be used for access by the fire department, police department, public works department and other utility providers. In addition, the private streets and associated drainage facilities are generally a part of the drainage system for the development. 
G.  Maintenance. Developments with private streets shall have a mandatory property owners' association which includes all property served by private streets to ensure maintenance of the private street. 
H.  Waiver of services. The plat, property deeds, and property owner association documents must include the following note: 
"The following public services are not provided within this subdivision: 
 Street maintenance 
 Routine police patrols 
 Enforcement of traffic and parking ordinance 
 Preparation of accident reports 
 Solid waste collection 
 Recycling collection" 
Depending on the characteristics of the proposed development other services may not be provided. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.9 - Street names. 
The developer shall name streets in conformance with the following: 
A.  Proposed street names shall be substantially different in sound and spelling from existing street names in the city, the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction and zip codes used within the city. 
B.  If a new street is a direct or logical extension of an existing street, the existing street name shall be used. 
C.  All proposed street names shall be approved by the director of community and economic development and the public works director. 
D.  Street names shall be no more than 14 characters including spaces, excluding the suffix. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 5.10 - Streetlights. 
A.  If the developer is responsible for constructing arterials or major collectors for access, the developer shall also be responsible for installation of street lights on those roadways. 
B.  Street lights along internal local streets and minor collectors and their intersections with perimeter roadways are considered to be site-related facilities. The developer shall be responsible for 100 percent of the installation costs of such street lights on public streets. 
C.  The developer will request installation of street lights from the applicable utility company prior to the completion of the community facilities. The city will execute a contract with the applicable utility company and the developer. Any extra or specially designed street lighting will be by contract between the developer and the applicable utility company with written approval by the city. Street lighting installation must be complete prior to the issuance of any certificates of occupancy in nonresidential developments or final building inspection approval for residential developments. 
D.  All streetlights installed in connection with any development project shall remain the property of the applicable electric utility company. 
E.  The city agrees to pay for electricity used by streetlights in the city in agreement with the current street-lighting rate schedule approved by the city council and the applicable electric utility company. 
F.  For subdivisions with private streets or subdivisions in the ETJ, the homeowner's association will be responsible for the cost of electricity for the streetlights. 
G.  The developer shall furnish and dedicate all easements required for the installation of transformers, guys, and wiring for streetlights. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
ARTICLE 6. - DRAINAGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 6.1 - Drainage and stormwater management policies. 
A.  Adequate facilities. Where it is anticipated that runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will exceed the capacity of an existing downstream drainage feature and result in hazardous conditions, the commission or city council may deny approval of the plat if plans for mitigation have not been accepted by the city. Mitigation plans shall be provided which include, but are not limited to, all necessary onsite and offsite improvements including storage, storm sewer systems, channel modifications, driveway adjustments, and culvert improvements. The mitigation construction shall be completed prior to the issuance of building permits. The city may accept the phasing of development. 
B.  Developer responsibility. The developer shall be responsible for all storm drainage flowing to, through, and from the property. This responsibility includes the drainage directed to that property by prior development as well as drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography. The developer shall pay for the cost of all onsite and offsite drainage improvements, features to mitigate negative effects on water quality, and the dedication of necessary drainage easements. 
C.  Easements. Drainage easements shall be dedicated for public drainage features in accordance with requirements of section 4.7 of this ordinance. Drainage easements and features shall be included as a portion of buildable (habitable structure) lot(s) and not as a lot by itself unless specifically authorized by the public works director. If a large development related feature is authorized on a separate lot, a property owner's association is required. 
Generally, public drainage features cross property lines, collect runoff from adjacent properties or are located in public street rights-of-way. Drainage features that do not meet these criteria may be considered private and maintained by the owner. Private drainage easements shall be dedicated on the plat for all private drainage features. 
D.  Stormwater quality. Designs for new development shall manage stormwater in a manner that protects water quality by addressing the development's potential to cause erosion, pollution, siltation, and sedimentation in the MS4 and natural creeks. The goal is to maintain after development, to the maximum extent practicable, the predevelopment characteristics in the natural creek that ultimately receives stormwater runoff from the development. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that designs for new development meet the stormwater management requirements in the general permit for stormwater discharges from construction activities issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and its successor agencies. This permit includes the requirement for measures that will be installed during construction to control pollutants in stormwater discharges after construction operations have been completed. 
E.  Stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated anticipating a fully developed watershed. The comprehensive plan, existing land use, and zoning maps shall be used to determine fully developed conditions. The public works director reserves the right to review the determination of fully developed conditions and may require revisions. 
F.  Conveyance of development runoff. Where drainage features such as storm drainage systems, ditches, channels, and natural creeks are reasonably available to receive runoff, the runoff for the design frequency storm shall be collected onsite and conveyed in a storm sewer system to the existing feature. 
G.  Positive overflow. Positive overflow means that flow greater than the design frequency storm will be conveyed by a secondary drainage feature without flooding structures. Streets are designed to carry a specified quantity of stormwater within the right-of-way according to the street classification. At sump locations or slope limitations where the stormwater will leave the right-of-way, a positive overflow path shall be provided. The positive overflow path shall be a concrete flume or other permanent facility authorized by the public works director with a minimum width of four feet. A drainage easement shall be dedicated between lots at or near the low point in the street to allow for positive overflow systems. The public works director may allow alternative designs. 
H.  Minimum finish floor elevations. The public works director may require minimum finish floor elevations (MFF) to provide flood protection on certain lots contained within the subdivision. The MFFs shall be shown on the plat. These elevations shall incorporate the most current floodplain management criteria or other criteria as necessary to avoid damages. The minimum finish floor elevation shall be two feet above the fully developed or three feet above the existing FEMA 100-year water surface elevation where the MFF is associated with a natural creek or open channel. When the MFF is necessitated by situations other than a natural creek or open channel, the MFF shall be set by the developer's engineer and agreed upon by the city. 
The following note or an amended version appropriate to the specific plat shall be added to any plat upon which the director of planning and engineering services requires the establishment of minimum finish floor elevations: 
"The City of Burleson reserves the right to require minimum finish floor elevations on any lot contained within this addition. The minimum elevations shown are based on the most current information available at the time the plat is filed and are subject to change." 
I.  Offsite drainage. 
1.  The developer shall evaluate how the discharge leaving the proposed development will affect downstream structures, features, and property, including but not limited to, flooding, stream channel stability, and water quality. 
2.  When any proposed development requires offsite grading where stormwater runoff has been collected or concentrated, it shall not be permitted to drain onto adjacent property except in existing creeks, channels, storm sewers or streets unless one of the following is provided: 
a.  Notarized letter of permission. The letter shall state that the permission shall bind the owner of the affected property and be a covenant running with the land. It shall also refer to the plans for the improvements creating the need for the permission. The letter shall be filed with the applicable county. 
b.  Drainage easement. A drainage easement shall be dedicated for creeks, ditches, or drainage channels and shall be of a width sufficient to comply with the criteria outlined in these subdivision and development ordinance. 
3.  In the event the developer cannot obtain a notarized letter of permission or a drainage easement, the developer shall provide the city with documentation of all efforts, including evidence of a reasonable offer made to the affected property owner, and one of the following: 
a.  A written request for assistance. The city may pursue acquisition of these easements through negotiations. If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the request may, at the developer's option, be submitted to city council for consideration of acquisition through eminent domain. Any expenses, including staff time, incurred by the city to acquire or attempt to acquire an easement shall be paid by the developer. 
b.  A notarized letter. With the concurrence of the public works director, the developer may execute a notarized letter stating the developer shall save and hold harmless the City of Burleson from any and all claims or suits for damage arising out of concentrations of flow. The letter shall be in a form approved by the city attorney. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 6.2 - Preliminary stormwater management site plan. 
A.  A preliminary stormwater management site plan (SWMSP) shall be prepared for all development that meets the following conditions: 
1.  Disturbs a surface area of 12,000 square feet or more; and 
2.  Creates or adds 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surfaces. 
B.  The preliminary SWMSP shall be prepared in coordination with the preliminary drainage plan on all projects where both are required. The preliminary SWMSP and the preliminary drainage plan may be shown on the same sheet. When a preliminary drainage plan is not required, the preliminary SWMSP shall indicate the existing drainage patterns and runoff coefficients and the proposed changes to these items. 
C.  The preliminary SWMSP must comply with the standards and criteria outlined in this ordinance, the design standards manual, and the stormwater pollution control ordinance. The plan may satisfy the stormwater management portion of the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) that is required for construction activities. However, the SWMSP is not a substitution for the SWPPP. The city's review of the preliminary SWMSP does not constitute acceptance of the final SWMSP or the final development plans. 
D.  The developer shall provide a preliminary SWMSP for the area proposed for development. For amended plats or plats with a previously accepted preliminary SWMSP, the accepted preliminary SWMSP shall be enforced unless a revised preliminary SWMSP is required. 
E.  Three paper copies of the preliminary SWMSP plan shall be submitted with the submittal of a preliminary plat, combination plat, replat, or minor plat for review and acceptance. The plan shall be labeled as "preliminary." Upon acceptance of the plan, the plan shall be signed, sealed, and dated by the engineer, or shall be signed and dated and contain a statement affirming the plan was prepared under the direction of the engineer signing the plan and that the plan is preliminary. 
F.  At a minimum, the SWMSP shall be prepared at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 200 feet and shall include the following: 
1.  Existing and proposed topography as shown by contour lines on two feet vertical intervals. The public works director may require smaller vertical intervals if the shape of the terrain warrants. The datum shall be NAVD88. 
2.  Identification of existing features, such as channels, known historic resources, approximate limits of suspected jurisdictional waters, the approximate limits of tree canopies, and any other features that may affect stormwater quality. 
3.  Design features (best management practices) to mitigate the negative effects of development on stormwater quality and quantity. 
4.  Sufficient documentation and calculations, based on requirements of the design standards manual, to support the number and selection of best management practices. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 6.3 - Preliminary drainage plan. 
A.  This plan shall show the watershed affecting the development and how the runoff from the fully-developed watershed will be conveyed to, through, and from the development. It must comply with the standards outlined in this ordinance and the drainage design criteria found in the design standards manual. The preliminary drainage plan is a guide for the detailed drainage design. The review of the preliminary drainage plan does not constitute final drainage plan approval or authorize a variance to this subdivision and development ordinance. 
B.  For any property involved in the development process, a preliminary drainage plan shall be provided, at the developer's expense, for the area proposed for development. For property with a previously accepted preliminary drainage plan, the accepted preliminary drainage plan may be submitted and enforced unless a revised preliminary drainage plan is required by the city due to lot reconfiguration or other conditions created by the new plat. The public works director may waive the requirement for a preliminary drainage plan if the submitted plat is not anticipated to cause any significant change in runoff characteristics from a previously accepted drainage study or for single residential properties where no drainage problems are anticipated. If the applicant requests a waiver in writing, a copy of any previous drainage plan shall be provided. 
C.  Three paper copies of the preliminary drainage plan shall be submitted with the submittal of a preliminary plat, combination plat, replat, or minor plat for review and acceptance. The plan shall be labeled as "preliminary." The plan shall be signed, sealed, and dated by the engineer. 
D.  The preliminary drainage plan shall be prepared at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 200 feet and shall include the following: 
1.  Existing topography as shown by contour lines on two feet vertical intervals. The public works director may require smaller vertical intervals if the shape of the terrain warrants. The datum shall be NAVD88. 
2.  The boundary and size of each drainage area within and contributing to the property being platted shall be shown. The outline of drainage areas shall follow actual drainage features. Consideration shall be given to existing or anticipated features as modified by development. 
3.  The size and type of existing and proposed drainage facilities for both onsite and offsite facilities. 
4.  Proposed contours and flow arrows for each lot shall clearly indicate where and how the flow from drainage areas will be conveyed or intercepted. 
5.  Sufficient design calculations, based on the criteria in the design standards manual, supporting the preliminary sizes and locations of drainage areas, facilities, and easements. 
6.  Existing and proposed drainage and utility easements. 
7.  Location of special flood hazard areas. 
(Ord.  No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 6.4 - Floodplain development requirements. 
A.  Floodway fringe or floodplain. When a natural creek is preserved and has a floodplain designation shown on the effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM), the 100-year floodplain (base flood) boundaries of the FIRM shall be shown on the filed plat. 
B.  Floodway. When a proposed project affects or modifies the floodway as defined in the flood damage prevention ordinance B-432, a report in the form of a CLOMR is required. Approval from FEMA of the CLOMR is required prior to filing a plat containing the floodway area. Upon completion of the infrastructure improvements, a LOMR shall be submitted to FEMA prior to building permits being issued. The LOMR shall be issued by FEMA prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final inspection being made for any building. 
C.  Plat requirements. Prior to filing a plat with the county, sufficient information shall be submitted to and accepted by the public works department to verify the location and size of all drainage easements, minimum finish floor elevations, and design features to be used as best management practices. The drainage easements shall be tied to the property corners of affected lots. 
D.  Final plan requirements. The developer shall provide complete final plans and specifications for the drainage facilities and SWMSP. Criteria for the design of these facilities are found in the design standards manual. When a project will impact one of the city's existing or proposed parks, storm drainage plans shall be coordinated with the parks and recreation department. 
(Ord. No. B-783-08, § 1, 10-23-2008) 
Sec. 6.5 - Stormwater conveyance. 
    The three types of runoff conveyance features are natural creeks, closed systems, and improved open channels. The design standards manual contains specific criteria regarding the design of the drainage features. 
A.  Natural creeks. Natural creeks shall be preserved unless it is determined by the public works director that it is not feasible to leave the creek in its natural state. In order to assist in this determination, the following are required: 
1.  Report. A hydrologic and hydraulic report is required to establish the 100-year water surface profile. The requirements for the report are outlined in the design standards manual. 
2.  Easement. Drainage easements for natural creeks shall be dedicated as follows: 
a.  For single-family, single-family attached, or two-family subdivisions, the FEMA floodplain shall be developed as drainage easement. 
b.  For all developments other than single-family, single-family attached, or two-family, the floodway must be dedicated as drainage easement in accordance with a drainage study prepared by the developer's engineer. 
3.  Erosion protection. Where natural creeks connect to improved systems, permanent transitional materials shall be required. Additionally, in areas along the natural creek where excessive erosion may occur, grade control structures, drop structures, or other structures may be required to stabilize the channel and flowline. 
4.  Maintenance statement. When an easement is dedicated for a natural creek by plat or separate instrument, the dedication statement shall include the following language: 
The City of Burleson is not responsible for the design, construction, operation, maintenance, or use of any natural creek and associated drainage easements, hereinafter referred to as "feature." Developer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City of Burleson, its officers, employees and agents from any direct or indirect loss, damage, liability or expense and attorneys' fees for any negligence whatsoever, arising out of the design, construction, operation, maintenance, condition or use of the "feature," including any non-performance of the foregoing. Developer will require any successor in interest to accept full responsibility and liability for the "feature." All of the above shall be covenants running with the land. It is expressly contemplated that developer shall impose these covenants upon Lot(s) ________ abutting, adjacent or served by the "feature" the full obligation and responsibility of maintaining and operating said "feature." 
5.  Maintenance. The following shall apply to natural creeks. 
a.  The city is not responsible for any maintenance or cleaning of the natural creek. 
b.  The property owner is responsible for maintenance of any modifications and cleaning of the creek. 
B.  Closed systems. Once stormwater is collected or concentrated and is not conveyed in a natural creek, a closed system shall be used when the flow can be carried in a 60-inch diameter pipe or smaller. The closed system shall be connected to an existing system or extended until it reaches an open channel or natural creek. Alternative designs shall be approved by the public works director. 
1.  Easement. Drainage easements shall be dedicated to a minimum width of 15 feet unless otherwise authorized by the public works director. The easement width required may be greater for larger or deeper systems. 
2.  Erosion protection. Where closed systems connect to natural creeks or improved open channels, end sections and/or transitional materials are required for erosion protection. 
3.  Maintenance. The city will maintain only the drainage improvements within the drainage easement within the city. The county will maintain drainage improvements contained within a drainage easement in the ETJ. Any other improvements or maintenance, including driveways or driveway culverts, shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
C.  Improved open channels. An improved open channel may be used when a natural creek is not feasible and flow cannot be carried in a 60-inch pipe. The full bottom width of an improved open channel shall be lined with reinforced concrete except when the public works director approves the use of another type of lining. The minimum width of the channel bottom shall be eight feet. 
1.  Report. A hydrologic and hydraulic report is required to establish the 100-year water surface profile. The requirements for the report are outlined in the design standards manual. 
2.  Easement or drainage right-of-way. A drainage easement or right-of-way containing the improved open channel shall be dedicated. The channel shall contain the runoff from the 100-year storm plus one foot of freeboard and 12 feet on each side of the channel for maintenance. The 100-year storm shall be based on fully developed conditions. Additional easement may be needed at specific locations for access to the channel for maintenance. Easement shall be dedicated when the adjacent property owners will assume maintenance of the channel. Drainage right-of-way shall be dedicated when the maintenance will be performed by the city. 
3.  Erosion prevention. A transition material is required when the channel connects to a natural creek or closed system. The transition downstream of outfalls shall be shaped and/or lined to the point that flow velocities from the outfall and the channel are non erosive. 
4.  Maintenance. The city will maintain the improved open channel.

ARTICLE 8. - PARK AND RECREATION DEVELOPMENT 
    The purpose of the park requirements is to provide recreational areas in the form of city or private parks in conjunction with subdivision development. Each residential development, including multi-family developments, containing four or more residential units shall dedicate a portion of the land and construct facilities, or pay cash in lieu of dedication and construction. 

Sec. 8.1 - Parkland dedication policy. 
A.  Parkland site selection requirements. 
1.  Land proposed for dedication under this policy shall be suitable for parks, linear destination trails and recreational uses, as determined by the director of parks and recreation. 
2.  Park locations shall generally comply with the parks and trails master plan. 
3.  In selecting a site for a park, the director of parks and recreation will avoid an accumulation of non-contiguous parcels of land or an accumulation of land unsuitable for park purposes. 
4.  Park sites will be selected on the basis of obtaining natural, park-like settings, where available, and will consist of diverse topography and open space suitable for the development of recreational facilities. 
5.  Park sites shall be located, whenever possible, contiguous to school sites and other public or nonprofit agency sites in order to make maximum use of common public facilities and grounds. 
6.  Careful consideration shall be given to the need for development of linear parks and trails around natural creeks and wooded areas. When development occurs near a floodway that is designated by either the parks and trails master plan or the director of parks and recreation, the developer is required to construct that portion of the trail that occurs within his/her development. The developer will construct the trail in accordance with park and recreation design criteria. The cost for the trail's development will be borne by the developer and will be credited toward the developer's infrastructure requirement. 
7.  At least 50 percent of the required dedicated parkland should have slopes in the two percent to five percent range and should be well-drained. 
8.  Floodplain and floodway areas, as designated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) should not exceed 75 percent of the total park dedication. 
9.  All parks dedicated in accordance with this ordinance shall have access to public streets, water, sanitary sewer, and drainage systems. 
10.  Parks shall have a minimum accumulation of 150 feet of frontage along a public street. 
B.  Parkland dedication requirements. Except as provided in subsection D below, each residential subdivision, including multi-family subdivisions, shall dedicate one acre of parkland for every 100 residential units, except that dedication of the FIRM floodway shall require two acres of parkland for every 100 residential units. 
1.  When multi-family subdivisions are proposed and the number of units is unknown, the city will assume the number of units based on the allowable density. Should the number of units be less than the assumed number, the dedication requirements will be adjusted accordingly. 
2.  Land proposed for park dedication shall be shown on the preliminary plat and shall be a minimum of three acres in size, unless otherwise approved by the director of parks and recreation. Such park sizes and classifications shall comply with the standards set forth in the parks and trails master plan. 
3.  Land proposed for park dedication should be within the subdivision. However, the city may accept park dedication outside the subdivision if it is of such proximity to the development so as to benefit the development. 
4.  If a replat is filed on a property and the number of units within the subdivision increases, additional park dedication will be required to account for the increase in the number of units. 
5.  Prior to conveyance of property to the city, the city may require the developer to perform a phase 1 environmental assessment. Should the environmental assessment indicate environmental contamination, the city may require additional testing by the developer or may require the developer to locate another site suitable for park dedication. 
6.  The developer shall grant the city access to the property proposed for parkland so that the city can make inspections and surveys prior to conveyance of the property. 
7.  Determinations of required land dedication will be based upon review of preliminary plats. Failure to indicate proposed park dedications on the submitted preliminary plat will be sufficient grounds for the city to deny the preliminary plat. 
C.  Parkland conveyance requirements. Upon final agreement of the location of the park dedication, the developer shall provide the following: 
1.  A metes and bounds description of the land to be conveyed; and 
2.  A survey plat of the park property only; and 
3.  A copy of the developer's deed demonstrating ownership and right to convey the property; and 
4.  Documents conveying ownership to the city in the form of a: 
a.  General warranty deed; or 
b.  Special warranty deed and a title policy provided by the developer insuring the city in an amount equal to the value of the property. 
D.  Fees in lieu of parkland dedication. 
1.  If the calculation for required park dedication results in less than three acres or does not meet the site selection criteria set forth in this ordinance, the director of parks and recreation may require a fee in lieu of dedication or a combination of parkland dedication and fee. 
2.  The fee in lieu of parkland dedication will be adopted by the city council as part of the city's fee schedule and will be "per residential unit" based on the fair market value of residential property in Burleson. The total fee to be paid to the city in lieu of dedication shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The total dedication requirement shall be determined by dividing the number of units contained within the final plat by 100; then 
b.  Subtracting the acreage of any parkland dedication to obtain the net requirement for fee in lieu of dedication; then 
c.  Multiplying the net acreage requirement by 100 to calculate the equivalent number of units; then 
d.  Multiplying the equivalent number of lots times the fee set by city council. 
3.  The fair market value per lot of parkland dedication will be determined by the city through independent appraisals performed by a state certified appraiser with a MAI designation. Should the developer not agree with the city's determination of fair market value, the developer may, at his own cost, obtain an appraisal of the property from a state certified appraiser with a MAI designation. If the property was acquired within the year previous to the platting of the property, the developer may submit the contract for sale for consideration in determining fair market value. The director of parks and recreation shall make the determination of fair market value. 
4.  Fees in lieu of dedication shall be assessed at the time of final plat submittal and shall be paid prior to recording the plat with the county. All fees shall be based upon the dedication requirement and the fee schedule in effect at the time of final plat. 
5.  If parkland dedication for a phase subdivision is proposed in future phases, the developer shall do the following prior to filing of plats that do not contain parkland: 
a.  Deed the parkland or a portion of the parkland located within the future phase in accordance with section 8.1.C above. 
b.  Pay the fee in lieu of parkland dedication with the final plat. The city will reimburse the fee upon receiving the deed for the parkland.

2.  The park infrastructure fee is based upon the cost to purchase and erect minimal park amenities on a three-acre park site. The fee shall be adjusted annually on or about October 1 based on the change in the consumer price index (CPI) for the previous year. In addition, the city council retains the right to adjust the fee in an amount greater than the CPI. 
B.  Park infrastructure construction. 
1.  Upon approval by the director of parks and recreation, a developer may construct park infrastructure in lieu of paying the park infrastructure fee. 
2.  The value of the park infrastructure, including design of the park and the labor to construct the infrastructure, shall be equal to or greater than the park infrastructure fee would have been. In no case will the city reimburse the developer for expenditures greater than the park infrastructure fee would have been. 
3.  Prior to constructing park infrastructure, the developer shall provide to the director of parks and recreation a park plan for improvements that comply with the city's design, specification, and construction standards. The following features will be considered for construction: 
a.  Playground.

(a)  Centerlines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines or rights-of-way lines of streets or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines or rights-of-way. 
(b)  Lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines so as to eliminate a zoning division on any platted lot.

(e)  Extensions of features. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in [subsections] (a) through (d) above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the zoning district map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
(f)  Vacated public way. Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, the zoning district line adjoining each side of the street, alley, or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of the vacated street, alley or way and all area so involved shall be subject to regulations of the extended districts. 
(g)  Variance of physical features and official zoning district map. Where physical features of the ground are at variance with information shown on the official zoning district map or when there arises a question as to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question cannot be resolved by the application of subsections (a) through (f), the property shall be considered as classified in the A, agricultural district in the same manner as provided for newly annexed territory, and the issuance of a building permit and the determination of zoning shall be in accordance with the provisions provided in section 5, zoning annexed territory.

A courtesy notice shall also be provided to real property owners within an additional 100 feet of the property. These properties will not be included in the protest calculation, as regulated by 6-105(f) below. The notice shall be given not less than ten days before the date set for hearing by posting such notice properly addressed and postage paid to each owner as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll.

(f)  The city council may, by resolution, elect to combine the planning and zoning commission hearing and the council hearing; however, the city council shall not take action upon any proposed amendment or change until it has received the final report and recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. When the joint hearing provision of this ordinance is in effect, the city council shall cause a notice showing the time and place of the hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. In addition, notice of all jointly held public hearings on proposed changes in classification shall be sent to owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the property on which the change in classification is proposed, the notice to be given not less than ten days before the date set for hearing, to all the property owners as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll.

(h)  The city may, at its option, establish additional rules and procedures for public notification of proposed zoning changes and development proposals (e.g., site plans, plats, etc.) which may include, but not be limited to, the posting of a sign(s) on any property that is proposed for a zoning change or development by the applicant or its agent(s). Knowledge of and adherence to such rules and procedures, if so established by the city, shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

All actions to discontinue a nonconforming use of land or structure shall be taken with due regard to the property rights of the persons affected when considered in the light of the public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the designated nonconforming use and the conservation and preservation of the property.

It is the intent of this ordinance to permit such nonconforming use to continue, under regulations herein contained, until the same are removed, but not to encourage their survival. 
(b)  It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved. 
19-105. Nonconforming uses regulated. Except as herein provided, no nonconforming use of land or buildings nor any nonconforming structure shall be enlarged, changed, altered or repaired in conformity with the regulations contained in this article. 
19-110. Nonconforming status. Any use, lot or structure which does not conform with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, is nonconforming when: 
(a)  The use, lot or structure was in existence and lawfully operating on June 27, 1985, and has since been in regular and continuous use; or 
(b)  The use, lot or structure is lawful at the time of the adoption of any amendment to this ordinance but because of the amendment no longer complies with applicable regulations; or 
(c)  The use, lot or structure was in existence at the time of annexation to the city and has since been in regular and continuous use. 
19-115. Continuing lawful use of property. 
(a)  It is the policy of the City of Burleson to allow the continuance of legal non-conforming uses but not to encourage their survival. It is in the long-term best interest of the community for all properties and structures to ultimately come into compliance with the requirements of the municipal zoning ordinance. The ordinance, as adopted, is intended to implement the goals and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan and, therefore, all properties should ultimately be brought into compliance with the requirements of the municipal zoning ordinance. 
(1)  If, at the effective date of this section or amendment thereof, a lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
a.  The legal non-conforming use does not cease due to discontinuance or abandonment. 
b.  The legal non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section, unless provided for herein; or 
c.  The legal non-conforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any portion of the same lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section. 
(2)  For the purpose of this section, "abandonment" shall be defined as intent by the owner to permanently close or cease the use, coupled with any act or statement by the owner that manifests such intent. The following conditions, events or conduct shall be presumed to constitute intent to abandon a legal non-conforming use: 
a.  The closure or cessation of the non-conforming use for a period of 120 consecutive days; or 
b.  The failure of the owner to repair the structure or property used to operate the non-conforming use within 30 days after the chief building official or code enforcement officer has given the owner written notice that the building, structure or property is: 
1.  In an advanced stage or dilapidation, as determined by either the zoning administrator or the chief building official; 
2.  In violation of one or more applicable health and safety codes adopted by the city that govern the use or condition of structures designed for human occupancy, as amended, including but not limited to the applicable building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and life safety codes as adopted by the city; or 
3.  Otherwise unsafe for the continuation of the current use or occupancy. 
(3)  For the purpose of this section, "discontinuance" shall be defined as follows: 
a.  When a legal non-conforming use has historically been operated on a continuous basis, a closure or cessation or a use for a period of 180 consecutive days, irrespective of whether the owner has actual intent to abandon the use; or 
b.  When a legal non-conforming use has historically been operated only on a seasonal basis, such use shall be deemed to have been discontinued, regardless of whether the owner has actual intent to abandon the use, if either: 
1.  The structure or property upon or in which the use has been operated is closed or the non-conforming use ceases to operate for a period of 180 consecutive days; or 
2.  The structure or property upon or in which the use has been operated is closed or the non-conforming use ceases to operate in a bona-fide manner during one or more normal and customary seasons or periods of operation during which the non-conforming use has historically been operated. 
(Ord. No. CSO#111-01-2015 , § 1, 1-5-2015) 
19-120. Changing nonconforming uses. 
(a)  A nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restrictive classification, after approval by the board of adjustment, provided that when a nonconforming use is changed to a nonconforming use of a higher or more restrictive classification, it shall not later be reverted to the former less restrictive classification. 
(b)  No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use which requires more off-street parking spaces or off-street loading space than the original nonconforming use, unless additional off-street parking and loading space is provided so as to comply with the requirements of sections 5, zoning annexed territory and section 14, compliance required. 
19-125. Extension of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout the building provided: 
(a)  No structural alterations may be made on or in the building, except those required by law to preserve the building in a structurally sound condition. 
(b)  The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling units or rooms existing at the time the use became a nonconforming use. 
(c)  No nonconforming use within a building may be extended to occupy any land outside the building. 
(d)  No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the land became a nonconforming use. 
19-130. Restoration of damaged property. A building damaged to the extent of not more than 50 percent of its reasonable value, by fire, explosion, or other casualty, act of God, or a public enemy, may be restored and the occupancy or use continued to the extent the building or use existed at the time of the damage. 
19-135. Termination of nonconforming uses. The right to operate a nonconforming use shall cease and the use shall be terminated under any of the following circumstances: 
(a)  The use is abandoned or discontinued. 
(b)  If any provision of this ordinance, other ordinance, federal, or state law is violated with respect to a nonconforming use. 
(c)  When a nonconforming use is brought into compliance by rezoning. 
(d)  The structure in which a nonconforming use is housed, operated or maintained is damaged to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value. 
(e)  When the right to maintain or operate a nonconforming use has been terminated by the board of adjustment as provided in section 11, board of adjustment hereof. 
19-140. Registration of nonconforming uses. The operator, owner or occupant of a nonconforming use, lot, or building shall, within 18 months after the date on which use, lot, or building becomes nonconforming, register the nonconforming use, lot or building by obtaining from the building official a certificate of occupancy (nonconforming) even though a previous certificate of occupancy may have been issued. The certificate of occupancy (nonconforming) shall be considered as evidence of the legal existence of a nonconforming use as contrasted to an illegal use or violation of this ordinance. The building official shall maintain a register of all certificates of occupancy issued for nonconforming uses and shall, on written request and payment of a fee, issue a duplicate certificate to anyone having a proprietary interest, in the property in question. A nonconforming structure need not be registered. 
19-145. Rules of procedure for the processing of requests for discontinuance or amortization of legal non-conforming uses. 
(a)  Determination of need for expedited compliance. As noted in [section] 19-115 of the municipal zoning ordinance, it is the policy of the City of Burleson to allow the continuance of legal non-conforming uses but not to encourage their survival. A legal non-conforming use shall be permitted to continue for the life of the structure based upon the investment made by the original builder or operator. No structural alterations that extend the life or expand the degree of non-compliance shall be permitted as a general rule. Under certain conditions the continued existence of a legal non-conforming use may create such a degree of incompatibility with surrounding land uses and with the intent of the city's short range, medium range and long range comprehensive planning that a requirement for expedited compliance with the zoning district regulations is necessary in the public interest. A decision of this nature may affect vested property rights of the property owner and, therefore, the following procedural requirements shall apply. 
(1)  Determination of need for expedited compliance. Any city officer, board, commission or the city council may request that the zoning board of adjustment establish a zoning compliance date for a non-conforming use. Upon receiving such a request, the board shall determine whether there is a public necessity for expedited compliance with the zoning regulations. The following factors must be considered by the board in determining the public necessity for expedited compliance: 
a.  The character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
b.  The degree of incompatibility of the use to the zoning district in which it is located. 
c.  The effect of the non-conforming use on the surrounding area and the effect of its cessation on that area. 
If a request for the establishment of a compliance date is received by the zoning board of adjustment, the board will schedule a public hearing in conformance with the notice and procedural requirements established by Section 11 of Ordinance No. B-582 and the rules of the board. 
(2)  Hearing requirements. Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the owner of the affected property and all surrounding property owners within 200 feet of the subject property as prescribed for other cases heard by the zoning board of adjustment. All interested citizens, individuals and organizations will be given the opportunity to appear before the board and present evidence that they deem relevant and appropriate for the board to consider in determining the need for the establishment of a compliance date for the specific non-conforming use. 
At the conclusion of the public hearing the board shall make a finding as to whether or not there is a need for expedited compliance with the municipal zoning ordinance and shall determine whether or not it is appropriate to set a date certain for the use or activity to come into compliance with the current requirements of the ordinance. If the board determines that there is no need for expedited compliance, it shall provide written notice to the party who requested the hearing that the board has found that expedited compliance is not necessary at the present time. No further action shall be taken by the board and the non-conforming use shall retain its existing status. Any party who disagrees with this determination by the board shall have the right to appeal such decision to state district court in the same manner as any other decision of the board may be presented for judicial review. Review is by writ of certiorari and shall be presented in the manner set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.011. 
(b)  Expedited compliance-procedure for determining amortization value. If the board determines that expedited compliance is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, it shall commence the proceedings necessary to establish the value of the non-conforming use and a reasonable amortization period for that use. The board of adjustment shall initially establish a time for hearing evidence on the various value and income issues necessary to comply with the amortization process. The board shall give the various parties to an amortization case sufficient time to conduct discovery and to prepare evidence of value, depreciation and income. The standard position of the board shall be to establish a hearing date a minimum of 60 days following the determination of a need for expedited compliance. The parties may exchange written discovery requests and take, as appropriate, depositions of potential witnesses. Discovery disputes will be presented to the chairman of the board for resolution. The hearing to determine value and income matters relating to amortization shall be subject to the same notice requirements as those established for the expedited compliance hearing. The purpose of the second hearing shall be to determine the value of the interest taken, if any, and whether the owner has had a reasonable opportunity to recoup that value. The value is determined in the following manner: 
(1)  A determination is made, based on the presentment of evidence, of the initial investment made by the original owner in the construction and establishment of the non-conforming use. Land value is not a factor as the property owner or his successor will retain ownership and the right to use the land for a legal use. The board should consider any evidence establishing the amount of the investment made in the establishment of the non-conforming use prior to the point in time at which it became legal non-conforming. Any improvement, addition, expansion or change made after the date of its legal non-conformity shall not be considered by the board, as it was made by the owner with knowledge of the limited life expectancy and use of the property. Initial investment value shall not be given to items that may be transported to a new site. Compensation for these items is addressed as a relocation cost under subsection (b)(7). The purpose of amortization value determination is to fully recognize the investment the owner made at the time that the use was legally permitted. 
(2)  The board next determines the date upon which the non-conforming use came into existence and/or operation. 
(3)  The board shall then determine the income that the property has produced annually since the non-conforming use commenced. The board, at its discretion, may make findings as to the annual operating cost of the non-conforming use to determine income over purely operating revenue. The board shall prepare a written finding stating clearly for each year that the non-conforming use has been in existence, the annual income it has produced and shall further make a finding of its current annual income based upon the income it produced at the close of the most recent calendar year for which it has been in operation. If due to the age of the non-conforming use, changes of ownership, or the loss or destruction of records it is not possible to prepare an income finding for each year of the non-conforming use the board will make a finding for each year that can be documented and will note why the missing years have not been addressed. The board shall use that annual income as the current and future income projection of the non-conforming use for determining amortization of any remaining investment value. Any party to these proceedings shall have the right to offer evidence as to why that projection is no longer realistic based upon evidence of economic change. 
(4)  The board shall determine whether the original investment in the non-conforming use is subject to depreciation due to physical and/or market conditions. The board shall look at standard industry practices in determining a reasonable depreciation schedule. 
(5)  The board shall then take the original investment value determined in step number (1) of this process and then subtract from that number the income of the non-conforming use as determined in step (3) and any depreciation of the non-conforming use as determined in step (4). If the subtraction of the income of the non-conforming use from the original investment value less depreciation leaves a positive figure of value remaining in the tract, the board shall make a determination that there is unamortized value in the non-conforming use that must be addressed by the city prior to expedited compliance. If the subtraction of the income streams from the initial investment value produces a negative number, then no unamortized value will remain and the city may proceed with establishing a date for expedited compliance without the need to address unamortized value. 
(6)  All findings of the board pertaining to the value of the investment in the non-conforming use and the rate of return derived by the owner must be reasonable and in accordance with accepted industry practices for that type of non-conforming use. Any party may offer evidence to the board in order to substantiate a reasonable value of the initial investment and/or a reasonable rate of return for such non-conforming use. 
(7)  The board shall next determine whether the property owner will incur any costs of closing down or relocating the non-conforming use occurring on the tract. Closure or relocation cost shall include only the reasonable and necessary expenses to transport items and material on the site to a new location. Relocation cost does not include the cost of acquiring alternate land as the property owner is retaining the land at the existing site to convert to a conforming use. The cost of relocation does not include the cost of removing permanent improvements such as buildings, parking areas, or public works facilities that will remain on the original site for use by the owner in a conforming business activity. 
(c)  Board findings on unamortized value and the cost of relocation. If the board has made a determination that unamortized value remains in the non-conforming use by determining that the original investment value minus depreciation exceeds the amount of income derived from the non-conforming use during its operation through the date of the amortization hearing, the board shall make the following findings as a matter of record: 
(1)  The dollar value of the unamortized interest remaining in the non-conforming use (original investment value, minus depreciation and minus income earned during historic operation of the non-conforming use). 
(2)  The dollar income the non-conforming use produced during its last full calendar year of operation prior to the date of the hearing. 
(3)  The dollar cost of relocating business assets on inventory under (b)(7) above. 
(4)  The calendar date upon which amortization shall be complete which shall be determined by dividing the unamortized value from step (1) by the current annual income of the non-conforming use set forth in (2) above. The board shall then add the closure and relocation costs identified in (b)(7) to determine the investment or cost to be amortized. The calendar date determined herein shall be the date upon which the income from the non-conforming use is believed to have fully amortized the original investment value of the non-conforming use together with the closure/relocation costs that are properly chargeable to the non-conforming use. 
    The board shall make these findings matters of record in the minutes of the board meeting in which such final determination was reached. The date upon which final amortization occurs (findings (4) as set forth above) shall be the date upon which the legal non-conforming use shall cease to operate in a non-conforming status. 
    Under no circumstance shall a non-conforming use be given less than 90 days to cease operation irrespective of the date determinations made above. The 90-day minimum is to provide the non-conforming use business with the opportunity to give its customers, suppliers and vendors proper notice and to permit an orderly closure and transfer of business operations. 
    The zoning board of adjustment shall cause its findings to be transmitted to the city council if any unamortized value remains in the non-conforming use identified for expedited compliance. The city council in its sole discretion shall have the right to determine if the city should appropriate funds to purchase the remaining unamortized value of the non-conforming use, thereby instituting immediate closure rather than waiting for the expiration of the time necessary for the automatic amortization of remaining value.

Sections 80-84. - Reserved. 
Section 85. - PD, planned development district. 
85-100. Purpose. The PD, planned development district is established to provide for greater flexibility and discretion in the application of a variety of land uses and more effective mitigation of potentially adverse impacts on adjacent land than is possible under conventional district regulations. It is recognized that it is desirable for certain improved sites within the city to be redeveloped and for other unimproved sites to be developed in a manner compatible with adjacent improved land in accordance with development plans prepared and approved as a part of the ordinance authorizing the zoning necessary for the proposed development. Improvements and uses in a PD district are subject to conformance with an ordinance and development plan approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. 
85-105. Use regulations. The permitted use or uses of property located in the PD district shall be determined at the time the district is approved. A PD district may include a combination of different dwelling types and/or a variety of residential and nonresidential land uses which creatively complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. 
85-110. Approval procedures. 
(a)  The procedures for approval of a request for a zoning change to PD shall be the same as for a requested change to any other zoning classification as set forth in section [6], amendments of this ordinance. 
(b)  The application for PD zoning shall be accompanied by a development plan meeting the requirements of this section. 
(c)  No application for PD zoning shall be accepted unless accompanied by a development plan and the appropriate filing fee. 
(d)  Minor changes to an approved development plan, which will not cause any of the following circumstances to occur, may be authorized by the city manager or the city manager's designee: 
(1)  A five percent or greater increase in the gross floor areas of structures. 
(2)  Any substantial and material changes in such external effects on adjacent property as noise, heat, light, glare and vibration. 
(3)  A substantial and material reduction in the originally approved separations between buildings. 
(4)  Any adverse changes in traffic circulation, safety, drainage and utilities. 
(5)  A five percent or greater increase in the height of structures. 
(6)  A ten percent or greater reduction in the originally approved setbacks from property lines. 
(7)  A five percent or greater increase in ground coverage by structures. 
(8)  A five percent or greater reduction in the ratio of off-street parking and loading space. 
(9)  A change in the size, height, lighting, flashing, animation or orientation of originally approved signs. 
(f)  The city manager or the city manager's designee shall determine whether changes being requested, this determination may be appealed by the applicant to the zoning board of adjustment. Any change deemed not to be a minor change, as indicated above, shall be processed as a new application in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
85-115. Considerations for PD zoning and development plan approval. During the review and evaluation process for PD zoning and development plan approval, the following criteria shall be considered: 
(a)  The nature and character of the development and adequacy of the buffer between proposed improvements on the site and adjacent property. 
(b)  The adequacy of utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary supporting facilities that have been or will be provided. 
(c)  The adequacy of the design, location and arrangement of all driveways and parking spaces so as to provide for the safe and convenient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic without adversely affecting the general public or adjacent developments. 
(d)  The adequacy of any nuisance prevention measures that have been or will be taken to prevent or control offensive odor, fumes, dust, noise and vibration. 
(e)  The effect directional lighting will have on neighboring properties. 
(f)  The impact of the proposed development on adjacent property values and on the ability of the adjacent property to be developed. 
In approving a development plan, the planning and zoning commission or city council may impose additional reasonable requirements necessary to protect the public interest and welfare of the community. 
85-125. Development plan approval requirements. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued and no use of land, buildings or structures shall be made in the PD district until the same has been approved by the city council as part of a development plan in compliance with the procedures, terms and conditions of this section. 
85-130. Development plan requirements. The development plan submitted in support of a request for development plan approval shall contain sufficient information delineating the characteristics of the site, changes in those characteristics as may be proposed by the development, how the development will relate to public services and facilities, and what protection features are included to ensure that the development will be compatible with existing and allowable development on adjacent property. As much of this information as possible should be contained on a single plan; however, it may be desirable to provide some of the information on separate plans for purposes of clarity. The development plan shall show at least the following items of information: 
(a)  A scale drawing of proposed public or private streets and alleys; building sites or building lots; areas proposed for dedication or reserved as parks, parkways, playgrounds, utility and garbage easements, school sites, street widening, street changes; the points of ingress and egress from existing public streets on an accurate survey of the boundary of the tract; and topography with a contour interval of not less than five feet, or spot grades where the relief is limited. 
(b)  Where multiple types of land use are proposed, a land use indications delineating the specific areas to be devoted to various uses. 
(c)  Where building complexes are proposed, a showing of the location of each building and the minimum distance between buildings, and between buildings and the property line, street line and/or alley line. For buildings more than one story in height, except for single-family and two-family residences, elevations and/or perspective drawings may be required in order that the relationship of the building to adjacent property, open spaces and to other features of the development plan may be determined. Such drawings need only indicate the height, number of floors and exposure for access, light and air. 
(d)  The arrangement and provision of off-street parking and off-street loading where required. Any special traffic regulation facilities proposed or required to ensure the safe function of the circulation plan. 
(e)  A designation of the maximum building coverage of the site. 
(f)  Location of screening and landscaping where such treatment is essential to the proper arrangement of the development in relation to adjacent property. The plan shall, when required, include screening walls, ornamental planting, playgrounds, wooded areas to be retained, lawns and gardens if such are determined to be necessary by the city council. 
85-135. Development schedule. A schedule of development shall be submitted with the development plan. Estimated phasing of the development defining construction start and finish dates shall be provided. The applicant shall provide a status report annually stating the status of development to the community development director or his/her designee for review by the development assistance committee. Proposed revisions to the development schedule may be submitted at the time of the annual report. If it is determined that significant revisions are proposed, the development assistance committee may submit the development schedule to the planning and zoning commission and city council for consideration and appropriate action. Failure to submit a report may be considered violation of the condition of the planned development. 
85-140. Site plan requirements. A site plan, as defined and regulated by section 131-125, site plan regulations, shall accompany any application for building permit. Said site plan shall be consistent with the general provisions of the approved development plan and will be reviewed by the development assistance committee and approved by the city council upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. 
85-145. Design standards and regulations relating to construction in the planned development district. Planned development zoning district ordinances and related development plans generally divide planned development areas into general use categories. The city council intends the specific design standards in chapters 10, 11, 36, 63, 86 and appendices A-C to control the actual construction and development of the individual land uses unless it should expressly change or alter those development standards for a category of use or a specific facility within a planned development district. The city council approves each planned development zoning district subject to the design standards and regulations identified above as existing and adopted on the date an actual construction permit is requested. Any area of a planned development district approved for single family residential detached development shall develop under the design standards and regulations identified above as they existed when the first construction permit for a single-family residence was requested for a home in that planned development district. 
(Ord. No. CSO#722-10-2017 , § 2, 10-16-2017) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. CSO#722-10-2017 , § 1, adopted Oct. 16, 2017, repealed the former § 85-145, and enacted a new § 85-145 as set out herein. The former § 85-145 pertained to landscaping, screening, parking, and area regulations, and derived from original codification. 
85-150. Approval. Every planned development district approved under the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered as an amendment to the ordinance as applicable to the property involved. In approving the planned development district, the city council may impose conditions relative to the standard of development, and such conditions shall be complied with before a certificate of occupancy is issued for the use of the land or any structure which is part of the planned development district; and such conditions shall not be construed as conditions precedent to the approval of the zoning amendment, but shall be construed as conditions precedent to the granting of a certificate of occupancy. 
85-155. Violations. The violation of any condition or requirement on an approved development plan or any construction or use that is not in compliance with an approved site plan shall be deemed to be a violation of the ordinance which granted the PD zoning change subject to development plan approval.

Section 101. - IH35 overlay district. 
101-1 Purpose. The IH35, Interstate Highway 35 overlay district, is established to encourage the development and redevelopment of the IH35 Corridor by providing for the flexibility of uses, stimulating a broad mix of commercial development, incorporating appropriate residential uses, supporting and sustaining property values of properties within the overlay district as well as those adjacent to it, and creating a quality and unique gateway for Burleson along the IH35 Corridor. This overlay district establishes a set of urban design and development standards for development of properties within the overlay district. It also will enable Burleson to proactively anticipate and coordinate with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) all current, anticipated and new improvements to IH35 so that the city may best leverage development opportunities along the IH35 Corridor. The standards of the IH35 overlay district shall supersede the regulations of the underlying zoning districts as well as the subdivision and design standards to the extent the overlay standards conflict with those standards. 
101-2. District limits and character. The IH35 overlay district is comprised of a defined area. Within this area are five specific plan areas that contain additional regulations delineated herein. The limits of these areas are as follows: 
(a)  The limits of the IH35 overlay district shall be shown on the zoning district map, as amended, of the city, and shall generally comprise a boundary extending 500 feet on both sides from the right-of-way of Interstate Highway 35 unless included within a specific plan area. All parcels contained along the Interstate Highway 35 corridor within the city limits between County Road 530B and the southernmost city limit line will also be considered within this corridor. Property currently located in the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the City of Burleson shall be subject to the conditions of the overlay district upon annexation into the city limits. 
(b)  The limits of IH35 specific plan 1 shall also be shown on the zoning district map for the city as amended. The development character of specific plan 1 shall be predominantly a corporate and hospitality mixed-use environment in order to take advantage of its location near Spinks Airport as a regional hub for transportation and business. 
(c)  The limits of IH35 specific plan 2 shall also be shown on the zoning district map for the city as amended. The development character of specific plan 2 shall be principally a nonresidential area providing areas for commercial, office, educational and institutional development, with limited areas for industrial and higher density residential projects. 
(d)  The limits of IH35 specific plan 3 shall also be shown on the zoning district map for the city as amended. The development character of specific plan 3 shall be a mixed-use place providing civic, convention, hospitality, entertainment, retail, mixed residential and other lifestyle destinations. 
(e)  The limits of IH35 specific plan 4 shall also be shown on the zoning district map for the city as amended. The development character of specific plan 4 shall be a business park in order to take advantage of its location on Interstate Highway 35 so that a mix of businesses, light industrial facilities, warehouses and showrooms can be provided in a flex-space environment with good access from all parts of the region. 
(f)  The limits of IH35 specific plan 5 shall also be shown on the zoning district map for the city as amended.

ARTICLE V. - SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 

Section 130. - Specific use permits. 
130-100. Purpose. Certain uses, because of the characteristics of the use, may be appropriate in some zoning districts under certain conditions in addition to the zoning districts in which they are a permitted use. These uses are identified in article 3, zoning districts. Each use that may be considered for a specific use permit is listed in the district in which it is permitted with the conditions that must be met for approval. The procedure and criteria for approval of a specific use permit are set forth in section 130-105, generally, below. 
130-105. Generally. 
(a)  The city council may authorize specific use permits in the same manner as other amendments to the zoning ordinance. 
(b)  Application for a specific use permit may be made by any property owner or other person having a proprietary interest in the property for which a specific use permit is requested by filing an application on the forms provided by the city and paying the established fee. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan drawn to scale and showing the elements indicated in section 131, site plan requirements, when required by conditions of the specific use permit. The site plan shall be considered and filed as part of the ordinance, and if approved, filed prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(c)  Every specific use permit granted shall be considered an amendment to the zoning ordinance as applicable to the property affected but shall not be considered as a permanent change in zoning. If the building, premises, or land used under the specific use permit is voluntarily vacated for a period of six months or more, or if the building, premises, or land is more than 50 percent destroyed by fire or other cause, the use of the property shall, conform to the regulations of the original zoning district unless a new specific use permit is granted for continuation of the use. 
(d)  In granting a specific use permit, the city council may impose such conditions as are deemed to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, safety, or general welfare. These conditions shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the building official for use of the property pursuant to the specific use permit. 
(e)  A specific use permit may be granted for specific periods of time after which the planning and zoning commission may inquire into the continuation of the permit and, based upon its findings, recommend its discontinuance or an extension of the time period as set forth in the ordinance establishing the specific use permit. 
(f)  No specific use permit shall be granted unless the applicant, owner, and grantee of the specific use permit are willing to accept and agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements of the specific use permit. 
(g)  A building permit, if required, shall be applied for and secured within one year from the time of granting the specific use permit; provided, however, [that] the city council may authorize an extension of this time upon request by the permit holder and recommendations by the planning and zoning commission. Failure of a building permit to be issued within one year or within any other time frame authorized by the city council shall render the specific use permit void. 
(h)  No building, premises, or land used under a specific use permit may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed unless a separate specific use permit is granted for such enlargement, modification, structural alteration, or change. 
(i)  The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to the granting, extension, revocation, modification or any other action taken relating to such specific use permit. 
(j)  All specific use permits approved in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall be referenced on the official zoning map, and a list of such permits shall be maintained by the city manager or their designee. 
130-110. Factors to be considered. In granting or denying an application for a specific use permit, the city council shall take into consideration the following factors: 
(a)  Safety of the motoring public and of pedestrians using the facility and the area immediately surrounding the site. 
(b)  Safety from fire hazard, and measures for fire control. 
(c)  Protection of adjacent property from flood or water damage. 
(d)  Noise producing elements; and glare of vehicular and stationary lights and effect of such lights on established character of the neighborhood. 
(e)  Location, lighting and type of signs; and relation of signs to traffic control and adverse effect on adjacent properties. 
(f)  Street size and adequacy of pavement width for traffic and reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use around the site and in the immediate neighborhood. 
(g)  Adequacy of parking, as determined by requirements of this ordinance for off-street parking facilities for similar uses, location of ingress and egress points for parking and off-street loading spaces; and protection of the public health by all weather surfacing on all parking areas to control dust. 
(h)  Such other measures as will secure and protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. 
Section 131. - Site plan requirements. 
131-105. Site plan requirements generally. Whenever a site plan is required by this ordinance, such site plan must conform to the requirements of this section. Except as otherwise provided herein, all site plans must be approved by the city council upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. The site plan submitted in support of an application (form provided by the building official) shall satisfy the requirements for site plan submittals as set forth by the development assistance committee. Site plans shall be reviewed by the development assistance committee at the next scheduled meeting after submittal.

Editor's note- Ord. No. B-792-10(B0114) , § 1(Exh. A), adopted Jan. 21, 2014, amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Art. IV, §§ 4-1-4-3, 4-45, 4-46, 4-60-4-63, 4-90-4-95, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. B-792-10, adopted March 15, 2010. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 4-1. - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The policy and design standards established by this article regard the public realm as the most important space within the development and therefore place the greatest emphasis and control on property within, and fronting on, the public realm. The purpose of this emphasis is to create a community asset that is pleasant to see, enjoyable to inhabit and will encourage community activities. 
B.  The plan for the Old Town Overlay District includes a network of streetscapes, public spaces, buildings, and site amenities that are based on historically similar small town downtowns. Each component contributes to the traditional, regional elements appropriate to this location and climate. While each building and site should have its own distinct design, each building or improvement should also contribute to the neighborhood character. 
C.  The design standards that follow are divided between the public areas and the private areas. The public areas include the public right-of-way (ROW) and public parks and amenities. The private areas, which are comprised in two categories, include the buildings, parking, and amenities of: 
1.  Private areas which are available to the public on private property such as commercial and industrial development; and 
2.  Private areas that would not be available to the general public such as private residences.

(3)  The form of new construction for Division "C" buildings shall be integrated with existing commercial historic structures to create and reinforce the spatial definition of the street alignment. Form of the street can be influenced by the size, shape, massing and materials of new construction facing the edges of the right-of-way. This form may be created by the construction of a new, stand-alone commercial building or an infill building. The relationship of a building's form to the Old Town Overlay District street grid pattern is critical to maintaining the character of the district. 
(4)  Infill buildings shall be similar in setback, roof form, cornice line and materials, to one of the adjacent buildings. Relate height of new buildings to the heights of adjacent structures. New construction for Division "C" buildings shall not tower over, or be significantly lower than, existing buildings as depicted in figure 4.19 below. 

(5)  Façades of new construction for Division "C" buildings shall relate to the façade elements of adjacent buildings and other buildings within the historic district.

EFIS/Stucco shall be a permitted material for the parapet cornice specified herein. 
(e)  Variations to the roof profile for those sections of a corner façade that contain at least one or more curvilinear, domed or arched formations at the roofline. 
(3)  Buildings will be designed to accommodate City of Burleson required visibility triangles without compromising the corner design. 
(4)  The dominant primary cladding material should transition at a reasonable distance around building corners. (See Figure 4.21 below for acceptable examples) 

c.  Façades for Division "C" buildings shall be organized into three major components; the base, body, and the cap, where: 
(1)  BASE: Is the ground level, where the building makes contact with the earth, 
(2)  BODY: Is the upper middle portion of the architecture, forming the majority of the structure, and 
(3)  CAP: Is the parapet, entablature or roofline, where the building meets the sky.

c.  Acceptable architectural styles for Division "I" buildings are listed below (these styles may also be chosen for Division "C" buildings): 
(1)  Second Empire Victorian (1850s to 1885). This style was created as part of the picturesque movement that looked to the romantic past for inspiration. The squared mansard roof line is not only considered to be aesthetically pleasing, but also practical as it allows for the utilization of an additional story (See Figure 4.22 below). 
(a)  Characteristics of Second Empire Victorian style: 
- Two to three stories in height. 
- Roof composed of patterned shingle, Mansard roof with straight, flared, and concave shapes; elaborate dormers. 
- Windows: Tall and narrow double hung, elaborate surrounds. 
- Ornamentation: Decorative brackets and/or ironwork. 
- Siding: Brick and stone with simulated or engineered wood (with a fire rating complying to the adopted building code) moldings slate type shingles for mansard roof. 

(2)  Italianate (1850s to 1885) Originally inspired by Renaissance buildings of Italy, this style is considered a blending of classical and romantic features that became one of the most popular styles in the United States. Because of its ornate details, such as bracketed cornices, this style is easily adapted to storefronts (See Figure 4.23 below). 
(a)  Characteristics of the Italianate style: 
- Double-hung, narrow windows, often with round arch heads. 
- Window panes are either one-over-one or two-over-two.

- Quoins (projecting square surface pattern) at building corners. 
- Flat roof or sloped with a maximum 3:12 pitch. 
- Exaggerated roof parapet molding. 
- Transom, often curved, above the front door. 
- Brackets, modillions and dentil courses. 
- Overall, a vertical emphasis in building proportions. 

(3)  Neoclassical/Georgian Revival (1880s to 1950) The Neoclassical and Georgian Revival styles borrowed elements from earlier Greek and Colonial Revival architectural styles from the early to mid-1800s. It was the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago that propelled both styles into the forefront of the City Beautiful movement for civic and institutional design that dominated college campuses and governmental buildings into the 1950s (See Figure 4.24 below). 
(a)  Characteristics of the Neoclassical/Georgian Revival style: 
- Two to four stories in height. 
- Full-height entrance porch, full-façade portico or porch with round columns with complex capitals. 
- Flat roof with parapet and metal or cast stone cornice; or low-pitched hip roof, with roof-line balustrades, dormers in Classical style. 
- Rectangular windows (sometimes arched) with double-hung sashes, symmetrical, multi-paned.

- Decorative pediments, brackets, cantilevered wall extensions, masonry columns and quoins, botanic garlands, rosettes, trim and brackets. 
- Exterior walls of brick, quarried stone and granite, limestone panels. 

(4)  Art Deco/Moderne (1930s to 1950) This style is most easily identified by its architectural ornament, which includes stylized floral patterns and repetitive geometric forms incorporating sharp angles and segments of circles. Zigzags, chevrons and diamond patterns are typical and often are applied as decorative moldings or are integral to masonry patterns themselves. Glass brick and rounded or angular corner windows are often used. Building entrances are embellished with decoration which extended to hardware and light fixtures (See Figure 4.25 below). 
(a)  Characteristics of the Art Deco/Moderne style: 
- Variety of colors and textures. 
- Molded metal panels or grills. 
- Stucco and tile combined. 
- Stylized floral patterns. 
- Rounded corner windows. 
- Repetitive geometric forms. 
- Colored brick or tile. 
- Zigzag or chevron moldings. 

(5)  Romanesque Revival - Richardsonian Romanesque (1830s to 1885) Named after architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), this style is characterized by heavy, rock-faced stone, round masonry arches, contrasting colors, transom windows arranged in ribbon-like patterns, square towers, and sparse fenestration. Other characteristics include the asymmetrical arrangement of compound arches and square towers of different heights and various roof shapes. A crenellated tower parapet is common (See Figure 4.26 below). 
(a)  Characteristics of the Romanesque Revival - Richardsonian Romanesque style: 
- Semicircular arch. 
- Compound arch. 
- Square tower. 
- Rock-faced stone.

( Ord. No. B-792-10(B0114), § 1(Exh. A), 1-21-2014 ) 
Sec. 4-63. - Buildings. 
A.  Building façades. Façades are the portion of the building subject to public view or forming a wall or boundary to an open space or public space. The primary surface of the wall is the plane from which recesses and projections are measured. The primary surface of the wall will be identified on submittals. 
1.  Build-to-line. Any building located on a lot with frontage on the public ROW, must place the primary surface of the front wall of the building on the front building line for at least 80 percent of the length of the frontage. 
2.  Façade. The quality of the façade determines the quality and character of the adjacent outdoor space. Since the public ROW requires a higher quality façade than the parking lot, the façade regulations are divided into Type A (better quality) and Type B (lesser quality). Type A façades face a public ROW and are designed as the primary front plane of the building that encloses a climate controlled habitable room or rooms, and that contains the primary building entrance. Type B façades face internal parking and alley areas that are typically located at the side and rear of the building. (See Figure 4.27 below) 

3.  Proportions. The proportions of walls, windows, and portions of walls shall be predominately vertical. Areas that are predominately horizontal shall be subdivided by pilasters, mullions, columns, trim work, or other architectural elements to achieve a balanced or vertical appearance. Vertical stripes, however, are undesirable. 
4.  Material specifications. See subsection 4-63(g) materials. 
5.  Towers. Towers afford a gracious and civic method of providing landmarks and consequently should be used sparingly. Locations for towers and ultimate tower height are subject to the approval of the DSRC and the DAC. Towers may project into the ROW a maximum of two feet. 
6.  Pilasters and columns. Pilasters and columns are an expression of the actual or imaginary structural system on the exterior of the building. These elements divide the horizontal façade into smaller, more vertical panels. Pilasters should be placed no farther apart than they are tall and should extend to the eave or above the parapet.

ARTICLE VI. - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT (TOD) DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 6-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of these design standards is to promote a regulatory process that provides options for innovation and significant flexibility to select appropriate building design, landscaping, stormwater management, and other site planning elements, which will ultimately help create developments that are in accordance with the overall concept of transit oriented development by providing for the flexibility of uses, stimulating a broad mix of commercial development, incorporating appropriate residential uses, supporting and sustaining property values of properties within the overlay district as well as those adjacent to it, and creating a quality and unique gateway for Burleson. 
    In order to take advantage of the growing desire for and ultimate development of commuter rail along the Fort Worth-Burleson-Cleburne line, the city and its consultant, Gateway Planning Group, have prepared a land use plan for a transit-oriented development (TOD) in the area. The mixed-use component of the TOD would provide for employment centers, integrated buildings with residential and retail/office components, potential governmental and other public buildings, and parks and open space. Surrounding the mixed-use component is a wide range of residential development, including higher-density condominiums and apartments in the range of 20 dwelling units per acre, and townhome/brownstone and other single family development in the 7-15 dwelling units per acre range. The layout of the overall acreage focuses on neighborhood centers, connected by sidewalks, paths and public trails in the parks, open spaces, and creek areas. The type of development encourages walking, and the compact nature of the development provides for short walking distances from the future rail station site to areas devoted to live, work and play. 
    Alsbury Boulevard and Shaffstall Road are critical elements of the success of the TOD. Through the TOD, these roadways will be designed with a unique cross-section. A "European boulevard" is envisioned so that pedestrian friendly areas and high volume, low speed travel lanes travel lanes can be created and complement each other in the overall design. Within the TOD, the goal is to construct these arterials as a feature of and integrated with the development, rather than a barrier between two different mixed-use developments. Outside the limits of the TOD, these roadways will be typical boulevards or undivided roadways with a center turn lane. Road "A" will provide direct access from both Alsbury Boulevard and Shaffstall Road to the rail station.
