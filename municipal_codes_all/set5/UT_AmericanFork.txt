PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the city of American Fork, Utah. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 2000-06-21, adopted in June, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 ORDINANCE DISPOSITION TABLES ODT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Instruction Sheet 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference.

The city administrator or designee shall supervise the transfer of such property to the department requesting the property and adjust the city inventory control to document the transfer. If no use can be made of the property or is expected to be made within the reasonably foreseeable future, the property shall be disposed of as provided in this section. 
C.  All surplus property is disposed of "as is" with no warranty, guarantee, or representation of any kind, expressed or implied, as to the condition, utility or usability of the property offered. 
D.  If city personal property having a value of one thousand dollars or more becomes surplus, unused, obsolete, unsuitable for public use, or otherwise no longer needed, the property shall be disposed of in accordance with this section. 
a.  The city administrator or a designee shall prepare and present a listing to the city council of all city owned personal property with an estimated value of equal to or more than one thousand dollars, as determined by the city administrator, which is deemed no longer needed by the city and which can be declared surplus by resolution of the city council.

c.  The city shall provide notice of the proposal to declare the property surplus property and to sell and/or exchange the property, and notice of the time and place of the public hearing, by publication of notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, which publication shall be at least ten days prior to the date of the public meeting. After receiving public comment, the city shall, by resolution, declare the property surplus, with or without conditions regarding its disposal, and have the property sold and/or exchanged; or the city shall abandon the matter. If the city declares the property to be surplus property, the city administrator shall select the best disposal option, unless otherwise directed by the city council. Sale of the item, rather than donation, is preferred when significant value is determined. Appropriate methods of disposal are as follows: 
i.  Auction . Surplus property may be sold at public auction. Auctions may be conducted by city staff, or the city may contract with a professional auctioneer or electronic auction site. 
ii.  Sealed bids . Sealed bids may be solicited for the sale of surplus property. Surplus property disposed of in this manner shall be sold to the highest responsible bidder. 
iii.  Selling for scrap . Surplus property may be sold as scrap if the city deems that the value of its parts exceeds the value of the surplus property as a whole. 
iv.  Negotiation with interested buyer . When the city is aware of an interested buyer and deems that it can obtain market value for the surplus property from that buyer, it may dispose of the property through a negotiated transaction. 
v.  Donation . Surplus property may be donated to any other public agency or charitable organization exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
vi.  No value item . Where the City determines that property is surplus and of minimal value to the city due to spoilage, obsolescence or other cause or where the city determines that the cost of disposal of such property would exceed the recovery value, the city shall dispose of the same in such a manner as they deem appropriate and in the best interest of the city. 
d.  For property valued one thousand dollars or more, reasonable notice shall be given to the public prior to disposal. Reasonable notice shall mean publishing a notice of the proposed disposition of personal public property on the city website after the items have been declared surplus and at least fourteen days prior to the disposition. 
E.  All personal property with a value of less than one thousand dollars, as estimated by the city administrator or designee, that becomes surplus, unused, obsolete, unsuitable for public use, or otherwise no longer needed may be disposed of at the discretion of the city administrator or designee, with the consent of the mayor after compliance with subsection B of this section. Disposal of personal property may include, but is not limited to, donating property to a bona fide charity, or transferring property to a salvage or junk yard, or landfill. 
F.  Employees and city officials may bid on surplused property provided they do not take any action for their personal interest or gain that improperly gives them any advantage or benefit, or in aid of others doing the same.

The notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and posted at the city administration building; and

A.  In order to promote the general health, welfare, peace, comfort and safety of the residents of the city of American Fork, and the patrons of businesses that do business within the limits of the city, the city regulates businesses within its city limits for public safety concerns and for compliance with applicable state and local zoning, development, and fire codes, as well as building- and construction-related codes identified and adopted in Title 15 of the code of the city of American Fork, Utah. Such regulation shall include, but not be limited to, administrative, professional and nonenforcement legal services of city personnel rendered in connection with the regulation of businesses, the issuance of business licenses, and questions and issues that arise in connection therewith; business-related clerical record keeping by city personnel; fire and safety code inspections by authorized city representatives prior to the issuance of a business' first business license and at least once every three years thereafter; such law enforcement investigations as may be deemed necessary and proper, or as otherwise required by law or ordinance. No business license for a particular business shall issue until the required city inspections (and any required adjustments and/or repairs made as a result thereof) and required administrative and clerical work of city personnel are completed. 
B.  For the purpose of such regulation and to defray the cost of municipal services provided and associated therewith, an annual license fee shall be levied and assessed for the privilege of engaging in any business in the city during any calendar year or part thereof, pursuant to the licensing fee schedule determined by the city council and set by resolution. 
C.  Commercial businesses and home occupations (as defined by Sections 2-5.24 and 7-2 of the Development Code of American Fork City, Utah) each require such inspections and record keeping (and, where necessary, law enforcement investigations) as hereinabove set forth. Hence, they shall be treated similarly hereunder and assessed the same business license fee. 
D.  A business license issued under this chapter constitutes a license to permit for a specific owner (or set of owners) to conduct a specific business at a specific location within the city limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. 2012-06-17, 6-12-2012)

    License fees shall be levied and assessed against the following specified businesses pursuant to the licensing fee schedule determined by the city council and set by resolution: 
1.  Christmas tree lots, firework stands, and temporary businesses, which-by their nature or the nature of their product-pose a special or increased fire danger. 
2.  Bazaars, boutiques, and open-air markets (sometimes referred to as "flea markets" or "swap meets")-where there are multiple vendors in a limited space, where such vendors change or may change from time to time, where such periodic change results or may result in a different physical arrangement of booths or the sale of different types of products or services from time to time within the limited space, and where the proximity of vendors to one another and the high density of patrons pose issues and concerns atypical of home occupations and commercial businesses generally-thus increasing the need for monitoring and periodic inspections to protect the public health and safety. 
3.  Amusement devices. 
4.  Trucks or delivery vehicles for ice cream vendors. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. 04-01-04, § IV, 1-11-2005; Ord. No. 2012-06-17, 6-12-2012)

(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. 2012-06-17, 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 5.04.160. - Fees-New businesses. 
    The license fees for new businesses shall be due and payable on or before the date that business is first commenced. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998) 
Sec. 5.04.170. - Special situations-Appeals. 
A.  In cases where an applicant for a license is denied a license (including but not limited to those situations where the applicant applies for a business license where the business or manner of conducting such business does not readily appear to be covered by the provisions of this chapter), or where the applicant believes that (due to special circumstances) a particular provision herein works an undue hardship in his case, such applicant may appeal to, or request a hearing before, the city administrator, which appeal or hearing shall be granted within five working days from the date of appeal or request. The city administrator or his designate shall not have the authority to change or disregard a specific requirement of this chapter; but he shall and is hereby authorized to interpret the requirements and provisions of this chapter liberally so as to promote and ensure that the spirit and purposes of this chapter are carried out. 
B.  In the event that the matter cannot be resolved with the city administrator or his designate, then-except in those situations where an appeal lies or is determined to lie with the city's board of adjustment-the applicant may appeal to the city council for a determination of the matter. He shall, in writing, indicate the substance of his appeal, summarize the determination made by the city administrator, furnish written proof and affidavits in support of his request, and request that the matter be heard by the city council; this written notice of appeal is filed by the applicant with the city recorder. The matter shall then be noticed to the public, and the city council shall hear said appeal within thirty days of the filing of the appeal with the city recorder. The city council may, after hearing, deny the appeal, grant a special exception to the applicant (by modifying or waiving one or more minor requirements of this chapter for the applicant), or take steps to amend by ordinance the provisions of this chapter to facilitate (or remove the barrier to) the matter appealed or requested. The council shall determine what constitutes a "minor" requirement for which a special exception may be granted. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998) 
Sec. 5.04.180. - Fees-Late payment-Penalty. 
A.  For purposes of this section only, a "licensee" is one who had a business license for a specific business during the prior calendar year, and has not yet renewed the business license or indicated that he or she is no longer in business; or one who did not have a business license for a specific business during the prior calendar year and who is in business without a business license. 
B.  If any license fee is not paid within thirty days of the due date, the account shall be considered delinquent, and a late fee (administrative penalty) of fifteen dollars shall be assessed and added to the original amount thereof; provided, that where no business license has previously issued for the business being conducted, there shall be assessed an additional administrative penalty of fifty dollars for engaging in business without the required license. These administrative penalties are and shall be in addition to any civil or criminal penalty that may be assessed by a court of law for the violation of this chapter. 
C.  A written notice shall be sent via regular mail, postage-prepaid, to the licensee advising the licensee of (1) the purported delinquent status of the account, (2) the enhanced amount then due and owing, (3) the fact that the licensee may dispute the existence of such delinquency within thirty days of the date of the letter, (4) the fact that it is illegal to conduct business until the alleged delinquency is cured in full, and (5) the fact that, if the account is not cured within thirty days of the date of written notice, the account may be turned over to the city attorney for action. 
D.  If the license fee and administrative fee or fees are not paid within thirty days following the mailing of the above written notice, the account may immediately be turned over to the city attorney for action thereon. 
E.  Reasonable attorney fees and legal costs incurred by or otherwise associated with the enforcement of this chapter, against a delinquent licensee, shall be assessed and added to the amount due and owing to the city, whether or not judicial action is commenced to enforce the collection thereof. 
F.  All penalties provided for in this section shall be collected by the city and payment thereof enforced in the same manner as the license fees are collected and payment thereof enforced. 
G.  No license shall be issued until all penalties legally assessed have been paid in full. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998) 
Sec. 5.04.190. - Delinquency-City remedies. 
    If any person subject to license under any ordinance of the city fails, refuses or neglects to file his application for the license and/or to pay the license fee or fees provided by ordinance within the time prescribed by ordinance, the city shall determine the amount of the license fee or fees due from any information which may be available, and such determination shall be prima facie correct. The city shall thereupon proceed to collect such license fee or fees by all lawful means, including but not limited to a suit for damages and/or injunctive relief. Such lawful means are in addition to any administrative remedy and/or criminal sanctions provided for under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 98-01-07, § 1(part), 1998)

    Every license fee or assessment levied by any ordinance of the city, and all interest accruing thereon after the date of delinquency, and all penalties levied or assessed thereon by any ordinance of the city for failure to pay the same within the time required, constitute a debt to the city, and the city may maintain an action to recover the same and all costs associated therewith, including a reasonable attorney's fee, in any court of competent jurisdiction, which remedy shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be provided.

Such certificate shall be signed by the mayor and attested to by the city recorder; shall constitute the sole evidence of the purchaser's intent recognized by the city; and may be filed with and recorded by the Utah County Recorder. A certified copy of such certificate shall remain on file at the office of the city sexton. 
(Ord. No. 85-09-20, § II(8.04.31), 1985) 
Sec. 8.04.050. - Burial lots-Purchase procedures-Fees. 
    Except as provided in this section, the full amount of the purchase price and perpetual care fees shall be paid at the time such burial plot is purchased. Where, however, the immediate family of a decedent does not have or cannot obtain sufficient funds to purchase a plot large enough to permit the subsequent interment of other family members desirous of being interred alongside such decedent, the city sexton is authorized to inter or cause to be interred such decedent in a vacant lot within the cemetery, so long as there remains a vacant lot, and provided that the family of such decedent purchases the spot wherein such decedent shall be interred and at least one other contiguous spot within the lot and pays for the same prior to the interment of such decedent, receiving and having recorded a certificate of burial rights to the same. In such case, the sexton may, pursuant to contract, reserve such other spots in said lot as are requested by the family and for which an amount equal to ten percent of the purchase price is tendered to and received by the sexton at the time the initial spots are purchased. Such additional payment and contact shall constitute an option and shall be recorded and noted upon the cemetery plats of the city. The family shall then have the exclusive right to tender in one lump sum the full purchase price (minus a credit for the option price payment which shall be credited thereto) required on such other spots, at the price in effect at the time such option was created, anytime within the following twelve months. If such option is not exercised, the option payment shall be retained by the city for the care and maintenance of the cemetery grounds in its perpetual care fund. If such option is exercised, a certificate of burial rights to such spots shall be issued and recorded upon payment of the full purchase price and perpetual care fees.

A.  The transferor shall fill out and sign an affidavit form prepared and issued by the city which shall state, inter alia, that all right and interest in the burial plot, or a specified portion thereof, are thereby transferred to the designated transferee; 
B.  The transferee shall tender to the city sexton a transfer fee which shall be set by resolution of the city council; 
C.  Upon receipt of such affidavit and transfer fee, the sexton shall prepare and issue a new certificate of burial rights concerning such plot or portion thereof, maintaining a certified copy of the same on file in his office, and shall record such transfer in the city records as provided in Section 8.04.030(D).

In such cases, the personal representative shall execute the affidavit described above in Section 8.04.070(A) and shall sign the same on behalf of the decedent. A new certificate of burial rights shall then issue to the devisee or heir in the same manner as in the case of an inter vivos transfer, and the same shall be recorded in the records of the city.

    The spouse of an owner of any plot which contains more than one burial spot has a vested right of interment in such plot, and any person thereafter becoming the spouse of the owner also has such vested right if more than one burial spot is unoccupied at the time such person becomes the spouse of the owner. Such right may be divested, however, by a final decree of divorce or by the subsequent remarriage of the spouse after the death of the decedent, unless otherwise provided by will.

A.  Double deep burials will only be permitted in lots that are completely unused (no existing burial in lot) and that are eligible for double deep burials. As determined by the cemetery sexton, some lots will not be available for double-deep burials due to soil compaction. No double deep burials will be permitted in the recently developed hillside section due to the high water table.

Sec. 8.04.300. - Perpetual care-Fees-Delinquency-Notice-Hearing-Revestment. 
    As an alternative remedy, the city may cancel the owner's certificate of burial rights to the extent of his unused spots required to rectify such deficiency and cause title to the same to revest in the city; provided, that the following procedures are complied with by the city: 
A.  The city sexton, upon discovering that a plot owner is delinquent in such payments for a period of two years, shall send, by regular mail, a notice of default to such owner, requesting that payment be made, in full, within thirty days of receipt of such notice. 
B.  If such notice is not answered or heeded for a period of thirty-five days after such mailing, then the city sexton shall notify the city council of such default and shall request that appropriate action be taken. 
C.  The city council shall then fix a time and place for a hearing to be held at which the owner shall be given the opportunity to present to the council good cause, if such exists, as to why his right to future use of the spots should not be terminated and the title thereto revested in the city for resale. 
D.  Written notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be personally served upon the owner or mailed, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of such owner. 
E.  If notice cannot be made pursuant to subsection D of this section, a notice of such hearing shall be published, at least once a week for three consecutive weeks prior to such hearing, in a newspaper having general circulation in the county. 
F.  If the plot owner is known to be deceased, then mailing of notices under this section shall be made to the last-known address of any heirs of the decedent known to have rights of interment therein or who claim to be devisees to such spots. 
G.  Copies of such notice shall further be posted in three conspicuous public places in the city. 
H.  At the time set for the hearing, the city council shall allow the plot owner (or those claiming through him) an opportunity to be heard and a right to call witnesses and present testimony. 
I.  After due consideration of all the facts presented at such hearing, the city council shall issue its decision on the matter. If it finds that there has been a failure to make payment of the alleged delinquency without compelling reason therefor or that no satisfactory arrangements have been proferred by such plot owner for making the immediate payment of the same, the city council may order that, if such delinquent amount is not paid within ten working days of the hearing, the burial spot or spots shall revert to the municipality for resale and that all rights and privileges of such owner in the spot or spots be terminated. In such case, the city may sell such spot or spots in the same manner as it sells any other spot within the cemetery and shall retain the proceeds of such resale. 
J.  The plot owner shall retain the right to pay, in full, and with interest accruing at the rate of twenty percent from the date of such default, the delinquent payment or fees at any time prior to five p.m. of the tenth working day following the rendering of the council's adverse determination. If such payment is not so received, interest in the spot or spots shall automatically revest in the city. 
K.  The number of such spots which shall revest in the city shall be determined and computed by dividing the amount of the deficiency by the selling price of such spots when originally conveyed to the defaulting plot owner and rounding up to the next whole number where a fraction results. If there are not sufficient unused spots to satisfy the delinquency, the plot owner shall remain personally liable to the city for such excess delinquency. 
(Ord. No. 85-09-20, § II(8.04.72), 1985) 
Sec. 8.04.310. - Abandoned lots-Forfeiture-Trial. 
    The remedy of forfeiture, for lots or portions thereof declared to be abandoned by their owners, shall be governed by the applicable provisions of Chapter 5, Title 8, of the Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended, as follows: 
A.  The fact that a plot conveyed by the city has not been used for the purpose of interment for a period in excess of sixty years and that during such time the plot owner: 
1.  Has not provided the care to such plot provided uniformly to all lots or spots within the cemetery, including but not limited to the payment of any required perpetual care or capital improvement assessments, and 
2.  Has not given to the city a written notice of claim or interest in such plot, shall be prima facie evidence that the plot has been abandoned by such plot owner or those claiming under him. 
B.  If a plot is deemed abandoned pursuant to subsection A of this section, then the city sexton shall, in a manner consistent with Rules 4 and 5 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, serve written notice upon the plot owner or persons claiming under him. Such notice shall state the facts evidencing abandonment and shall demand that such plot owner or persons claiming through him file with the city, within fifty days after service of such notice, written notice of claim or interest in and to such plot and satisfactory evidence of such claim or interest (e.g., a certificate of burial rights, a cemetery deed, or a copy of a will provision specifically devising such plot), and that any delinquent fees or assessment be paid. 
C.  Failure to comply with such demand or notice within the requisite period shall permit the city to bring an action, in the district court for Utah County, against all persons who have so failed to comply for the purpose of terminating their rights in the unused portion of the plot and of revesting title to the same in the city. Such action shall be brought and determined in the same manner as any other action concerning real property. 
D.  If evidence is submitted by the city at trial, sufficient to show the existence of abandonment under subsection A of this section, and the same is not rebutted by the affected parties, the court shall render judgment for the city. 
E.  A certified copy of such judgment shall be filed with the Utah County recorder and with the city sexton. 
F.  The proceeds from the subsequent resale of any spot within such plot, less the costs and expenses incurred in the court action, shall become a permanent part of the perpetual care fund of the city, unless later disposed of pursuant to Section 10-6-131 of the Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act, Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended. 
G.  As a alternative to the procedure set forth in subsections B through E of this section, the city council may pass a resolution demanding that the plot owner or those persons claiming under him file with the city sexton a notice of claim or interest in such plot. A copy of the resolution shall be personally served on the plot owner in accordance with Rules 4 and 5 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Such resolution shall notify the owner that he must, within sixty days after service of such resolution, express interest in maintaining the cemetery lot, submit satisfactory evidence of an intention to use such plot for interment, and pay any delinquent fees or assessments. If personal service on such plot owner cannot be made, the city council must publish its resolution at least once a week, for three consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. In such case, a copy of the resolution shall be mailed to the owner's last known address, if available, within fourteen days of publication. If, after sixty days from the date of personal service or the last date of publication of the city council's resolution, the plot owner (or persons claiming through such plot owner) fails to state valid interest in the use of such burial plot and to pay any delinquent fees or assessments, the rights of such plot owner and those claiming through him shall be terminated and revested in the city. 
H.  Should the burial spot or spots of a plot owner revert to the city pursuant to this section, the plot owner or those claiming through him shall have the right, upon presentation of a certificate of burial rights thereto and payment of any delinquent assessments or fees, and at the city's option, to: 
1.  Be compensated for the spot or spots at their current selling price at the time such certificate is presented to the city; or 
2.  Receive a right of interment in another spot or spots located within the cemetery if the original spot or spots of such plot owner have since been resold by the city; or 
3.  Regain the right of the interment in the original spot or spots if the same have not been resold by the city.

Any deposit required will be in addition to hookup fees for newly established water and/or sewer services. 
B.  Such agreement and application shall comply with the form as established by American Fork City, and be in compliance with Utah State Code, to be reviewed and updated periodically to adhere to any municipal, county, or State of Utah requirements. 
(Prior code, § 24-4; Ord. No. 82-10-20, § 1, 1982; Ord. No. 2004-06-17, § I, 6-8-2004; Ord. No. 2012-06-16, 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 13.04.020. - Statement of costs-Remedies for delinquent payments. 
A.  The city treasurer shall, at such times as required by the city council, mail (or cause to be mailed) a written statement ("utility bill") to each person or business receiving culinary water, sewer, storm drain collection, and/or garbage collection services from the city, stating the amount of the utility bill assessed against such person or business, and when and where the same is payable. 
B.  If any person or business neglects, refuses or fails to pay such utility bill, in full, as assessed by the city, within twenty days from the date of such statement, the treasurer is authorized and empowered to have the utility (including water) services to said person's or business' property disconnected and/or terminated in accordance with the provisions of this code and the laws of the state of Utah, until such time as all delinquent utility charges [including any accrued late fee(s) and/or interest] are paid in full, plus an additional reconnection fee as shall be set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
C.  The city treasurer is authorized and empowered to enforce (or cause to be enforced) the payment of all delinquent utility charges (1) by an action at law, in the name of the city; and/or (2) by such other remedy or remedies as the city may have at law and/or in equity to enforce the terms of the agreement referenced in and provided by Section 13.04.010 of this code, and/or as otherwise provided by applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule and/or regulation of the state of Utah and/or the city of American Fork. Such remedies are cumulative, and the exercise by the city of a particular remedy shall not deprive it of the right or exercise of any other remedy or remedies deemed necessary thereby for the collection of such delinquent amounts. 
D.  Any utility account for which the utility bill has not been paid in full, by the due date for such payment, shall be considered delinquent and shall be subject to the assessment of a late fee. The late fee, which shall be assessed each month that the account is and/or remains delinquent, shall be ten percent of the amount owing and unpaid (including any accrued late fees and/or interest) as of 8:00 a.m., the day following the due date for such utility bill payment; provided, that, in no case, shall the amount of the late charge be less than ten dollars for the month, except that no late charge shall be assessed if the utility bill is paid in full prior to the date that the city has commenced the process (including data input) for preparing and sending out the utility bill for the next billing cycle. 
E.  Over billing. When there has been an overcharge, the customer will be credited up to twelve months to correct the error. 
    The city shall not be required to make a refund, or give a credit for, over billing/overpayment which occurred more than twelve months before the customer disputed their bill. 
F.  Under billing. When a customer has been undercharged and the undercharge has been going on for three months or less, the city will back bill the full amount of the undercharge. 
    If the undercharge has been going on for a period longer than three months or the date the error began cannot be determined, the utility billing supervisor will review the undercharge, determine if the customer should have recognized the error, and whether or not additional billing is justified. 
    If additional back billing is justified, the city will follow the state of Utah Administrative Code R746-320-8 Billing Adjustments rules which do not allow back billing to exceed twenty-four months. Utility billing will provide a written statement to the customer in the event that the back bill covers more than the twenty-four-month period with the reasons of why the city did not limit the back bill. 
    All undercharged customers will be back billed for the first three months of the error regardless of whether or not additional back billing is determined to be justified.

ARTICLE V. - STORM SEWER UTILITY 
CHAPTER 13.70 - STORM SEWER UTILITY 

Sec. 13.70.010. - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings regarding stormwater runoff and the city's storm sewer system: 
A.  The city's existing storm sewer system consists of a network of man-made and natural facilities, structures and conduits, including groundwater and aquifers, that collect and route stormwater runoff. 
B.  The city's existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the stormwater runoff generated in the city. 
C.  The city's anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate storm sewer system. 
D.  Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff causes erosion, property damage, and unsafe conditions. 
E.  Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may hinder the city's ability to provide emergency services to its residents. 
F.  Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city. 
G.  Uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may pose health hazards to the citizens of the community. 
H.  All developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces. 
I.  All developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the city's operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system. 
J.  Absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control, existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the city, its residents, and its businesses. 
K.  A storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each property in the city pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 97-03-12, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 13.70.020. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the city's storm sewer system, managing and controlling stormwater runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted waters from entering the city's water supply and other receiving waters, and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction, operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 97-03-12, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 13.70.030. - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases shall be defined as follows: 
A.  Developed parcel shall mean any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition by grading, filling, or the construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces. 
B.  Equivalent Service Unit (ESU) shall mean the average amount of impervious surface, expressed in square feet, on developed single family residential parcels in American Fork. 
C.  Impervious surface shall mean any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rate of flow than the natural surface. 
(Ord. No. 97-03-12, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 13.70.040. - Storm sewer utility. 
A.  Creation. The city council hereby creates and establishes a storm sewer utility as part of the city's overall sewer system. The storm sewer utility shall plan, design, construct, maintain, administer and operate the city's storm sewer system. 
B.  Enterprise fund. The city council hereby establishes a storm sewer utility enterprise fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial transactions related to the storm sewer utility. All storm sewer utility service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund. Money in the storm sewer utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other city funds. However, the storm sewer utility may pay other city funds for services and expenses directly attributable to the storm sewer utility. The enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy. 
C.  Facilities and assets. The storm sewer utility shall operate independently of city operations funded by the general fund. The storm sewer utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities, such as the water utility and the sanitary sewer (waste water) utility. Upon creation of the utility, all of the city's storm sewer facilities and assets (other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city administrator) shall be transferred to the storm sewer utility in consideration for the storm sewer utility's agreement to take primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, administering and operating the city's storm sewer system. 
D.  Administration. The storm sewer utility shall be administered by and under the direction of the city administrator. 
(Ord. No. 97-03-12, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 13.70.050. - Storm sewer utility fee. 
A.  Imposed. Each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be charged a storm sewer utility fee. 
B.  ESU. The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units (ESUs) contained in the parcel. The city council finds that the ESU is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility. Based upon an engineering study commissioned by the city, the city council finds and establishes that one ESU equals three thousand four hundred square feet of impervious surface area. 
C.  Calculation. The city council finds that each single family residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff; therefore, each developed single family residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one ESU. All non-single family residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate, expressed in ESUs, according to the measured impervious area on the parcel. The city council may adopt separate rates for residential planned unit developments (PUDs), condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule. 
D.  Charge per ESU. The amount charged for each ESU shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
E.  Exemptions and credits. The city council may establish exemptions and credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution. 
F.  Policies. The city administrator may adopt policies, consistent with this ordinance and any resolutions passed by the city council, to assist in the application, administration and interpretation of this ordinance and any resolutions related to the storm sewer utility. 
G.  Appeals. 
1.  Any person or entity that believes that this ordinance or any storm sewer utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied erroneously, may appeal to the city administrator. The appeal shall be in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be submitted to the city administrator within ten days of the decision, action, or bill being appealed. 
2.  The city administrator may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. 
3.  The city administrator shall decide and issue a written memorandum decision on the appeal within fifteen working days of when the appeal is filed, unless a hearing is held-in which case, the decision shall be issued within ten working days after the date of said hearing, or within fifteen working days of when the appeal is filed, whichever date is later. The memorandum decision shall include the reasons or grounds for the decision. 
4.  If the person or entity is not satisfied with the city administrator's decision, a further appeal may be made to the city council. The appeal to the city council shall be made in writing, shall include a copy of the original appeal filed with the city and the city administrator's memorandum decision thereon, and shall be filed with the city recorder within ten days after the date of said memorandum decision. The city council shall hear the appeal not less than seven and not more than twenty-five days after the date that the appeal is filed with the city recorder-so that it can be promptly yet adequately reviewed by the city council and noticed and/or posted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Sections 52-4-1, et seq., Utah Code Annotated (1953, as amended) (Utah Open and Public Meetings Act). The city council's decision on the appeal shall be final and binding on all parties. 
(Ord. No. 97-03-12, § 1(part), 1997) 
Sec. 13.70.060. - Billing. 
    The city council finds that the city's storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system, culinary water system, and solid waste collection system are interrelated services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible manner. Therefore, the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on the city's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no regular utility bill for the property, the storm sewer utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property. All properties shall be charged the fee. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water service, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available to the city to enforce this ordinance.

CHAPTER 13.90 - CONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS GUIDELINES AND LOCAL APPELLATE PROCEDURE 

Sec. 13.90.010. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide advisory guidelines for the city to assist the city in identifying actions that may involve the unconstitutional taking or damaging of private real property without the payment of just compensation as required by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Utah. 
(Ord. No. 2003-08-28, § I, 8-12-2003) 
Sec. 13.90.020. - Constitutional taking. 
    "Constitutional taking" means governmental actions involving the physical taking or exaction, or the regulatory taking, of private real property by the city that might reasonably and foreseeably require compensation to a private real property owner under: (a) the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; (b) Article I, Section 22 of the Constitution of the state of Utah; and/or (c) any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of the private real property by a governmental entity. 
(Ord. No. 2003-08-28, § I, 8-12-2003) 
Sec. 13.90.030. - Policy and guidelines. 
A.  It is the policy of the city that: 
1.  Any physical taking and/or exaction of private real property bear an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest. 
2.  Any exaction be roughly proportionate and reasonably related, both in nature and extent, to the impact caused by the activity or activities which are the subject of the decision or action being reviewed. 
3.  No individual bear burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the community as a whole. 
B.  The guidelines set forth in this section shall be considered by the city when taking any action that might reasonably and foreseeably result in the physical taking or exaction, or the regulatory taking, of private real property. 
C.  The city should review the following to determine and identify whether a proposed government action raises constitutional taking issues: 
1.  Does the action result in a permanent or inevitably recurring physical occupation of private property? 
2.  Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an easement to the city without the payment of just compensation? 
3.  Does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent or ongoing nuisance, originating on city property, that impacts neighboring lands so that they sustain a special and unreasonable interference with the quiet enjoyment of their property? 
4.  Does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership such as the right to reasonable access, the right to light, air and view within the right-of-way of a public street that abuts private property, or the right to exclude others from the private property? 
5.  Does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected and vested right, such as the right to continue a nonconforming use; the right to have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a complete application was submitted; or legally issued subdivision plat approvals, building permits, licenses; or other protected property interests? 
6.  Does the action impose a severe economic burden that is determined to be unfair when considered in light of (a) the burden placed on the property owner, (b) the nature of the government action and benefit, and (c) the property owner's investment-backed expectations? 
7.  Does the action deprive the property owner of any economically viable use of the property where there exists at least one viable use which does not constitute a nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety? 
8.  Does the action limit the use of private property without substantially advancing a legitimate public interest? 
9.  Has the city demonstrated by an individualized determination that any conditions, dedications or exactions imposed on development applications place only fair and proportionate burdens on development and do not unreasonably impose burdens that significantly exceed the burdens that the proposed development places on public utilities, streets and other services? 
10.  Does the action discriminate against property owners that are similarly situated to other property owners without a reasonable basis for doing so? 
(Ord. No. 2003-08-28, § I, 8-12-2003) 
Sec. 13.90.040. - Analysis. 
A.  If the city determines that a governmental action involves constitutional taking issues, the proposed decision or action should be reviewed by the city to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken. 
B.  In reviewing the proposed action, the following factors may be analyzed: 
1.  The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property. 
2.  The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking. 
3.  Any reasonable, practical, available and financially feasible alternatives to the proposed action that may fulfill the city's lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking. 
4.  The estimated cost to the city for payment of compensation if the decision or action were later determined to be a constitutional taking. 
(Ord. No. 2003-08-28, § I, 8-12-2003)

Sec. 15.01.370. - Control of groundwater. 
    All trenches shall be kept free from water during excavation, fine grading, pipe laying, jointing, and embedment operations. Where the trench bottom is unstable because of the presence of groundwater, and in cases where the static groundwater elevation is above the bottom of any trench, such groundwater shall be lowered to the extent necessary to keep the trench free from water and the trench bottom stable when the work within the trench is in progress. The surface water shall be prevented from entering trenches. Clay dams will be required at all structures prior to or up-gradient of each manhole or a minimum of two hundred feet to prevent mining of fines within the trench backfill. All water pumped from the trenches shall be conveyed to existing drainage channels, gutters, or drains. Any conflicts and costs incurred by the improper disposal of this water shall be borne by the contractor. No surface or subsurface water shall be allowed to enter the existing city sewer system. High groundwater areas may require special construction practices to prevent pipe flotation, both during and after construction. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.3, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.380. - Excavation for pipeline. 
    All sewer lines shall be excavated and constructed starting at the existing facilities and proceeding continuously up stream with no interim segments left unconstructed. No variance therefrom shall be allowed except upon written approval by the city engineer. 
    Excavation for pipelines shall be located as shown on the approved construction drawing or as staked in the field. Excavation for pipelines shall follow lines parallel to and equidistant from the location of the pipe centerline. Provide neat cut on asphalt surfaces to be removed during trench work to prevent excessive asphalt damage. Trenches shall be excavated to the depths and widths required to accommodate the construction of the pipelines, as follows: 
A.  Mechanical excavation of trenches shall not extend below an elevation of four inches below the bottom of the pipe after placement in its final position. All additional excavation necessary for preparation of the trench bottom shall be made manually. Any unauthorized excavation made below grade for any reason shall be backfilled as specified under "foundation stabilization." 
B.  Excavation for trenches in cobble-rock, stones, mud or other material unsatisfactory for pipe foundation, shall extend to a depth of at least four inches below the bottom of the pipe. A bedding material shall be placed and thoroughly compacted with mechanical tampers in four-inch lifts to provide a smooth, stable foundation. Bedding material shall consist of suitable earth materials free from roots, sod, or organic matter. Trench bottoms shall be hand shaped. 
Where unstable earth or mud is encountered in the excavation at the grade of the pipe, a stable foundation must be created by removing the unsuitable material and backfilling with foundation stabilization material (depth six inches to twenty-four inches as required). 
The unsuitable wet material or muck shall be hauled off and disposed of by the contractor. The contractor shall take whatever measures are necessary to prevent the dry and wet trench materials from being co-mingled. 
C.  The trench shall be excavated such that the pipe is always centered in the trench. The maximum width of trench, measured at the top of the pipe, shall be as narrow as possible but not wider than fifteen inches on each side of the pipe. The above trench guidance shall not limit the trench width where greater widths are necessary as per ASTM standards or manufacturer recommendations. Greater trench widths may be used only upon the approval of the public works director. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.4, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.390. - Foundation stabilization. 
    Wherever the subgrade material does not afford a sufficiently solid foundation to support the pipe, the super-imposed load, and where water must be drained to maintain a dry bottom for pipe installation, the subgrade shall be excavated to the specified depth and replaced with crushed rock or gravel. 
    Gravel for pipe foundations shall be clean crushed rock or gravel conforming to the following gradation: 
Screen % Passing 11/2 100 3/4" 5  
    The gravel material shall be deposited over the entire trench width in six-inch maximum layers, each layer shall be compacted by tamping, rolling, vibrating, spading, slicing, rodding or by combination of one or more of these methods. In addition the material shall be graded to produce a uniform and continuous support for the installed pipe. Care should be taken to make sure that soil migration does not occur. Filter fabric may be necessary in situations where fines from existing material would have a tendency to migrate into the gravel pipe foundation. Control of soil migration is essential with flexible pipes where the soil envelope is the main structure of the pipe. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.5, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.400. - Sheeting, bracing and shoring of excavations. 
    Excavation shall be sheeted, braced, and shored as required to support the walls of the excavations to eliminate sliding and settling and as may be required to protect the workers, the work in progress, and existing utilities, structures and improvements from damage due to sliding and settling of trench walls. All such sheeting, bracing, and shoring shall comply with the requirements of the Utah State Industrial Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident prevention and safety provisions of the contract. 
    All damage resulting from lack of adequate sheeting, bracing, and shoring shall be the responsibility of the contractor, and the contractor shall affect all necessary repairs or reconstruction resulting from such damage. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.6, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.410. - Access to trenches. 
    Safe and suitable ladders, which project two feet above the top of the trench, shall be provided for all trenches over five feet in depth. One ladder shall be provided for each one hundred feet of open trench, or fraction thereof, and be so located that workmen in the trench need not involve more than fifty feet to a ladder and meet all other OSHA requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.7, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.420. - Backfilling. 
    The contractor shall not proceed to backfill until each section of utility line has been inspected by the city. Backfill shall be carefully placed around and over pipes and shall not be permitted to fall directly on a pipe from such a height as to cause damage. In these specifications, the process of preparing the trench bottom to receive the pipe to a level at the pipe center line (spring line) is defined as bedding except for plastic, corrugated metal in which case the bedding is considered to extend to twelve inches above the top of the pipe. Where the excavated material has rocks over two inches in diameter or soils do not meet ASTM requirements, the zone shall be backfilled with modified bedding materials meeting the following gradations: one hundred percent passing, a one-inch screen and five percent passing a No. 4 sieve. 
    The bedding material shall first be placed so that the pipe is supported for the full length of the barrel with full bearing on the bottom segment of the pipe equal to a minimum of one-half of the diameter of the barrel, then the remainder of the bedding shall be placed. Alternative outside methods of pipe laying which are recommended by the pipe manufacturer may be used if approved by the city engineer. 
    Trench backfilling above the level of the pipe bedding shall normally be accomplished with native excavated materials and shall be free from frozen earth, organic material, rocks and solid objects larger than eight inches in diameter, except as required to protect pipe as per manufacturers specifications. 
    The backfill in all utility trenches shall be ether compacted or consolidated according to the requirements of the materials being placed. The in-place density shall be a minimum of ninety-five percent of the maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D 1557 (modified Proctor compaction test) for all granular materials. The city engineer may approve the use of AASHTO T-99 (standard Proctor compaction test) only when materials being compacted warrant consideration of such measurement methods as recommended by the Utah Chapter of the American Public Works Association or other recognized city standard reference publication for a given material type or other reasons as deemed appropriate for use of the AASHTO T-99 method. The ASTM D 1557 method shall be considered the default standard for all compaction efforts. Perform a minimum of one test per two hundred linear feet of trench per eight-inch material lift depth of trench backfill to assure overall compliance. Each utility lateral trench shall be considered a separate trench for purposes of minimum testing requirements. In the event that testing indicates additional compaction is required, perform additional compaction efforts with commensurate additional testing as needed to assure compliance. The city engineer shall approval all trench backfill prior to proceeding to any pavement system placement on a utility trench. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.8, 7-10-2007; Ord. No. 2012-05-15, § 1, 5-8-2012) 
Sec. 15.01.430. - Consolidation of backfill. 
    Consolidation of backfill to within four feet of the ground surface shall be mechanically compacted by means of tamping rollers, sheep foot rollers, pneumatic tire rollers, vibrating rollers, or other mechanical tampers. 
    All precautions necessary shall be taken by the contractor to prevent damage and movement (including floating) of the pipeline, structures and existing adjacent improvements and utilities. The allowance of the use of consolidation methods shall not be construed as guaranteeing or implying that the use of such methods will not result in damage to adjacent ground. The contractor shall make his own determination in this regard and shall assume all risks and liability for settlement or lateral movement of adjacent ground, or improvements, or utilities, either on the surface of the ground or underground. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.9, 7-10-2007) 
Sec. 15.01.440. - Compaction of backfill (top four feet of trench). 
    Backfill shall be compacted by means of sheepsfoot rollers, pneumatic tire rollers, vibrating, rollers, or other mechanical tampers. The backfill in all utility trenches shall be either compacted or consolidated according to the requirements of the materials being placed. Under pavements, or other surface improvements, and within three feet of finished grade the in-place density shall be a minimum of ninety-five percent of laboratory standard maximum dry density as determined by AASHTO T-99. Perform a minimum of one test per five hundred lineal feet of trench per two feet depth of trench to assure overall compliance. In the event that testing indicates additional compaction is required, perform additional testing as needed to assure compliance. 
    Where compaction methods are used, the material shall be placed at a moisture content such that after compaction, the required relative densities will be produced; also, the material shall be placed in lifts which, prior to the compaction, shall not exceed eight inches. 
    Prior to compaction, each layer shall be evenly spread and moistened. 
    If the required relative density is not attained, test sections will be required to determine any adjustments in compacting equipment, thickness of layers, moisture content, and compactive effort necessary to attain the specified minimum relative density. 
    Approval of equipment, thickness of layers, moisture content, and compactive effort shall not be deemed to relieve the contractor of the responsibility for attaining the specified minimum relative densities. The contractor in planning his work shall allow sufficient time to perform the work connected with test sections, and to permit tests for relative densities. 
    If, in the judgment of the city engineer or the public works director, the trench shows signs of being improperly backfilled, or if settlement occurs, the contractor will be required to re-open the trench to a depth required for proper compaction, refilled, and recompacted, all in accordance with these specifications and to the satisfaction of city engineer or the public works director. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, § 4.10, 7-10-2007)

Contractor shall meet with city designated inspection representative prior any construction commencing to review city standards relative to installation of piping system. 
3.  PVC pipe construction loads. To preclude damage to the pipe and disturbance to the embedment zone, a minimum depth of backfill should be maintained before allowing vehicles or heavy construction equipment to traverse the pipe trench. 
The minimum depth of cover should be established by the project engineer based on the specific project requirements. 
In the absence of such a detailed investigation, the installer shall meet the following minimum cover requirements before allowing vehicles or construction equipment to traffic the trench surface, assuming that the minimum embedment zone densities are prepared as per ASTM D2321: 
Provide minimum cover of at least twenty-four inches or one pipe diameter (whichever is larger) where Class I embedment materials have been utilized, or provide minimum cover of at least thirty-six inches or one pipe diameter (whichever is larger) where Class II or lower embedment materials have been utilized, and allow at least forty-eight inches of cover before using a hydrohammer for compaction directly over the pipe. Where construction loads may be excessive (e.g. cranes, earth moving equipment, etc.) consult with the project engineer to determine minimum operating cover requirements. 
4.  Gravel foundation for PVC pipe. The pipe foundation shall be a minimum of four inches in the compacted condition. Wherever the subgrade material does not afford a sufficiently solid foundation to support the pipe and superimposed load, it shall be excavated to such depth as may be necessary and replaced with crushed rock or gravel compacted into place. Gravel foundation material for pipe shall be placed only when, and to the depth, requested by the engineer or specified on the drawings. 
Gravel for PVC pipe foundations shall be clean crushed rock or gravel with one hundred percent passing a one-and-one-half-inch screen and maximum of five percent passing a three-fourths-inch sieve. 
5.  PVC pipe embedment. All pipe shall be protected from lateral displacement and possible damage resulting from impact or unbalanced loading during backfilling operations by being adequately bedded in suitable embedment material. The bottom of the trench shall be of stable materials. In general, coarse-grained soils, free of rocks and stones, such as graded crushed rock, gravel, sand, and other granular materials, are considered stable materials. A stable material shall be placed and compacted under the pipe haunches and up to the spring-line in uniform layers not exceeding eight inches in depth. When bedding is required, the same material should be used for both bedding and haunching. The same material shall be used to backfill the trench from the springline of the pipe to a point at least twelve inches above the top of the pipe. Each eight-inch layer of bedding, haunching and initial backfill shall be placed, then carefully and uniformly compacted to ninety-five percent of AASHTO T-180 (ASTM D-1557) density. Extra-fine sand, clay, silt, or large soil lumps shall not be allowed as bedding, haunching or initial backfill material. 
The remaining backfill over the top of the initial backfill shall be placed in accordance with Section 15.01.430. 
Modified bedding material shall be graded as follows: one hundred percent passing a one-and-one-half inch screen and five percent passing a No. 4 sieve.

Adequate foundation for all manhole structures shall be obtained by removal and replacement of unsuitable material with stabilization material; or by tightening with coarse ballast rock, or by such other means as provided for foundation preparation of the connected sewers, or as required by the city engineer. Where water is encountered at the site, all cast in place bases shall be placed on a one-piece waterproof membrane, so placed as to prevent any movement of the water into the fresh concrete. Precast base sections shall be placed on a well graded granular bedding course conforming to the requirements for sewer bedding but not less than eight inches in thickness and extending either to the limits of the excavation or to a minimum of twelve inches outside the outside limits of the base section. In the latter case, the balance of the excavated area shall be filled with select material well tamped to the level of the top of the bedding to positively prevent any lateral movement of the bedding when the weight of the manhole is placed upon it. The bedding coarse shall be firmly tamped and made smooth and level to assure uniform contact and support of the precast elements. 
C.  Bases. All manhole bases shall be pre-cast and shall have pipe inverts and a resilient connection between pipe and manhole for each pipe connecting to the manhole unless otherwise noted and approved by city engineer. The rubber gasket boot PSX Series Six, or approved equal, shall be installed outside of the manhole and shrink-proof grout pipe connection will be put on the inside of the manhole. Cast-in-place bases shall be at least nine inches in thickness and shall extend at least six inches radially outside of the outside dimension of the manhole section. Precast bases shall be a minimum of nine inches in thickness. Concrete bases shall be placed upon a minimum of six inches of compacted one-inch minus gravel. 
    The concrete base shall be constructed so the first section of the precast manhole has a uniform bearing throughout the full circumference of the manhole wall. Sufficient mortar shall be deposited on the concrete base to provide a water tight seal between the base and the manhole wall. Concrete used in the construction of the base shall conform to six and one-half bag, four thousand psi concrete as specified in the concrete section of these specifications. 
    Where sewer lines pass through or enter manholes, the invert channels shall be smooth and semi-circular in cross section conforming to the details shown on the drawing, incorporating a four-tenths-foot drop through the manhole. Changes of direction of flow within the manholes shall be made with a smooth curve with as long a radius as possible. The floor of the manhole outside the flow channels shall be made with a smooth curve with as long a radius as possible. The floor of the manhole outside the flow channels shall be smooth and slope toward the channel at not less than one inch per foot. 
    Concrete pipe connections to manholes shall be achieved by use of manhole coupling adapters, rubber gaskets (ASTM C923 specifications), positive seal gasket system, or grouting a bell or spigot pipe at the appropriate location. 
    Upon written approval of the City Engineer, connecting boots may be used consisting of neoprene compound meeting ASTM C-443 specifications. The boot shall have a wall thickness of three-eighths-inch. The boot shall either be "cast-in-place" in the precast base or attached to the precast base by means of an internal expanding band.

Sec. 15.01.620. - Cleaning and testing sanitary sewer lines. 
A.  Cleaning. After the sewer lines have been laid and the trench backfilled, they shall be thoroughly cleaned and tested for leakage and alignment in the presence of the city engineer or the city inspector before acceptance by the owner. Laterals and trunk lines shall be flushed by water to remove all foreign material. Wastewater and debris shall not be permitted to enter sewer lines in service, but shall be removed at the lowest manhole of the excavation. The scouring action shall be accomplished by hydraulic or jet cleaning. Other methods may be used upon approval of the city engineer. After the lines have been thoroughly cleaned, they shall be tested between all manholes for displacement. 
B.  Displacement test. The displacement test shall be supervised a conducted by the city engineer or the city inspector and shall consist of both of the following: (1) A light will be flashed between the manholes, or if the manholes have not as yet been constructed, between the locations of the manholes, by means of a flashlight or by reflecting sunlight with a mirror. If the illuminated interior of the pipe shows broken, misaligned or displaced pipe, or other defects, the defects designated by the city engineer shall be remedied by the contractor; (2) After sub base has been placed and compacted, prior to asphalt placement, the sewer line will be televised by the contractor. The contractor will supply and provide the city with a tape copy of the inspection along with a schematic plan identifying key locations on the video. The initial inspection shall be provided at no cost to the city. If the pipeline is found to be unacceptable, the problem shall be corrected by the contractor and re-televised. Television inspection must be scheduled at least one week in advance of date inspection is requested. 
C.  Exfiltration test. As required by the public works director or city engineer, each section of the sewer shall be tested between adjacent manholes by closing the lower end of the sewer to be tested and the inlet sewer of the upper manhole with stoppers. The pipe and manhole shall be filled with water to a point approximately four feet above the invert of the sewer at the center of the upper manhole or to four feet above the natural groundwater level, whichever is higher. All manhole and pipe sections shall also be required to pass an air test as described herein. 
    The maximum allowable exfiltration shall not exceed one hundred fifty gallons per inch diameter per mile per twenty-four hours for all installed sewer pipe. 
    A test may include an air pressure test at 4.0 PSI between adjacent manholes. 
    If the leakage from the sewer as shown by the test is in excess of the maximum allowable, the contractor will make the necessary corrections to reduce the exfiltration to within permissive limits. 
    Where the difference in elevation between inverts of adjacent manholes exceeds ten feet, the exfiltration leakage test will be modified as directed by the city engineer. 
    House surface laterals shall be considered part of the main line sewer to which they are connected and shall be tested with the main line sewer. 
D.  Infiltration test. In addition to the exfiltration test, the newly laid sewer system shall also comply with the following infiltration requirements. Infiltration tests shall be conducted by placing an approved calibrated V-notch weir in the line just above the next lower manhole and plugging the line just above the next higher manhole. Sufficient time shall be allowed for the water level behind the weir to stabilize before reading. Dislodge any foreign material obstructing the weir before reading. Take successive readings until consistent results are obtained. 
    Whenever the rate of infiltration is found to exceed the maximum, conduct electronic or photographic visual inspection of the interior of the pipeline. Make repairs and continue to test the conduit until it is within specified limits prior to proceeding with further construction. Make repairs at all manholes to exclude all infiltration occurring, whether or not they are within specified limits. 
    The maximum allowable infiltration for any section of the system shall be as follows, subject to the limitations described hereafter: 
I = 150 gallons/mile/inch/diameter/day. 
    Upon completion of all sectionalized testing, the total project infiltration of the newly constructed system shall be measured and recorded. This value shall be limited to one hundred twenty-five gallons/mile/inch/diameter/day. Make repairs and continue to test for total project infiltration until it is within this specified limit.

A.  "Go/No-Go" mandrel proof testing. Not less than thirty days after installation of the flexible sewer or drain pipe, the contractor shall test the buried pipe to insure that ring-deflection of the pipe does not exceed five percent of the pipe's specified minimum inside diameter (ID). This proof test shall establish that the contractor has installed the flexible pipe in full compliance with the project specifications thereby providing required pipe/soil structural strength. 
    The contractor, with inspector present, shall pull a "Go/No-Go" mandrel, inspected and approved by the engineer, through the full length of installed flexible pipe. The mandrel shall be fabricated from suitable metal with a minimum of nine properly sized radial fins mounted upon a center pulling shaft. In any case, the mandrel shall be provided with an odd number of rigidly mounted radial fins. The mandrel shall be provided with a proof-sizing ring that can demonstrate that the mandrel's minimum outside diameter (OD) is not less than ninety-five percent of the actual minimum inside diameter of the installed flexible pipe. The mandrel shall be pulled by the contractor through one hundred percent of the installed flexible pipe without using mechanical equipment. Failure of the mandrel to pass through a pipeline shall be deemed evidence of inadequate installation by the contractor not in compliance with the project specifications. 
    The engineer may require, if deemed appropriate or necessary, additional proof testing of designated lengths of the buried flexible pipe approximately one year after installation but prior to the expiration of the contractor's maintenance bond. The flexible pipeline shall be cleaned adequately prior to performing the "Go/No-Go" mandrel ring deflection proof test. The contractor, with inspector present, shall pull a mandrel, approved by the engineer, through the designated length of pipeline without using mechanical equipment. Failure of the mandrel to pass through the pipeline shall be deemed evidence of inadequate installation by the contractor not in compliance with the project specifications. If pipeline deflection exceeds five percent during proof testing, the pipeline shall be removed and replaced at the contractor's expense.

Sec. 15.01.780. - Culinary water line construction near sewer or wastewater lines. 
(Applicable public health department criteria) 
A.  Water/sewer line horizontal separation. A culinary water main must be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed sewer or wastewater leach line. Separation distances shall be measured pipe edge to pipe edge. 
    Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten feet, a culinary water main may be laid closer than ten feet to sewer lines (but not leach lines) provided: 
1.  The main is laid in a separate trench; or 
2.  The main is laid on an undisturbed earth shelf on one side of the sewer line trench; or 
3.  The main is laid in a sewer or drain line trench which has been backfilled and compacted not less than ninety-five percent of maximum laboratory density. (The density shall be determined in accordance with the procedures given by ASTM Standard D-690). 
    In each of the above cases, the bottom of the culinary water line shall be at least 18 inches above the top of the sewer line. At the same time, the culinary water line must be sufficiently buried to prevent freezing. 
B.  Exception to horizontal separation. When it is impossible to obtain the proper horizontal and vertical separation as stipulated above, both the water main and sewer line shall be constructed of cast iron, ductile iron, galvanized steel or protected steel pipe having mechanical joints. Other types of joints of equal or greater integrity may be used at the discretion of the city engineer. Thermoplastic pipe may be used provided mechanical or solvent weld pipe joints are used. These lines shall be pressure-tested to assure water tightness before backfilling. 
C.  Culinary water/sewer line crossings. Whenever culinary water mains must cross sanitary sewers, the water main shall be laid at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is eighteen inches above the top of the sewer. This vertical separation should be maintained for the portion of the water main located within ten feet horizontally of any sewer it crosses. The ten feet is to be measured as the perpendicular distance from the sewer line to the water line. 
D.  Inability to provide vertical separation. Where conditions prevent the minimum vertical separation as set forth above from being maintained, or when it is necessary for the culinary water main to pass under a sewer, both the culinary water main and the sewer line shall be constructed of cast iron, ductile iron, galvanized steel or protected steel pipe, having mechanical joints. Thermoplastic pipe may be used provided mechanical or solvent weld type joints are used. The mechanical joint pipe shall extend on each side of the crossing until the perpendicular distance from the sewer line to the culinary water line is at least ten feet. In making such crossings, it is preferable to center a length of culinary water main so that the joints will be equidistant from the sewer and as remote there from as possible. 
    Where a culinary water main must cross under a sewer, a vertical separation of at least eighteen inches between the bottom of the sewer and the top of the culinary water main shall be maintained with adequate support for the larger sized sewer lines to prevent them from settling on and breaking the culinary water main. 
    In the case where a new culinary water line must be routed under an existing sewer line, and it is desired not to disturb the sewer line, the city engineer may grant an exception to the above requirements. The designer must then propose a method for protecting the culinary line. Such a proposal must be deemed acceptable in writing by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2007-07-31, §§ 9.8-9.8.4, 7-10-2007; Ord. No. 2010-11-24, § 2, 11-23-2010)

    Lines shall be slowly filled with water venting off all air. If required, taps shall be provided at line high points to bleed off the air and after testing these shall be plugged. A minimum pressure fifty percent in excess of the maximum line operating pressure shall be maintained on the portion being tested for a minimum period of two hours, using hydraulic means to maintain the pressure. Maximum leakage during the test shall not exceed one-half gallon per inch of diameter per one thousand feet of pipe. Suitable means shall be provided by the contractor for determining the quantity of water lost by leakage under the test pressure. No pipe installation will be accepted until the leakage is less than the allowable. 
C.  Flushing. After pressure testing all pipelines shall be flushed. Flushing shall be accomplished through hydrants or, if a hydrant does not exist at the end of the line, the contractor shall install a tap of sufficient size to provide for a two and one-half foot per second flushing velocity in the line. The following is the flow quantity required to provide a two and one-half foot per second flushing velocity:

DIVISION 17. - RECOMMENDED ACCESS MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS[1] 

Footnotes:

The Access Management Manual can be found at http://afcity.org/719/Engineering 

Sec. 15.01.1830. - Introduction. 
    The following sections discuss recommended access management related standards for American Fork City. These recommendations are based on national and local research, as well as the current state-of-the-practice by other DOTs and municipalities. 
(Ord. No. 2012-05-15, § 2, 5-8-2012) 
_____
Sec. 15.01.1840. - Access provisions. 
    This section discusses what types of accesses should be permitted on the various types of roadways within American Fork. The roadway network and land use are interconnected, therefore allowing certain types of land use and accesses adjacent to certain types of roadways will lead to the correct type of access and mobility that would be expected for a certain type of road. Table 1 shows recommended allowable accesses for each roadway classification. 
Table 1. Access Provisions 
Street 
Classification Commercial 
Access Multi-Family 
Residential 
Access Residential 
Access Public Street 
Access Arterial street Yes 1 No 3 No Yes Major collector Yes Yes No 5 Yes Minor collector Yes Yes Yes 4 Yes Local street No 2 Yes Yes Yes Notes: 1. Preferably, commercial access to an arterial should be consolidated for several parcels and gained using a traffic signal or a public street. Where direct access is given to an arterial, if possible, the access should be a RIRO access. 2. Exceptions to this recommendation would be for small commercial developments or for secondary access to a development. 3. Very large multi-family developments may have private accesses that resemble public streets in form and function, and therefore would be an exception to this recommendation. 4. Direct access and frontage of residential properties to a minor collector may result in less-than-desirable livability for residents and should be avoided where practical. 5. Direct access and frontage of residential properties to a major collector may result in less-than-desirable livability for residents and should be avoided where practical; however, if base residential zoning allows access, then a traffic impact study showing acceptable operations and safety can be mitigated, then an engineering review will determine the applicability of this standard.  
    Recommendations listed in Table 1 may not always be feasible depending on whether or not other access exists for a given parcel of land. The feasibility of these recommendations is also highly dependent upon land use and transportation planning for American Fork City. 
(Ord. No. 2012-05-15, § 2, 5-8-2012) 
Sec. 15.01.1850. - Intersection and access spacing. 
    Based on recommendations from the literature and from state-of-the-practice of other municipalities and DOTs, recommendations for minimum signalized, public street and private access spacing have been compiled and are shown in Table 2.

_____
Sec. 15.01.1860. - Corner clearance requirements. 
    The corner clearance requirements are the same as the minimum access spacing requirements as were shown previously in Table 2. In general, minimum corner clearance can be shorter on the downstream leg of the minor street at an intersection, especially if the access is s RIRO access. This distance can be as low as one hundred twenty feet. For all other corner clearance distances, the values in Table 2 for minimum access spacing apply. 
(Ord. No. 2012-05-15, § 2, 5-8-2012) 
Sec. 15.01.1870. - Cross access (shared access) requirements. 
    Access to private property from the public transportation network cannot be prohibited. However, when parcels have small frontages, especially along major collectors and arterials, it is highly recommended that the cross access and/or shared access be utilized where practical. Where adjoining parcels have the same ownership, American Fork City should require the use of cross or shared access in order to maintain the recommended access spacing requirements as previously discussed. When adjacent parcels do not have common ownership, incentives should be provided to promote shared and cross access. 
(Ord. No. 2012-05-15, § 2, 5-8-2012) 
Sec. 15.01.1880. - Intersection alignment/offsets. 
    Where possible, accesses on opposite sides of the street should be lined up directly across from each other. Sometimes this is not possible due to site restrictions or property lines. If accesses cannot be lined up across from one another, the preferable offset is so that left turns entering each respective access do not overlap. Table 3 shows the minimum offset for intersections on opposite sides of the street when the potential for overlap does occur. However, a traffic impact study may determine that a larger offset is required depending on the level of queuing that may occur at the intersections. 
Table 3. Minimum Access Offset Requirements 
Street Classification Minimum Offset (feet) 1 Arterial street 2 310 Major collector 180 Minor collector 120 Local street n/a Notes: 1. These values are a minimum requirement and are subject to change based on the results of a traffic impact study. 2. Offset requirements are not applicable in the case of RIRO accesses such as when a raised median is present. Access should only be provided to arterial streets when reasonable alternative access is does not exist.

Sec. 15.01.1890. - On-street parking. 
    Permitting on-street parking can be a tool to make a corridor more pedestrian friendly as parked vehicles provide a buffer between through traffic and pedestrians on the sidewalks. Vehicles parking and un-parking along a roadway may cause side friction that can result in through traffic being slowed down or impeded. To determine whether or not a road should have permitted on-street parking depends primarily on what the function of the roadway is. As was discussed previously, the purpose of most arterial type roads is to provide mobility, not access, whereas the purpose of a local street is to provide access and not mobility. However, another important factor is adjacent land use. A roadway in a core business area, even if classified as an arterial, can benefit from having on-street parking, where a lower classified road, such as a minor collector within an industrial area, may not need on-street parking, therefore the cost to build and maintain this type of road will be less expensive by prohibiting on-street parking. Finally, the available cross section width should also be considered when determining whether on-street parking should be permitted. A minimum of seven feet of cross section width should be provided for on-street parking. Table 4 shows recommended on-street parking provisions based on functional classification. Figure 1 shows on-street parking on Main Street in American Fork. Although this road is classified as an arterial, the adjacent land use supports on-street parking. All parking within American Fork City should be parallel except for Church Street, Center Street and Merchant Street between Main Street and Pacific Drive and Main Street from 200 East to 460 East.

These recommendations are based primarily on the function of the roadway. Adjacent land use and available cross section width are also important factors in determining whether on-street parking should be permitted.

_____
Sec. 15.01.1900. - Access characteristics. 
    Recommendations for access characteristics discussed in this section include the following: 
  Driveway width 
  Curb return radii 
  Vertical profile of driveway 
  Driveway throat length 
  Minimum separation of gate on private access from public street 
    All recommendations in this section assume the following: 
  The design vehicle for residential and commercial accesses is a passenger car 
  The design vehicle for industrial accesses is a WB-50, with the exception of the North Pointe Business Park including the Price property, which will be designated by the city engineer based on the type of anticipated vehicle usage. 
    Although some larger vehicles such as delivery vehicles do need access to commercial areas, these types of trips do not typically occur during the peak periods of the day. The entire access (ingress and egress side) can therefore be used by a larger vehicle during off-peak times. This is more efficient than utilizing more area to make larger radii and access widths and is also more ideal for pedestrians. Access driveways that will be heavily utilized by trucks and busses during peak periods should be designed to the industrial recommendations. 
    Table 5 shows driveway widths and curb radii for various intersection types depending on the functional classification of the adjacent roadway.

    Table 6 shows the required curb radius measured from top back of curb (TBC) for the various street intersections within American Fork City. Deviation from these standards requires approval in writing from the city engineer.

    Table 7 contains maximum change in grade between the cross-slope of the roadway and the slope of the driveway. The maximum change in grade reported is the algebraic difference in slope. For example, if a negative two percent cross-slope connects to a positive two percent driveway slope, the algebraic change in grade is four percent. Likewise, if the cross-slope is negative two percent and the driveway slope is negative six percent, the algebraic change in grade is also four percent. Table 6 also shows the maximum change in grade where no vertical curves are required (rounding only) as well as the maximum change in grade with vertical curves provided. 
    Table 8 shows the recommended driveway throat lengths for various access types and based on what type of conflict is closest to the adjacent road. When an internal intersection will be the first conflict encountered when entering a driveway, a shorter throat is typically needed then for a site where the driver will encounter parking spots after entering the access. 
    Table 9 shows the minimum separation of a gate on a private access from the edge of traveled way for various design vehicles. This separation is necessary so that a vehicle can park in front of the gate while it is still closed without the rear of the vehicle obstructing the flow of traffic. Where the possibility of queuing exists, such as at a gated residential community, a traffic study should be completed to determine the 95th percentile queue length during the peak hour.

Sec. 15.01.1910. - Intersection sight distance. 
    This section discusses recommended intersection sight distance for several intersection types and is based on AASHTO Greenbook (2004) recommendations. These recommendations are made for various intersection control scenarios as well as functional classifications of the intersecting roads. Additionally, sight distances to accommodate trucks have also been calculated. Scenarios discussed in the following sections include intersection sight distance for a full access stop-controlled intersection, a RIRO access, a yield-control intersection (four-leg and three-leg intersection), and an uncontrolled intersection. Sight distance requirements for a left turn from a major street onto a minor street are also given within the provided tables for illustrative purposes. All intersection sight distances should be calculated by a licensed traffic engineer and compared to the tables within this division. 
    For all of the scenarios, the following assumptions have been made: 
(1)  Design speeds: 
  Access: Fifteen mph. 
  Local: Thirty mph. 
  Minor collector: Thirty-five mph. 
  Major collector: Forty mph. 
  Arterial: Fifty mph. 
(2)  Intersections are flat (all slopes are assumed three percent or less). 
(3)  Cross sections: 
  Local: Two lanes. 
  Minor collector: Two lanes. 
  Major collector: Three lanes. 
  Arterial: Five lanes. 
(4)  All calculations are based on AASHTO Greenbook (2004) assumptions. 
    Because the grade of the major or minor street does affect sight distance, the values presented in the sections below should be adjusted when grades are more than three percent. These adjustments should be made on an individual case-case basis by consulting the AASHTO Greenbook. Additionally, alternative design speeds or cross sections will also require adjustments to these sight distances. 
    Once intersection sight distances have been determined for a given intersection, a "clear sight triangle" can be formed which should remain clear of anything that will obstruct the driver from seeing other vehicles within the intersection sight distance. The AASHTO Greenbook states that the minimum height of a driver's eye is approximately 3.5 feet. The maximum height (which corresponds to the driver of a combination or single unit truck) is approximately 7.6 feet. Therefore, objects should not be placed in the clear sight triangle between 3.5 and 7.6 feet in height. Objects such as buildings, fences, and parked cars are examples of objects that will block the intersection sight distance. Landscaping features such as shrubbery and decorative rocks are acceptable as long as they are less than 3.5 feet high. Trees are acceptable as long as the stump is located outside of the clear sight triangle and the lowest branches are at least 7.6 feet tall. These height standards apply to areas with flat grade. Intersections near slopes must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
A.  Stop-controlled intersections. Intersection site distances for stop-controlled intersections include full movement intersections where the minor street is stop-controlled, but the major street does not stop. RIRO intersection sight distance is also presented. Table 10 shows the sight distance required for full-movement intersections. Table 11 shows the sight distance required for RIRO intersections. In both cases, the sight triangle for the minor leg should be twenty feet back from the edge of traveled way of the major street. The value shown in the table is how far to the left and right for which the stopped vehicle should have a clear sight triangle. Figure 2 illustrates these distances and the sight triangle.

Figure 2. Intersection sight triangles for stop-controlled minor approaches.
B.  Yield-controlled intersections. Intersection site distances for yield-controlled intersections include four-leg intersections where both minor street approaches are yield control as well as three-leg intersections where the minor street is yield-controlled. In both scenarios, the major street does not stop. Other combinations of yield approaches must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Table 12 shows the sight distance required at four-way intersections with minor-street yield control. Table 13 shows the sight distance required at T-intersections with one yield-controlled leg. For the T-intersection scenario (Table 13), the site distance on the minor street is measured eighty-two feet back from the traveled way of the minor street approach. Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate these distances and the sight triangles for four-way and T-intersections, respectively. Sight distance values were only calculated for passenger cars as it is assumed that roads with significant truck traffic will not be yield-controlled intersections. Also, it was assumed that the major streets do not have classifications higher than minor collector, as these types of high classification streets should at least have stop control on the minor street.

C.  Uncontrolled intersections. Uncontrolled intersection site distances are for those intersections where neither the minor nor the major street has any control. These streets are typically very low volume roads primarily in residential subdivisions. Table 14 shows the sight distance required at uncontrolled intersections. Only access roads and local streets were shown as any other higher classification road should have some intersection control. The distance shown in the table corresponds to the site leg of the site distance triangle for the respective type of road. Figure 5 illustrates the site distance triangle for this type of intersection. Sight distance values were only calculated for passenger cars as it is assumed that roads with significant truck traffic will not be yield-controlled intersections.

D.  Left turns from the major road. Intersection sight distance for left turns from the major road include any left turn movement where the driver must yield to oncoming traffic (through and right turning vehicles) before turning left onto the minor street.

For purposes of these recommendations, commercial accesses also include multi-family developments. 2. However, if this affects the project or the local subdivision negatively, then and appeals process can be initiated.  
    In addition to intersection lighting, street lighting should also be provided, especially when roads are curved, or other design features make safely traveling the road at night more difficult without lighting. The type and frequency of lighting should be based on the context of the street including adjacent land use, architectural styles, and pedestrian usage. Making general recommendations for street lighting is beyond the scope of an access management plan. However, for reference in commercial areas street lights should be installed at one-hundred-fifty-foot intervals on opposite sides of the road and in residential areas at three-hundred-foot intervals on opposite sides of the road. Street lights should be installed at corners with at least one on every block. Mid-block street lighting is required if block lengths exceed five hundred feet. Street lights should be installed on opposite corner from stop signs unless otherwise determined by the city engineer. Figure 7 shows street lighting in a portion of the downtown core area that adds to the character of the street because of its aesthetics and pedestrian scale. 

Figure 7. Street lighting such as this add to the character of the street and adds more to pedestrian safety than to traffic operations.

CHAPTER 15.16 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 15.16.010. - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 89-08-08, § 1.2, 1989) 
Sec. 15.16.020. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaking at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
G.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and, 
H.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 89-08-08, § 1.3, 1989) 
Sec. 15.16.030. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 89-08-08, § 1.4, 1989) 
Sec. 15.16.040. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
A.  Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
B.  Base flood means the flood having a one percent change of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
C.  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling, operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
D.  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
E.  Flood Insurance Range Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated areas of special flood hazard designated as zone A. 
F.  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance. 
G.  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
H.  Structure means a walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is principally above ground. 
I.  Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either: 
1.  Before the improvement or repair is started, or 
2.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structures. 
The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
2.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
(Ord. No. 89-08-08, § 2, 1989)

Sec. 15.24.060. - Qualification criteria. 
    To qualify for reimbursement a development project shall conform with the following: 
1.  In order for the city council to determine that any proposed agreement to provide reimbursement payments is entered into in good faith and for adequate consideration to the city that provides a clear present benefit that reflects fair market value, it must be shown that the city will receive fair market value in exchange for the reimbursement payments provided. In a multi-year transaction, that determination must be made for each year independent of every other year. It is not enough to show that the entire agreement provides such a fair exchange of value. Neither a future benefit nor a benefit that is of uncertain value will be sufficient for these purposes. Furthermore, a mere shift in tax revenue sources from one part of the city to another cannot be counted as providing a net benefit to the city. It must be established that additional property tax revenues, sales tax revenues, or other tangible and quantifiable benefits will be received by the city as a result of any development project for which payment of reimbursement is proposed under the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  The development is located in a commercial, professional office or industrial zone as set forth on the official zone map of the city; and 
3.  Either: 
A.  The proposed project includes the redevelopment or improvement of an existing retail, office or manufacturing activity, regardless of size, which has existed in the city for a period of ten years or longer; or 
B.  The project consists of a single development project containing one or more new establishments which conform to all of the following: 
1)  The project consists entirely of buildings and areas housing retail, office or manufacturing activities; and 
2)  The project area contains not less than ten acres; and 
3)  The activities within the project will provide a significant increase in sales tax revenues and property tax revenues to the city and/or provide significant increase in job opportunities.

17.1.400 - CONVEYANCE OF WATER 
    Wherever the terms of this code require the conveyance of water, such conveyance shall conform to the terms of this section. 
A.  Amount of water right required . The amount (number of acre-feet) of water required to be conveyed to the city as part of a request for approval of an annexation, subdivision, large scale development, site plan, or building permit shall be the amount considered sufficient to meet the water use requirements of the proposed use, to be determined in accordance with the following: 
1.  Residential uses . 
a.  Indoor uses . Indoor residential requirements shall be based on an Equivalent Residential Connection (ERC) basis as shown in the table in c. below. Each ERC shall be required to convey 0.45 acre-feet of water right for indoor use. 
b.  Outdoor uses . Outdoor residential requirements shall be based on acreage as shown in the table in c. below. For single-family units and two-family units, requirements shall be based on total gross lot acreage. For multi-family units, requirements shall be based on irrigated acreage. 
c.  Water rights requirements are set forth in the following table: 
Residential Development Culinary Uses Irrigation Uses Equivalent Residential 
Connections (ERC) Acre-Feet Required 
(ERC X 0.45) Acre-Feet Required Single-Family Unit 1.00 0.45 1.80 acre-feet per acre of lot Two-Family Unit 2.00 0.90 1.80 acre-feet per acre of lot Multifamily Units: Number of Bedrooms One 0.42 0.19 3.60 acre-feet per irrigated acre Two 0.83 0.37 Three 1.11 0.50 Four or more 1.39 0.63 All other metered culinary uses. An amount sufficient to meet the projected needs of the proposed development based on an evaluation of demand characteristics for similar uses as determined by the city.  
2.  Residential-agricultural projects (one acre or larger lots) . Same as (1.) above, except that where there is adequate data to show that the agricultural use requirements will be met using other sources (i.e., a private well or irrigation shares), the city may delay the time of conveyance of the portion devoted to irrigation of agricultural lands until the occurrence of one of the following: (1) the source of water used for irrigation of agricultural lands is from the city's culinary or secondary water system, or (2) the area used for agricultural purposes is proposed to be converted to residential or other urban purpose. 
3.  Commercial, Industrial, institutional, and all other non-residential uses shall be required to convey water rights per the following table: 
Non-residential Development Culinary Uses Irrigation Uses Acre-Feet Required Acre-Feet Required Commercial, industrial, institutional, and all other non-residential uses An amount sufficient to meet the projected needs of the proposed development based on an evaluation of demand characteristics for similar uses as determined by the city. 3.60 acre-feet per irrigated acre  
4.  Exceptions and adjustments to required amounts . 
a.  Where, because of topographic conditions or other factors, some portion of the lands are permanently restricted from any use or activity requiring water, the city may reduce the amount of water required. Any request for reduction shall include enforceable provisions for ensuring the restricted condition. 
b.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this code, no water will be required for any existing dwelling within the city not previously connected to the city water system, any existing dwelling which has been previously connected to the city's culinary water system, or any existing one-family dwelling which is subsequently annexed to the city and connected to the city water system. 
c.  Subsequent to a determination of water requirement, if the use of an existing non-residential facility or development is modified and results in an increased use of water, an additional amount of water sufficient to meet the projected needs of the modified use shall be required to be conveyed to the city. 
B.  Type of water considered acceptable by the city . The city council does hereby establish that the preferred type of water acceptable to the city shall be stock in an irrigation company capable of delivering water through the city's water system and used within the city. The specific irrigation company water stock considered acceptable for conveyance to the city and the quantity allowable for each shall be as follows: 
1.  Irrigation water stock . Transfer of title will be by delivery of a stock certificate(s), in the name of American Fork City, from one or a combination of the following irrigation companies: 
a.  American Fork Irrigation Company: 0.50 shares per acre-foot which equates to two acre-feet per share. 
b.  Provo Reservoir Water Users Company (PRWUCo) : 
1.  Alpine District Full Shares: 0.20 shares per acre-foot which equates to five acre-feet per share. 
2.  Alpine District Full contained Shares: 2.0 shares per acre-foot which equates to 0.5 acre-feet per share. 
3.  Alpine District Late Shares: 0.40 shares per acre-foot which equates to 2.5 acre-feet per share. 
4.  Alpine District Late contained Shares: 4.0 shares per acre-foot which equates to 0.25 acre-feet per share. 
c.  Other Murdock Canal irrigation shares that are deliverable through the established turnout points capable of delivering water through the city's water system and used within American Fork City, including Highland Conservation District and PRWUA deliverable shares at 1.0 acre-foot per full share or 0.1 acre-foot per conserved share. 
d.  Other irrigation stock including Mitchell Hollow, Mitchell Springs, Provo Bench, North Union, or other applicable Surface Irrigation: (quantity as determined by the terms of an approved change application and by conveyance agreement with the city). Any such right will have a source and delivery system capable of delivering water through the city's water system and used within American Fork City. 
e.  Conveyance costs or annual fees associated with irrigation shares identified in sections b, c, and d above, shall be assessed a fee to cover perpetual charges. 
2.  Groundwater rights . The city, at the sole discretion of the city council, may accept title to water rights from a well or other groundwater source. Transfer of title of rights from a well right or other groundwater source, when approved by the city, shall be by warranty deed authorizing the diversion of a specific quantity of water in acre-feet and shall be subject to the following: 
a.  The dedicator must file an application for dedication of water to American Fork City; pay the applicable fee, as set by the city council; and comply with all requirements of the application, including payment or reimbursement of all costs associated with the water dedication (including but not limited to attorney fees, water application filing fees, recording fees, and title insurance premiums). 
b.  The city shall have given prior approval indicating its willingness to accept the water right proposed for conveyance. 
c.  A change application for the water right proposed for conveyance signed by both the applicant and the city, shall have been submitted to the Utah Division of Water Rights and a decision rendered that approves the diversion of the water right through the city's points of diversion for municipal use in the city and that is acceptable to the city. 
d.  Any wells or other points of diversion on the property must be permanently abandoned according to the requirements of the Utah Division of Water Rights, or (at the sole discretion of the city) conveyed to the city. 
e.  Prior to acceptance of a water right by the city, the water right must have a water right title policy issued on it that is clean and approved by the city. 
3.  City to approve proposed conveyance . Prior to acceptance of a water share or a water right the city shall evaluate the water share or water right proposed for conveyance and may refuse to accept any share or right which it believes to be insufficient in amount or flow or otherwise unsuitable for use by the city. 
C.  Time of conveyance . Actual conveyance of the water shall be as follows: 
1.  For annexations . For all parcels signatory to the request for annexation, the conveyance of title to water shares and/or water rights shall occur concurrently with final action on the annexation by the city council. Provided, however, where, because a proposed annexation is large, or the proposed zone classification is for agricultural or other non-urban purpose, or there exist other conditions, deemed sufficient by the city, which prohibit actual conveyance of the water right at the time of annexation, the city council may authorize a delay in the time of conveyance of the water shares and/or water rights to a time following completion of annexation proceedings. Any proposal to delay the actual time of conveyance shall be subject to the following findings and conditions: 
a.  The council, with the recommendation of the planning commission, determines that there is good and sufficient reason to delay the time of conveyance. 
b.  The specific water shares and/or water rights proposed to be delayed are clearly identified. 
c.  There is adequate assurance that the water shares and/or water rights proposed for conveyance in the future are irrevocably committed to the city through placement of the shares and/or rights in a third party escrow arrangement and/or execution of a water transfer agreement. The documentation establishing the terms of delay shall be established prior to the action to annex and shall include the following: (i) the timing and/or condition for actual conveyance are clearly stipulated in the agreement, (ii) in the instance of water rights, an application seeking approval of a change to municipal use shall have been filed with the Utah State Engineer, (iii) there are no encumbrances on said shares and/or rights which may prohibit their subsequent conveyance without cost to the city, (iv) no development which requires the delivery of water shall be approved for the parcel until actual conveyance has occurred. 
2.  For subdivision and large scale development projects. 
a.  Water shares and/or water rights, in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements for the proposed subdivision, large scale development or similar development project shall be conveyed concurrently with the action granting approval of a final plat of a project, approval of a site plan, or similar action which has the effect of authorizing a building permit or permission to commence construction of a project.

2.  Discourage development in areas deemed hazardous. 
3.  Provide compensation to the owners of property from which development rights are transferred. 
4.  Provide a method whereby development rights may be transferred from sending sites to receiving sites in order to accomplish the purposes set forth in subsections 1., 2. and 3. above. 
B.  Applicability. The procedures and requirements of this chapter shall apply to the creation and transfer of development rights from sending sites to receiving sites within the city. 
C.  TDR overlay zone established; sending and receiving sub-zones delineated. 
1.  The parcels of real property which may be preserved and protected by the transfer of development rights from such parcels are those located within a designated sending area. Those parcels of real property which are suitable for using development rights transferred from sending sites are those parcels located within a designated receiving area. 
2.  To more adequately implement the objectives of the zone and facilitate the administration thereof, there is hereby adopted a transfer of development rights eligibility map (TDR eligibility map), which map shall constitute an overlay zone within the city. The boundaries of the TDR eligibility map may be amended from time to time. 
3.  The TDR eligibility map is further delineated into two sub zones, as follows: 
a.  TDR-sending area sub-zone. The specific areas within the city eligible for designation as a development rights sending site shall be those areas shown on the TDR eligibility map and designated as TDR-S. 
b.  TDR-receiving area sub-zone. The specific areas within the city eligible for designation as a development rights receiving site shall be those areas shown on the TDR eligibility map and designated as TDR-R. 
D.  Transferable development rights; creation of sending sites. 
1.  In order to be eligible to transfer one or more development rights from a parcel of property (sending site), such property shall be located within a TDR-S sub-zone, as shown on the TDR eligibility map. An area may be designated as a TDR-S sub-zone by action of the city or upon request of the owner of such property, pursuant to rezoning procedures set forth in Title VI of this code. 
2.  The number of development rights attached to a particular sending site shall be determined and transferred by applying the following rules: 
a.  Within the SP shoreline preservation zone, the total number of development rights which may be created for a sending site shall be one dwelling unit for each five acres. This shall be construed as the base density for the SP shoreline preservation zone. 
b.  Within all zones except the SP shoreline preservation zone: 
(i)  The total number of development rights which may be created for a sending site shall be equal to one-half of the site's base zone density, as established pursuant to the terms of the underlying zone. 
(ii)  The number of development rights to be transferred at any one time may be determined by the sending site owner, so long as the total number of rights transferred does not exceed the total number of development rights associated with the sending site. 
3.  The number of development rights applicable to a sending site shall be as determined by the city, in accordance with the criteria set forth under subsection 2. above. A certificate showing the number of development rights appurtenant to a sending site shall be issued by the city, subject to the prior request of the owner. 
4.  Development rights shall be created and transferred only by means of documents, including a conservation easement, which meet the requirements of this section. No transferable development rights certificate shall be issued, and no development rights shall be transferred, unless and until a conservation easement is recorded among the land records of Utah County, Utah, on the property from which such development rights originate. 
5.  The transfer of any development rights from a sending site shall be evidenced by a notice recorded among the land records of Utah County, Utah, in a form approved by the city council, after receiving a recommendation from the planning commission. Such notice shall indicate; 
a.  The total number of development rights which may be transferred from the sending site; 
b.  The number of development rights actually transferred at the time the notice is recorded; 
c.  The number of development rights remaining; and 
d.  Notice to any potential buyer of the sending site that: (i) some or all of the development rights appurtenant to the parcel may have been transferred from the property; and (ii) the buyer should contact American Fork City officials to determine the number of development rights, if any, remaining on the sending site. 
6.  Upon completion of action to transfer some or all of the development rights from a parcel within the TDR-S sub-zone: 
a.  A copy of the TDR eligibility map (or such other map as the city may maintain for that purpose) shall be prepared showing the boundary of the sending site, with an indication that the parcel(s) therein constitute a site from which some or all of the development rights have been transferred.

The placement of the lot lines shall give consideration to the important site features, and shall conform to the natural features of the landscape to the greatest extent possible, e.g., lines of boundary trees, streams, habitat areas, etc. 
3.  Site plan standards. 
a.  All development shall, whenever possible, preserve important site features in their natural condition. The planning commission and/or city council may request an advisory opinion from the Utah Lake Commission to assist in determining the value of the natural features on a site, the boundaries of those natural systems, and the relative importance of preserving the integrity and function of the natural resources present on the site. 
b.  To the extent practical, the boundaries of site features should be contiguous within the parcel and adjacent to existing undeveloped land on adjoining parcels to form a continuous, integrated natural system. Particular attention shall be paid to maintaining and expanding existing or planned natural resource areas and trail networks. 
c.  Access points to designated public trails and open areas shall be clearly identified on plans and posted with permanent signage approved by the planning commission and/or city council. 
d.  Site features should be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot configuration rather than malleable elements that can be changed to allow for a preferred development scheme. 
e.  Significant trees, boundary trees, wetlands, streams, and other important site features should be incorporated along the edges of individual lots or along a path or roadway, rather than transected by lot lines or a roadway. 
f.  The planning commission and/or city council may require a setback from the edge of the designated natural features depending on the type of natural resource and its characteristics. 
g.  The planning commission and/or city council shall determine if fencing is necessary to protect the functions and values of the site features. 
4.  Phasing plan. 
a.  When a development will not utilize the entire parcel and there is potential for future development of the parcel, the application for preliminary review shall include a phasing plan showing the potential future utilization and interim management plans for the balance of the parcel not being developed. 
b.  The phasing plan is a sketch plan with no engineering details, intended to be conceptual in nature, and to demonstrate that the current development proposal will not compromise important conservation values or the long term development of the parcel. 
c.  This plan shall show the relationship of the proposed development area to the balance of the parcel and to adjacent land. This plan shall analyze the conservation and development potential of the remaining area of the parcel and shall show, in general terms, the potential street network, open space areas, and development areas in a manner that demonstrates that both the proposed development and the future development can occur so that it conforms to the requirements herein and preserves the significant natural resource values of the entire parcel. 
H.  Design standards. The following design standards are intended to improve the character and aesthetic qualities of developments in the shoreline protection overlay zone, and to minimize impacts on important natural and other site features. Variations from these standards may be granted by the planning commission and/or city council provided that the overall intent of this section is achieved by the alternative design. 
1.  Building sites. 
a.  The location and orientation of building sites shall be designed to maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns, to preserve important natural features in their natural condition, to minimize disturbance of natural vegetated cover, and to minimize grading, cut-and-fill, and soil removal to minimize negative impacts on the natural resources of the site as identified by the site features map and/or site inventory. 
b.  All building construction must comply with the floodplain regulations of American Fork City. 
c.  A building envelope shall be identified for each site, where appropriate. Future construction shall be limited to the identified building envelopes. Building envelopes should be set back as far as possible from significant site features, consistent with other design parameters of this section, to augment and protect the integrity of natural site features. 
d.  Buildings should be grouped into clusters, which should be located to minimize negative impacts on the natural resources of the site and conflicts between incompatible uses. 
e.  Building envelopes shall, to the extent possible, conform to the natural contours of the site and be delineated to minimize negative impacts on the natural resources of the site, as identified by the site features map and/or site inventory. 
f.  If agricultural uses are being maintained, buildings shall be configured in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural uses. 
2.  Disturbance/alterations. 
a.  Alterations to identified significant natural site features shall only be permitted to address public safety issues as determined by the city. 
b.  No topsoil or vegetation shall be removed from designated open spaces unless needed to address a public safety issue as determined by the city.

I.  Ownership of open lands. The ownership and responsibility for maintenance of the required buffer area and other areas left undeveloped to protect natural resources and avoid hazards should be decided on a case-by-case basis. In general, areas planned to be open for use by the general public should be in public ownership, but other arrangements may be appropriate. Options for ownership and maintenance include: 
1.  Public ownership. American Fork City may, but is not be required to, accept any portion or portions of a buffer or open land, provided that: 
a.  The land shall be freely accessible to the public; 
b.  The city agrees to and has access to maintain such lands; 
c.  The land is in an acceptable condition to the city at the time of transfer with regard to size, shape, location, and improvement; and 
d.  The developer or property owner provides funding for at least one year of maintenance as identified in the maintenance plan. 
2.  Undivided ownership. Unless otherwise approved by the city, the underlying fee ownership of the land may remain in single ownership and may be owned and maintained by one of the following entities: land trust, conservation organization, governmental entity, or private individual. 
3.  Owners' association. Land may be held in common ownership by an owners' association, subject to all of the provisions for owners' associations set forth in state regulations and the city's subdivision regulations. In addition, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  A description of the organization of the proposed association, including its bylaws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for natural resource land, shall be submitted by the developer with the final plat/site plan application. 
b.  The association shall be responsible for maintenance and insurance of the natural resource land. 
c.  Written notice of any proposed transfer of natural resource land by the association or the assumption of maintenance for the natural resource land must be given to all members of the association and to the city no less than thirty days prior to such event. 
d.  The association shall have adequate staff to administer, maintain, and operate such natural resource land. 
e.  At the discretion of the planning commission and/or city council, an applicant may be required to prepare a brochure detailing the location and use restrictions of the designated open space, and provided to all purchasers of property within the subdivision. 
J.  Maintenance of open lands. In general, the responsibility for maintenance of required buffer areas and lands left open to protect natural resources and avoid hazards should lie with the owner(s) of the land. The following provisions should be addressed in a maintenance plan agreement that accompanies the final development approval that results in the creation of open lands: 
1.  Area boundaries. Area boundaries of the designated open lands shall be clearly identified: 
a.  Boundaries shall be clearly delineated on plans including plats. 
b.  Boundaries shall be clearly marked and identified as "No Disturbance" areas, except in areas identified for permitted uses, prior to commencing construction activities, including tree cutting, site clearing and grading; temporary markings are acceptable.

Such funding plan shall include the means for funding long-term capital improvements as well as regular yearly operating and maintenance costs. 
d.  At the city's discretion, the applicant may be required to escrow sufficient funds for the maintenance and operation costs of common facilities for up to one year. 
4.  Approval. The maintenance plan must be approved by the city concurrent with final development approval. The maintenance plan shall be recorded against the property and shall include provisions for the city's corrective action rights, as set forth herein. Any changes or amendments to the maintenance plan shall be approved by the city. 
5.  Failure to maintain. In the event that the organization established to maintain the open land, or any successor organization thereto, fails to maintain all or any portion thereof in reasonable order and condition, the city may assume responsibility, as a right but not an obligation, for maintenance, in which case any escrow funds may be forfeited and any permits may be revoked or suspended. 
6.  Corrective action. The city may enter the premises and take corrective action, including extended maintenance. The costs of such corrective action may be charged to the property owner and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on the land. Notice of such lien shall be filed by the city in the county recorder's office. The maintenance plan and all other documents creating or establishing any association or conservation organization for the property shall reference the city's corrective action authority set forth herein and shall be recorded against the land. 
K.  Shoreline trail. 
1.  Trail corridor. 
a.  The Utah Lake Master Plan identifies development and maintenance of the Utah Lake Trail as a high priority goal. The trail would provide a non-motorized route that circumnavigates Utah Lake, and provides access to lakeshore recreation facilities as well as connectivity among the communities that abut the lake. 
b.  American Fork City has identified the Utah Lake Trail as a component of its trails master plan, and has identified a preferred alignment for the trail on its trails map. The preferred location of the trail is as close to the lakeshore as possible, however the exact location of the Utah Lake trail through the city is flexible, and its ultimate location will depend on such factors as topography, natural features, the location of recreational and educational features, and land ownership. 
2.  Trail construction and dedication. 
a.  The location of the Utah Lake Trail and responsibility for the construction of the trail will be determined as a part of the review process as applications for development are submitted to the city. In the alternative, the city may independently decide to acquire land for construction and maintenance of the Utah Lake Trail in advance of receiving development applications. 
b.  Whether constructed by a developer or by the city, the Utah Lake Trail shall be in the ownership of American Fork City as a public facility. Maintenance of the Utah Lake Trail shall be performed by the city or pursuant to a contract or development agreement. 
c.  As development occurs in the vicinity of existing trail segments, the trail should be brought up to current standards. 
3.  Trail standards. 
a.  American Fork City adopts the current trail design standards developed by the Mountainland Association of Governments (MAG) for the Utah Lake Shoreline Trail for use in the city.

8.  Street Trees. Street trees are required along all street frontages, with the exception of the Alley. 
(1)  Street trees shall be located either in a Landscape Zone within a planting bed or lawn, or in a Furnishings Zone in tree wells with a grate as required. See Section 7. "Landscaping" for additional guidance concerning trees. 
(2)  Tree grates are required for all trees located in tree wells in Pedestrian Realms less than ten feet in width. 
9.  Fire Access. All configurations must conform to the City Fire Code 
2.3 - General Street Layout Requirements. 
1.  General Layout Standards. The following standards apply to new streets or newly platted vehicular Rights-of-Way. 
(1)  Treatment of Natural Features. Streets shall be designed to respect natural features, such as rivers, woodlands, or slopes, by following rather than interrupting or dead-ending at the feature. 
(2)  Street Network. The network of streets shall form an interconnected pattern with multiple intersections with each block having a length of 250-300 feet. 
(3)  Existing Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions. 
2.  Disconnected Streets. Disconnected streets may take the following form: 
(1)  Stub Streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provision for the future projection of streets into adjacent areas. 
(a)  Where abutting property is not subdivided, stub streets shall be provided at intervals no greater than the maximum block length and width recommended in Section 1.0. 
(b)  Existing stub streets adjacent to a proposed subdivision shall be connected. 
(2)  Half Streets. The construction of a half street shall be governed as set forth in the American Fork City Development Code. 
(3)  Cul-de-Sac Streets. Cul-de-sac streets are not permitted in any Place Type except where natural features prohibit the inclusion of a U-shaped street accessing the location. The following parameters shall be incorporated when the exception is taken: 
(a)  The Cul-de-sac shall not be more than 300 feet in length as measured along the centerline from the closest intersection. 
(b)  The Cul-de-sac shall have a maximum outside turning radius of 50 feet. 
(c)  A pedestrian sidewalk connection from the cul-de-sac through to the next closest street or sidewalk. 
3.  Intersections.   
(1)  Curb Radii. The following curb radii shall be utilized unless otherwise authorized by the City Engineer. 
(a)  Intersections should be designed for actual turning radius of the typical design vehicle as opposed to the maximum design vehicle. Small curb radii at intersections shorten pedestrian crossing distances and reduce vehicle turning speeds, thereby balancing the ease of travel of the vehicles and pedestrians. Refer to Figure 2.3 (1). 
(b)  At the intersections with the 300/200 South corridor the following curb radii shall be utilized: 
(i)  With on-street parking on both streets, a 10 foot radius is required. 
(ii)  Without on-street parking on either streets, a 25 foot radius is required. 
(iii)  Larger Radius. When the design vehicle requires a larger curb radius and no on-street parking exists, a 30 foot radius may be utilized. Larger radii require approval of the City Engineer. 
(c)  For all other intersections the following curb radii shall be utilized. 
(i)  With on-street parking on both streets, a 5 foot radius may be utilized. 
(ii)  Without on-street parking, a 15 foot radius is required 
(d)  Alley Intersections. The curb radius at intersections involving Alleys shall be no greater than 5 feet. 
(2)  Crosswalks. Crosswalks shall be required at all intersections. 
(a)  Dimensions. Crosswalks shall be minimum six feet in width, measured from mid-stripe to mid-stripe, per MUTCD. 
(b)  Markings. Crosswalks shall be appropriately indicated on the finished street surface with painted markings and/or textured or colored pavement. 
(c)  Crossing Distances. To encourage pedestrian activity, typical crosswalks shall not extend over 38 feet without a landscape median, bulb-outs and/or other pedestrian refuge to mitigate the effects of vehicular traffic on crossing and increase pedestrian safety and comfort. Refer to Figure 2.3 (2). 
(d)  Accessible ramps and warning panels, per the American Disabilities Act or any more stringent state requirement, are required where all sidewalks or trails terminate at a crosswalk or curb. 
(e)  Ramp Orientation. Ramps shall be oriented perpendicular to traffic, requiring two ramps per corner at intersecting streets. 
(3)  Bulb-outs. To shorten pedestrian crossing distances, bulb-outs should be utilized at all intersections, unless otherwise required by the City Engineer. Refer to Figure 2.3 (3). 
(a)  The depth of the bulb-out shall match the utilized on-street parking, either the width of the parallel space or the depth of the diagonal space. 
(b)  The radius of the bulb-out shall match the requirements for the intersection.

3.0 - Districts 

3.1 - Introduction. 
The following Districts are hereby created to regulate the location of distinct mixes of building forms and uses permitted within the Place Types. Refer to 4.0 Uses for uses and 5.0 Building Types for building types permitted within each district. 
The districts are organized into four categories representative of a typical traditional neighborhood structure: mixed use core, office core, general mixed use, and residential edge districts. 
1.  Core Districts. The Core Districts constitute the center or the locus of the community. The center includes the majority of the shops and workplaces within the neighborhood, along with the public gathering spaces such as churches, libraries, squares, and plazas. The storefront building and civic building create the form of the neighborhood center in varying degrees. The storefront building defines a street wall along the primary streets of the area with storefront glass windows. Upper stories of the storefront building may be utilized for living and working. The following Core Districts are defined: 
(1)  Mixed Use Core 
(2)  Office Core 
2.  General Districts. The General Districts serve as the interstitial fabric of the city, separate from the defined center or core and the edges. The more generic stoop building with lower minimum transparency levels dominates, mainly occupied by office and residential uses at a variety of scales. 
(1)  General Mixed Use District 
3.  Edge Districts. The Edge Districts typically assign a lower intensity of building to provide a buffer between single family neighborhoods and the Core and General Districts. 
(1)  Residential Edge 
3.2 - Zoning Map. 
1.  Mapped Districts. The areas and boundaries of the districts listed in 3.1 above are established as shown on the map entitled "District Map of American Fork Station Area." found on the next page.

4.0 - Uses 

4.1 - General Requirements. 
1.  General Provisions. The following general provisions apply to the uses outlined in this section. 
(1)  A lot may contain more than one use if located within a mixed use district. 
(2)  Each of the uses may function as either a principal use or accessory use on a lot, unless otherwise specified. 
(3)  Uses are permitted by-right in a district with specific development and design parameters. 
(4)  Each use shall be located within a permitted Building Type (Refer to 5.0 Building Types), unless otherwise specified. 
(5)  Each use may have both indoor and outdoor facilities, unless otherwise specified. 
2.  Organization. The uses are grouped into general categories, which may contain lists of additional uses or clusters of uses. 
(1)  Unlisted Similar Use. If a use is not listed but is similar in nature and impact to a use permitted within a zoning district, the Planning Commission may interpret the use as permitted. The unlisted use will be subject to any development standards applicable to the similar permitted use. 
(2)  Unlisted Dissimilar Use. If a use is not listed and cannot be interpreted by the Planning Commission as similar in nature the use is not permitted. 
3.  Use Table. Table 4.1 (1). Uses by District outlines the permitted uses in each zoning district. Each use is given one of the following designations for each zoning district in which that use is permitted. 
(1)  Permitted ("?"). These uses are permitted by-right in the districts in which they are listed. 
(2)  Permitted in Upper Stories Only ("?"). These uses are permitted by-right in the districts in which they are listed, provided that the uses are located in the upper stories of a structure. These uses may also be located in the ground story provided that they are located beyond a depth of at least 30 feet from the front facade. 
(3)  Permitted with Development Standards ("?"). These uses are permitted by-right in the districts in which they are listed, provided that they are developed utilizing the listed development standards. These standards are intended to alleviate any negative impacts associated with the use, making it appropriate in a district where it otherwise might not have been appropriate. 
(4)  Listed uses that are not permitted in the district are indicated by a blank space. 
4.  Building Types. The uses permitted within the district may be further limited by the building types permitted. Refer to 5.0 Building Types. 
4.2 - Definition of Uses. 
1.  Residential and Lodging Uses. A category of uses that include several residence types. 
(1)  Residential. One or more dwelling units located within the principal structure of a lot, in which the units may or may not share a common wall with the adjacent (horizontally or vertically) unit or have individual entrances from the outside. 
(2)  Hotel & Inn. A facility offering temporary or permanent lodging to the general public consisting of sleeping rooms with or without in-room kitchen facilities. Secondary service uses may also be provided, such as restaurants and meeting rooms. Rooms shall be accessed from the interior of the building. 
(3)  Residential Care. Residential care includes such uses as independent and assisted living facilities, nursing homes, residential care homes, and transitional treatment facilities. Assistance with daily activities may be provided for residents. Secondary service uses may also be provided, such as restaurants and meeting rooms. Rooms shall be accessed from the interior of the building. Residential care facilities located within mixed use core areas shall be auxiliary (up to 50% of the total floor area) to a primary commercial or office use, and shall be permitted in upper stories only. In the districts where a residential care facility is permitted with development standards ("?"), the facility is limited to twelve rooms. 
2.  Civic Uses. A category of uses related to fulfilling the needs of day-to-day community life including assembly, public services, educational facilities, and hospitals.

d.  Each message shall be illuminated for at least eight seconds before transitioning to a new message. 
9.  A minimum annual business license shall be required for each sign. Failure to maintain the sign in the manner identified in subsection 7. above shall be grounds for denial of the license. Failure of the owner to maintain the sign or sign premises, or to secure the required license for a continuous period of one year shall be considered an abandonment of the sign. 
10.  The city council may, after ten-day written notice to the owner and following a hearing held thereon, cause to be removed any sign for which a building permit has not been issued or annual license maintained or which is found to be materially, structurally, or electrically defective. 
11.  Where the provisions of this section conflict with any state regulations concerning billboards, the more stringent shall prevail.

5.  Lot layout. The proposed lot layout (or dwelling site area where individual lots are not proposed) and defined building envelope must duly recognize the relationship of new dwellings to existing adjacent dwellings (i.e., rear lots should abut rear lot areas of existing structures). Wherever possible, the access road system should not create double-frontage lots. 
6.  Flag lots permitted. Where the project area contains unusual shapes or peninsulas, not readily accessed directly from the proposed inner-block street, the city council, subject to the prior recommendation of the planning commission, may approve a lot layout which includes one or more flag lots. 
7.  Building envelope to be shown-Setback standards. 
a.  Each lot or designated building site shall show a defined building envelope. Each dwelling structure shall be located within the boundaries of the defined building envelope. 
b.  The proposed location of each dwelling or defined building envelope shall be shown on the preliminary plan and final plat. The defined building envelope area shall be established in accordance with the following setback criteria; provided that the city council, subject to receipt of a prior recommendation from the planning commission, may approve a defined building envelope for one or more buildings at variance with the setback criteria, upon a finding that the lot or building site contains unique conditions or circumstances, not of the making of the applicant, which justify the variance from strict compliance and the adjusted location does not result in an unsafe condition or an undue intrusion upon adjacent properties. 
(1)  Front setback. Twenty-five feet, as measured from the street dedication or sidewalk easement line, whichever is closer to the proposed dwelling; provided that no adjustment from this standard setback shall result in a driveway which is less than twenty feet in length, as measured from the garage to the closest abutting sidewalk.

8.  Fences permitted . The project area shall be enclosed within a fence or wall having a height of not less than six feet (except where required to provide clear vision to traffic and pedestrians). Private fences separating individual lots within the project are allowed, provided the following criteria are met: (1) the fence shall be no greater than six feet in height, (2) the fence may be placed on the side lot lines provided the fence is set back a minimum of twenty- five feet from the front property line, (3) no fencing shall be allowed within the front setback area or within the area enclosing the front yard, (4) fencing on corner lots shall be allowed, provided that: (a) property that adjoins the rear yard of a corner lot has no existing driveway within ten feet of the property line adjoining the corner lot, (b) fence must drop to three feet within sight distance area, as determined by Engineering, if driveway on adjoining lot is less than ten feet from the fence, (c) fence to be located on property line or one foot off of the sidewalk, whichever is greater, and (d) fence must meet the sight distance standards detailed in the American Fork City Development Code 17.5.110 (fig. 17.5.110-A). In addition, an accessible means of egress from the rear yard to the public right-of-way shall be provided (i.e. gate) in accordance with Section 1002 of the International Fire Code. 
9.  Architectural compatibility. 
a.  It is the intent of this section that new structures be of a character which is consistent and compatible with the bulk, height, style and construction materials of existing dwellings in the immediate vicinity, to the end that any new construction will not result in the introduction of building styles or exterior surface materials which are inconsistent with the overall character of the area. 
b.  As part of the submittal for approval of an inner-block cottage development project, the developer shall submit a copy of the architectural plan for each unit intended to be constructed within the project area, including building elevations and a schedule of exterior surface materials to be used, and shall indicate the lot upon which each such plan will be constructed. The city may require changes in the plans and materials in order to more fully achieve the purposes of this section. 
10.  Lots adjacent to existing streets to conform with requirements of underlying zone-Exceptions. Any lot or designated building site (whether included within the inner-block cottage development project or proposed as a residual parcel), which abut(s) on an existing street, must conform to the minimum zone requirements of the underlying zone (i.e., width and size of lot, setback requirements, etc.); provided, that, the city council, with the prior recommendation of the planning commission, may reduce the minimum width requirement for a residual lot adjacent to a proposed project access street and fronting on an existing street provided: 
a.  That any existing dwelling on said parcel will be set back not less than twenty feet from the access street or adjacent sidewalk, if applicable; and 
b.  That the width of the residual lot and other characteristics constitute a logical parcel for building purposes. 
11.  Phased construction. Where an inner-block project is proposed to be constructed in phases, each phase shall be designed as if the phase were to become the ultimate development.
