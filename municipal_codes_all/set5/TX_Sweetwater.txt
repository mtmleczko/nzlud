PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the 1956 Code of the City of Sweetwater and subsequent ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1956 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1956 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is numbered 6-1 and the third section of Chapter 10 is 10-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 15-5 and 15-6 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 15-5.1, 15-5.2 and 15-5.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 8 and 9, it will be designated as Chapter 8.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Thomas B. Calhoun, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Bob Hart, City Manager, Kenneth Roussel, Director of Finance and Charles Griggs, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    Section 5. Any and all additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the governing body to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code shall be understood and intended to include the additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. In case of the amendment of any section of the Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in Section 1-11 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended, or in case the amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in the other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless the penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
    Section 7. All ordinances adopted after December 13, 1983, which amend or refer to ordinances which have been codified in such Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of such Code. 
    Section 8.

If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at that date under a joint and survivor annuity (Option 1) payable during the lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse.

    In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transition surfaces, horizontal surface and conical surface as they apply to the municipal airport. Such zones are shown on a zoning map consisting of one (1) sheet, prepared by the Texas Aeronautics Commission, Austin, Texas and dated October 3, 1979, which is adopted by reference and made a part of this article. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. 
a.  Runways 3/21 and 16/34 approach zones are established beneath the approach surface at the ends of runways 3/21 and 16/34 on the municipal airport for nonprecision instrument landings and take-offs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a width of five hundred (500) feet which coincides with the width of the primary surface at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred (3,500) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet beyond each end of the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
b.  Runway 13/31 approach zone is established beneath the approach surface at the ends of runway 13/31 on the municipal airport for visual landings and take-offs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a width of two hundred fifty (250) feet which coincides with the width of the primary surface at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet beyond each end of the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the zoning map adopted by this section. Transition surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) to one (1) from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of approach surfaces. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of runways 3/21 and 16/34 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(4)  Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet.

Sec. 3-122. - Height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limitations established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. 
a.  Runways 3/21 and 16/34, one (1) foot in height for each thirty-four (34) feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the primary surface and extending to a point ten thousand (10,000) feet from the end of the primary surface. 
b.  Runway 13/31, one (1) foot in height for each twenty (20) feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the primary surface and extending to a point five thousand (5,000) feet from the end of the primary surface. 
(2)  Transition zones. Slope seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is two thousand three hundred seventy-four (2,374) feet above mean sea level. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation, or a height of two thousand five hundred twenty-four (2,524) feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
(5)  Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to thirty-five (35) feet above the surface of the land. 
(Ord. of 3-10-81, § 4) 
Sec. 3-123. - Use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
(Ord. of 3-10-81, § 5) 
Sec. 3-124. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Not retroactive. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to this article as of March 10, 1981, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alternation of which was begun prior to March 10, 1981. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city manager, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city. 
(Ord. of 3-10-81, § 6) 
Sec. 3-125. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3), no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created by this article unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity for it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the provisions of this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d). 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 3-122(5). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on March 10, 1981, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated; all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city manager determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this article. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, in violation of the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the provision in question. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the federal aviation administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, would do substantial justice, and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the joint airport zoning board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the joint airport zoning board does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable by the city manager or the board of adjustment to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to allow the city manager to install, operate, and maintain, at the expense of the city, such markings and lights as may be necessary. 
(Ord. of 3-10-81, § 7) 
Sec. 3-126. - Filing application for permits. 
    Applications for permits required by section 3-125 shall be made to the city manager upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required to be submitted to the city manager shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Applications for variances shall be made to the board of adjustment by first filing the application for a variance with the city manager who shall forthwith transmit the application to the board of adjustment for determination.

Such filing shall constitute a non-transferable lien against the real property on which the structure stands or stood, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, and the lien runs with the land. The lien is extinguished if the property owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the municipality for the expenses.

The action may also include a claim for civil penalties as provided by Article 1175 of Vernon's Annotated Civil Statutes. 
In connection with the action, the city may file a notice of lis pendens in the office of the county clerk and, if the city files a notice, any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee who acquires an interest in the property takes the property subject to the enforcement proceeding and all subsequent orders of the court.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 87-03, adopted Feb. 10, 1987, repealed former Ch. 11, relative to flood hazard prevention, and enacted in lieu thereof a new Ch. 11 to read as herein set out in §§ 11-1-11-16. The provisions of former Ch. 11 derived from §§ 1, 2, 5-13, and 15-21 of an ordinance adopted Dec. 9, 1980, and from original codification. 
Cross reference- Water and wastewater, Ch. 29. 
State Law reference- Authority to enact flood-insurance ordinance, V.T.C.A., Water Code, § 16.315. 

Sec. 11-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in Vernon's Texas Code Annotated, Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Commission of Sweetwater, Texas, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 87-03, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 11-2. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Sweetwater are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 87-03, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 11-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that the property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 87-03, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 11-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 87-03, 2-10-87) 
Sec. 11-5. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Appeal means a request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one (1) percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM on February 18, 1980. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition or partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or run-off of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for the following purposes; which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a "habitable floor." 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    Mean sea level means, for purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specification which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed in the Natural Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 11-6. - General provisions. 
(1)  Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Sweetwater, Texas. 
(2)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for City of Sweetwater," dated November 5, 1980, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. 
(3)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(6)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(7)  Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(3)  Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by adoption of this chapter. 
(4)  Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required. 
(5)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
(6)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency which is the Division of Emergency Management prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(7)  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(8)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 11-6(2), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of sections 11-1 through 11-16. 
(9)  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

Sec. 11-15. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6(2), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures [shall]: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 11-9(1)(a), are satisfied.

(a)  Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in this division, pedestrians, facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 19-40, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and may then turn right or, if the intersecting streets are both one-way streets and left turns are permissible, may turn left, after standing until the intersection may be entered safely, yielding right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Traffic not so turning shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. Turns shall be prohibited on a steady red sign if a notice is posted at such intersection giving notice that such turns are prohibited. 
b.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in this division, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals as applicable to vehicles.

(a)  Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign or signal, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through an intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(b)  This section does not apply to railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in section 19-77 of this Code.

(1)  Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles. 
(2)  Don't Walk or Wait: No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on the "Walk" signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the "Don't Walk" or "Wait" signal is showing.

(3)  No permit for excavation for any building shall be issued before application has been made for a certificate of occupancy and compliance. 
Section 11. - Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Any use of property existing at the time of the passage of this ordinance that does not conform to the regulations prescribed in the preceding sections of this ordinance shall be deemed a nonconforming use; except that any duplex or apartment use existing at the time of the passage of this ordinance, in any commercial or manufacturing district, shall be deemed a conforming use upon the lot devoted to such use at the time of the passage of this ordinance. 
(2)  The lawful use of land existing at the time of passage of this ordinance, although such does not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued; but if such nonconforming use is discontinued, any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
    If a building occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or the elements it may not be reconstructed or rebuilt except to conform with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  The lawful use of the building at the time of the passage of this ordinance may be continued, although such does not conform to the provisions hereof, and such use may be extended throughout the building provided no structural alteration, except those required by law or ordinance, are made therein. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification; provided, however, that in the event a nonconforming use of a building is once changed to a nonconforming use of a higher or more restricted classification, it shall not later revert to the former lower or less restricted classification. 
(4)  The right of nonconforming use to continue shall be subject to such regulations as to maintenance of the premises and conditions of operation as may in the judgment of the Board of Adjustment be reasonably required for the protection of adjacent property. 
(5)  Nothing in this ordinance shall be taken to prevent restoration of a building destroyed to the extent of not more than sixty (60%) per cent of its reasonable value by fire, explosion or other casualty, or act of God, or a public enemy, nor the continued occupancy or use of such building, or part thereof, which existed at the time of such partial destruction. 
(6)  In dwelling Districts "A" and "B" all buildings, excepting outhouses in the rear of the lot, shall be constructed to face the front of the lot as it was originally platted. It is contemplated by such requirement that a conformity in frontage will be seemly, will permit of easier service in the rear by public utilities and will prevent the rear premises of one person from abutting upon the front premises of another. However, the Board of Adjustment may make special exceptions hereto where the public would be benefited thereby, or where, before the adoption of this ordinance, there has been such rearrangement of the lot or frontage of buildings as to reasonably justify such special exception.

    The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, give the public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by attorney or by agent. 
(c)  The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
(2)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which the Board is required to pass under this ordinance. 
(3)  To authorize upon appeal in special cases, such variances from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, the literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. 
(d)  In exercising its powers the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of Articles 1011A and including 1011J of the 1925 Civil Statutes of Texas, revise or reform, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
(e)  The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to revise any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in flavor of the application [applicant] on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to affect any variance in said ordinance. 
(f)  Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment or any taxpayer or any officer, department, or Board of the Municipality may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.

    Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building actually under construction at the time of the passage of this ordinance and which entire building shall be complete within one (1) year from the passage of this ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plan, construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been heretofore issued and which entire building shall be complete within six (6) months from the date of the passage of this ordinance.
