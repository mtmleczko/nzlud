CHARTER OF THE TOWN OF WINDSOR
Chapter I. Town Officers Responsible to Citizens: Town Meetings
Sec. 1. Authority of citizens
All governmental authority of the town of Windsor rests with the citizens of the town,
who exercise their powers at town meeting, and to whom the elected and appointed
officers of the town are ultimately responsible.
Preface
Under authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Vermont, the voters of
the Town of Windsor adopt a charter for the following purposes:
(a) to clarify the structure and organization of town government;
(b) to define the duties and responsibilities of town officers, officials and employees;
(c) to establish procedural requirements for the proper transaction of town business; and
(d) to provide for the citizens of the town of Windsor a unified and convenient reference
with respect to the basic laws affecting government.
Sec. 2. Town meetings
(a) An annual town meeting for the consideration of the budget and other town business
shall be held according to State law except as hereinafter provided.
(b) A special town meeting-
(1) may be called by a majority of the selectboard, or
(2) shall be called by the town clerk upon receipt by the clerk of a petition signed by at
least five percent (5%) of the voters, specifying the business to be transacted at the
meeting.
(c) Whenever an issue or election is to be decided by Australian ballot, the ballot boxes
shall be opened no earlier than 6:00 a.m., but no later than 10:00 a.m., as determined by
the board of civil authority as provided in Vermont Statutes Annotated, and shall close at
7:00 p.m.
Sec. 3. Postponement and combining of town meetings
(a) The selectboard may postpone the vote on any question to be voted at a special
meeting to the annual meeting or November federal elections if the special meeting
would fall within 75 days of the annual meeting or November federal elections.
2
(b) If a special town Meeting falls within 45 days of a later special town meeting called
by petition, the selectboard may warn the question to be voted at the town meeting, and
may by resolution rescind the call of the earlier meeting.
Sec. 4. Australian ballots
At any annual or special town meeting, the selectboard may cause any question to be
decided by Australian ballot, provided that the warning for the meeting specifies the
questions to be decided in that manner. A meeting at which any question is to be decided

the meeting shall include a notice of the time and place of the Public Hearing.
Sec. 5. [Repealed]
Sec. 6. Conduct
(a) The moderator shall preside at all town meetings, but in the moderator's absence, the

moderator shall conduct every meeting according to this charter, the laws of the state of
Vermont, and Roberts' Rules of Order, Newly Revised, when not in conflict with this
charter or the laws of the state of Vermont. The moderator shall preserve order in the
conduct of the business of the meeting and in all things preserve the principles of fairness
and openness in town government.
(b) The town clerk shall be the presiding officer at all town elections by Australian
ballots and shall cooperate with the board of civil authority to assure that all laws relating
to elections are faithfully observed. While the polls are open, the town clerk may rule on
all questions concerning the conduct of the election and shall not be disqualified from
performing any duties by reason of his or her own candidacy for any office. In the town
clerk's absence, the members of the board of civil authority who are present may
designate one of their members to perform the town clerk's duties under this section.
Sec. 7. Reconsideration of actions taken
A question considered at any town meeting or election may not be submitted to the voters
for reconsideration or rescission except at a subsequent annual or special meeting or
election, specifically warned for the purpose and called by the selectboard by resolution
or by the town clerk pursuant to a petition requesting reconsideration or rescission. The
petition must be signed by not less than ten percent (10%) of the voters and filed with the
town clerk within 30 days following the date of the meeting or election at which the
question was first considered. The clerk shall call for a vote in accordance with the
petition within 60 days of the date of filing. The manner of reconsideration shall be the
same manner by which the question was originally considered. A question voted on or
considered shall not be presented for reconsideration or rescission more than one time;
provided, however, that after the passing of at least eight months from the date of any
such reconsideration or rescission, the same or a similar question may be newly
3
submitted for consideration. Unless rescinded as provided in this section, any vote or
action lawfully taken at a town meeting or election shall remain in effect indefinitely. A
vote to reconsider or rescind shall not be effective unless the number of votes cast in

votes cast for the prevailing side at the original meeting.

as determined by the Superintendent then the applicant can apply directly to the Superintendent.
A preliminary determination by the Superintendent for allocation capacity shall not constitute a
binding commitment of capacity to the applicant and may be revoked by the Superintendent
before a final allocation of capacity is granted if uncommitted reserve capacity ceases to be
available. A preliminary determination may be used by the applicant to show that the wastewater
treatment facility has potentially has capacity available for the proposed project to proceed
through the design review process.
D. Final Capacity Allocation
An applicant who holds a preliminary allocation of capacity may apply for a final
application upon occurrence of the following:
1. Obtained site plan, conditional use and/or variance approval(s), if such approvals are the
only approvals except a zoning permit, required for the proposed development under City
zoning and subdivisions regulations then in effect; or

regulations then in effect.
Upon receipt of an application for a final allocation, the Commission shall grant a final allocation
upon determination that the applicant has a preliminary allocation which has not been revoked
and that sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity is available for the development.
A grant of final allocation shall constitute a binding commitment of wastewater capacity to the
applicant subject to the applicants compliance imposed on such allocation and adherence to all
state and local regulations. The final allocation shall specify the allowed flows and loadings and
any other characteristics determined appropriate by the Commission. The capacity allocation is
not transferable to any other person or development, except a successor in interest of the
development for which the allocation has been granted.
E. Expiration of Allocation
1. A final capacity allocation shall expire on the date that any approval required for grant of
the final allocation expires unless the applicant has obtained a zoning permit or permits
for the development and initiated the action for which the zoning permit has been
granted.

source of surface runoff , groundwater, standing or large volumes of stored water(pool
water) to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved by the town for
purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.
2.9 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
The categorical pretreatment standards are found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and
are hereby incorporated into the regulation.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Commission may impose equivalent concentration
or mass limitations in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
B. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not
regulated by the same standard, the Commission shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).

35
C. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove,
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
D. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15. The USEPA shall be the Control Authority for industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards. As the Control Authority, industrial users are responsible to the EPA for
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and the requirements of 40 CFR Part 403.
Categorical industrial users shall provide the town with copies of any reports to, or
correspondence with EPA relative to compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards.
The industrial user is responsible for determining the applicability of categorical pretreatment
standards. The user may request that EPA provide written certification on whether the user is
subject to the requirements of a particular category. The town shall provide timely notification to
appropriate industrial users of applicable categorical pretreatment standards. Upon promulgation
of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the
federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this regulation for sources in
that subcategory, shall, on the compliance date of the categorical pretreatment standards,
immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this regulation. Compliance with
categorical pretreatment standards shall be achieved within one (1) year of the date such
standards are effective, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standards. An
industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall not discharge wastewater
directly or indirectly to the town’s POTW subsequent to the compliance date of such standards
unless an amendment to its industrial discharge Permit has been issued by the town.
2.10 State Pretreatment Standards
Users must comply with Vermont state pretreatment standards, issued by the Department of
Environmental Conservation, where applicable.
2.11 Local Discharge Restrictions
All persons discharging industrial process wastes into public or private sewers connected to the town's
POTW shall comply with applicable federal requirements and state standards for pretreatment of wastes
as they may be amended from time to time in addition to the requirements of this regulation. Local
numerical discharge limitations established by the town as set forth herein (referred to as "local limits"),
and all state pretreatment standards and USEPA categorical pretreatment standards shall apply, whichever
is most stringent. In developing the list of pollutants of concern for which local limits are established, the
town has considered the allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility. Pollutants that
exceed fifty percent (50%) of their allowable headworks loading at the wastewater treatment facility are
considered to be of concern and have resulted in development of local limits. If any waters or wastes are
discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW that exceed the standards or restrictions
established in Sections 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 of this regulation, which in the judgment of the Superintendent
may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that
otherwise create a hazard to worker safety or health, or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent
may: Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after notice has been served to the discharger and the
discharger has had reasonable opportunity to respond;
Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW (Section 3.0);
Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
Require payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes.

36
If the Commission allows the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of
the systems and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Commission and the state
(see Section 3).
A. The Commission may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the requirements of Section 2.1. The
Commission shall calculate and administer daily concentration limits (i.e., local limits) when
required as described below to ensure that the combined industrial pollutant discharge loadings
do not cause or contribute to exceedances of these limitations. For industrial discharge
applications, the local limits [presented above] shall apply at the end of the process train prior to
dilution with non-industrial wastewaters. Daily concentrations are the concentration of a pollutant
discharged, determined from the analysis of a flow composited sample (or other sampling
procedure approved by the Commission) representative of the discharge over the duration of a 24-
hour day or industrial operating schedule of less than 24 hours. All concentration limits for
metals represent a total metal unless indicated otherwise. The Commission may impose mass
limitations in addition to, or in accordance with Section 2.9, in place of the concentration-based
limitations. Local limits are developed based on the identification of industrial users known to be
discharging each pollutant (industrial contributory flow procedure). Unless specifically identified
in an industrial discharge permit, an industrial user shall not discharge the locally limited
pollutants at concentrations 20 percent greater than the background concentrations used for local
limits development.
B. Pollution Prevention Action. Pollutants for which pollution prevention efforts are required of all
significant industrial users and other industrial and non-industrial users at the discretion of the
Commission include:
Endocrine disrupting chemicals, which are found in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, plastics, personal
care products and many industrial byproducts. Failure to control these pollutants through
pollution prevention activities will result in development and application of a local limit when a
pollutant loading to the POTW exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the allowable headworks loading.
2.12 Town’s Right of Revision
The Commission reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge
permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose
of this ordinance.
2.13 Dilution
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment standard or requirement. The Commission may
impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

SECTION 3—PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
3.1 Pretreatment Facilities
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this ordinance and shall achieve
compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section
2.7 of this ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the Commission,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall
be submitted to the Commission for review, and shall be acceptable to the Commission before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to
the town under the provisions of this ordinance.
3.2 Additional Pretreatment Measures
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the Commission may require users to restrict their discharge during
peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user’s compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
B. The Commission may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on
their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Commission, they
are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and
oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Commission, and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection at the users expense.
D. Grease, oil and/or sand traps/interceptors -shall be provided in all garages, filling stations,
restaurants, cleaning establishments and wizen, in the opinion of the Commission, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease or floatable oil in excessive
amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients that are discharged from
floor drains, sinks or other plumbing fixtures into the treatment works.
E. All traps/interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Commission and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
F. Grease and oil traps/interceptors shall be constructed and installed in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to Title V of the State
Sanitary Code, the Vermont Plumbing Code, and the Plumbing and Drainage Institute (PDI)
Specification G-1O1. Both shall be made of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt
and extreme changes in temperature. Grease and oil traps/interceptors shall be equipped with an
aerated flow control device which promotes the removal of grease/oil and reduces wastewater
velocities due to flow surges. Exterior grease, oil, and sand traps/interceptors shall have a

minimum of a one thousand (1,000) gallons capacity, interior grease, oil, and sand
traps/interceptors shall be sized according, to flow capacity. All traps shall be of substantial
construction, water tight, and equipped with easily removable covers which when bolted into
place shall be gaslight and watertight. It is prohibited to add any surfactants, enzyme;
bacteriological cultures, dispersants, or cleaning agents to plumbing lines that cause or contribute
to the pass-through of oils and greases or inhibit or interfere with the proper operation of a grease
trap. Deviations from the above descriptions shall require written approval from the Commission.
F. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
G. At no time shall two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the
POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be more than ten percent (10%) nor any single reading over
ten percent (10%) of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the meter.
3.3 Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plans
The Commission shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control
plan or other action to control slug discharges. The Commission may require any user to develop, submit
for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug
discharges. Alternatively, the Commission may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
A. Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the Commission of any accidental discharge or slug
discharge, as required by Section 6.6 of this ordinance; and
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures
include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
3.4 Pollution Prevention Plans
The Commission may require any person discharging wastes into the POTW to develop and implement,
at that person’s own expense, a pollution prevention plan. The Commission may require users to submit
as part of the pollution prevention plan information that demonstrates adherence to the following
elements:
A. Management Support. For changes to be effective, the visible support of top management is
required. Management's support should be explicitly stated and include designation of a pollution
prevention coordinator, goals, and time frames for reductions in volume and toxicity of waste
streams, and procedures for employee training and involvement.
B. Process Characterization. A detailed process waste diagram shall be developed that identifies and
characterizes the input of raw materials, the outflow of products, and the generation of wastes.

C. Waste Assessment. Estimates shall be developed for the amount of wastes generated by each
process. This may include establishing and maintaining waste accounting systems to track
sources, the rates and dates of generation, and the presence of hazardous constituents.
D. Analysis of waste management economics. Waste management economic returns shall be
determined based on the consideration of:
1. Reduced raw material purchases;
2. Avoidance of waste treatment, monitoring and disposal costs;
3. Reductions in operations and maintenance expenses;
4. Elimination of permitting fees and compliance costs; and
5. Reduced liabilities for employee/public exposure to hazardous chemicals and cleanup of
waste disposal sites.
E. Development of Pollution Prevention Alternatives. Current and past pollution prevention
activities should be assessed, including estimates of the reduction in the amount and toxicity of
waste achieved by the identified actions. Opportunities for pollution prevention must then be
assessed for identified processes where raw materials become or generate wastes. Technical
information on pollution prevention should be solicited and exchanged, both from inside the
organization and out.
F. Evaluation and Implementation. Technically and economically feasible pollution prevention
opportunities shall be identified and an implementation timetable with interim and final
milestones shall be developed. The recommendations that are implemented shall be periodically
reviewed for effectiveness. The review and approval of such pollution prevention plans by the
town shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibilities of modifying facilities as necessary
to produce a discharge acceptable to the town in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
3.5 Vandalism
No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent
access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in
violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in Sections 10 through 12 of this

6.11 Sample Collection
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
A. Except as indicated in Section B and C below, the user must collect wastewater samples using
24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Commission. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Commission, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may
be composite prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples
may be composite in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. The Commission, as appropriate, as documented in
approved EPA methodologies may authorize composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with instantaneous limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required
in Section 6.1 and 6.3 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, The Commission may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports
required by paragraphs Section 6.4 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
6.12 Date of Receipt of Reports
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are
not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of
receipt of the report shall govern.
6.13 Recordkeeping
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for
inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best
Management Practices established under Section 2.5 C. Records shall include the date, exact place,
method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of
such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Commission,
or where the Commission has specifically notified the user of a longer retention period.

A. When the Commission finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this
ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Commission may serve upon that user a Notice of Violation. This
Notice of Violation may be verbal or in written form. If so required, within fourteen (14) days of
the receipt of this notice, or by the response date cited on this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Commission. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice
of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the town to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of
Violation.
B. Any user found to have a source of clean water (I/I) such as a sump pump, basement drain,
foundation drain, yard or area drain, roof downspout or other source of surface runoff or
groundwater or other source connected to the building sewer, shall be served by the town with a
written Notice of Violation stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time
limit for the satisfactory correction (removal) thereof. The offender shall, within the period of
time stated in such Notice, permanently cease and correct all violations.
10.2 Consent Orders
The Commission may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
10.3 Show Cause Hearing
The Commission may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Commission and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 3 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the user as defined in Section
1.4 C and required by Section 4.7 A. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
10.4 Compliance Orders
When the Commission finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Commission may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come

into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders
also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
10.5 Cease and Desist Orders
When the Commission finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Commission
may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
10.6 Administrative Fines
A. When the Commission finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Commission may fine such user to the full extent of the law but not
to exceed five thousand ($5,000) dollars per day. Each day the violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Any user found to have failed to permanently remove a connection of clean water (I/I) such as a
sump pump, basement drain, foundation drain, yard or area drain, roof downspout or other source
of surface runoff, groundwater or stored water from the building sewer within the period of time
stated in the Notice of Violation, whether intentionally, unintentionally or accidentally, shall be
assessed a penalty pursuant to the full extent of the law until the connection is permanently
removed and the clean water is redirected to a legal discharge location and the redirection is
confirmed by the town. The fines will be added to the quarterly water and sewer bills and will be
payable upon receipt. The town may also assess additional fines.
C. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an
additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter
at the statutory rate. A lien against the user’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines,
and penalties and otherwise statutory liens will apply.
D. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Commission to reconsider
the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the

fine. Where a request has merit, the Commission shall convene a hearing on the matter within
thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user’s appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.
The town may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
E. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
10.7 Emergency Suspensions
The Commission may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to
present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
Commission may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond,
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Commission may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Commission may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 10.8 of
this ordinance are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Commission prior to
the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 10.3 or 10.8 of this ordinance.
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension
under this Section.
10.8 Termination of Discharge
In addition to the provisions in Section 5.6 of this ordinance, any user who violates the following
conditions is subject to discharge termination:
A. Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
C. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and
characteristics prior to discharge;
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or
sampling; or
E. Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 2 of this ordinance.

Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to
show cause under Section 10.3 of this ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Commission shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.

ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Commission may petition the Superior Court through
the town’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The
Commission may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.

the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each
day during the period of the violation.
B. The Commission may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost

circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other

11.4 Remedies Nonexclusive
The provisions in Sections 9 through 12 of this ordinance are not exclusive remedies. The town reserves
the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement
of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the town’s enforcement response plan.
However, the town reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the town is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.

SECTION 13—AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
13.1 Upset
A. For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the Commission within twenty-four
(24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within five (5) days]:
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of
the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have
the burden of proof.
E. users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance
with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment
facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
13.2 Prohibited Discharge Standards
A. User shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 2.1(A) of this ordinance or the specific
prohibitions in Sections 2.1(B)(3) through 18 of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know,

or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either:
B. A local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit
directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through or Interference; or
C. No local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from
the user’s prior discharge when the town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and
in the case of Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
13.3 Bypass
A. For the purposes of this Section,
1. Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user’s
treatment facility.
2. Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by
delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this
Section.
C. Bypass Notifications
1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
Commission, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the Commission of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5)
days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Commission may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
D. Bypass
1. Bypass is prohibited, and the Commission may take an enforcement action against a user
for a bypass, unless
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage;

(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods
of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
2. The Commission may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse
effects, if the Commission determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in

ARTICLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.01 AUTHORITY
This ordinance is adopted under the authority granted by 24 V.S.A. §1971 and 19 V.S.A. §304.
1.02 PURPOSE
This ordinance2 has been adopted in order to:
A. Establish standards for construction, improvement, and use of public highways in
order to ensure the safety of the traveling public, to minimize the long-term costs to taxpayers,
and to mitigate negative impacts on water quality through design.
B. Establish a process by which highways are to be laid out, altered, classified,
reclassified, discontinued, or accepted by the Town of Windsor.
C. Establish a process by which town rights-of-way are managed and maintained.
D. Establish standards and a process by which access to the town highways may be
granted.
E. Establishes standards and a process by which the town may permit excavation
within or under a town highway right-of-way.
This ordinance is intended to establish procedures and standards for regular functions related to
the town highways in the Town of Windsor. Not all circumstances and requests relating to town
highways are covered under this ordinance. The selectboard will address special circumstances
after review of professional standards, legal council, or other appropriate source as necessary to
determine the appropriate course of action to follow.3
1.03 SCOPE OF ORDINANCE
This ordinance shall apply to all existing and proposed town highways within the Town of
Windsor.
Town highways are only such as are (1) laid out in manner as prescribed in state statute; (2)
conveyed to and accepted by the Town of Windsor for public use; (3) dedicated to public use and
accepted by the Town of Windsor; or (4) laid out by the Town of Windsor for public use. [19
V.S.A. §1(12)]
2 The general purpose of this ordinance is to address the basic construction of town highways. Other ordinances may be required for
managing the safety and efficient functioning of town highways. This ordinances does not address regulating weight limits,
establishing speed limits or naming roads. Zoning and subdivision bylaws/regulations address construction standards for roads
outside of town rights-of-way, including private roads; and accesses from private roads.
3 Special circumstances, such as the process or provisions of eminent domain and taking of property for creation of new public
highways are not discussed in this ordinance. These are considered rare and special circumstances and will proceed on a case by case
basis following a thorough legal review. Certain standards, such as those for the village street system, may have additional
engineering to accommodate other objectives including traffic calming, sidewalks and on-street parking.
2
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
Included in the definition of highway are “rights-of-way, bridges, drainage structures, signs,
guard rails, areas to accommodate utilities authorized by law to locate within highway limits,
areas used to mitigate the environmental impacts of highway construction, vegetation, scenic
enhancements and other structures.” [19 V.S.A. §1(12)]
This ordinance does not address private roads and driveways, recreation paths, bicycle paths, and
trails which are outside of the typical highway right-of-way.4 This ordinance also does not
address routine maintenance policy such as snow and ice removal; regulating weight limits,
establishing speed limits, naming roads, repaving schedules, road inventories or capital budgets.
1.04 DESIGNATION OF EFFECT
This ordinance shall be designated as a civil ordinance in accordance with 24 V.S.A. §1971(b).
1.05 SEVERABILITY
If any portion of this ordinance is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
finding shall not invalidate any other part of this ordinance.
1.06 CONFORMANCE WITH OTHER REGULATIONS
The adoption of this ordinance shall not repeal any permit previously issued. All other
applicable local, state and federal regulations shall apply. Where there are inconsistencies
between regulations, the more stringent regulations shall apply.
1.07 AMENDMENTS

ARTICLE 4. SURVEY PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
4.01 SURVEYING OF EXISTING AND PROPOSED HIGHWAYS AND RIGHTS-OFWAY
The town may authorize the survey of existing highways and the rights-of-way, easements or fee
title associated with those highways.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the survey shall be to verify the location and width of
the existing right-of-way, easement, or fee title and to determine the extent of the
interest of the public in the title.
B. Notice of intent. A notice of the intent to survey an existing highway shall be
sent to all known abutting landowners by certified mail.
C. Factual basis of the survey. The survey shall be carried out in accordance with
the provisions of Chapter 45 of Title 26, Vermont State Statutes.
In performance of the survey, the town shall attempt to determine from all
available evidence, the type of highway, its location on the ground, its width, and
the record title holder. The survey shall be based on all available evidence
including, but not limited to, survey descriptions, original survey bills, plats,
plans, maps, photographs, discontinuances, court documents, public service board
orders, actions by the Selectboard, existing monumentation, present road location,
nearby intersections, topography, vegetation, past and current use patterns and
other additional information generally relied on by land surveyors. [19 V.S.A.
§33(b)]
If during the performance of the survey process under this section, the location, or
limits, or both of the right-of-way, easement, or fee title cannot be determined on
the ground from the available evidence, the town may instead cause a survey to be
made of the centerline of the existing traveled way and a width of one and onehalf
rods on each side of the centerline shall be assumed and controlled for
highway purposes. [19 V.S.A. §33(c)]
D. Required monumentation. Where a survey or re-survey has been ordered by the
selectboard, the limits of said right-of-way shall be monumented in accordance
with the survey plat and in a manner that will allow its limits to be readily
apparent to all adjacent property owners. Monumentation shall be permanent and
shall include not less than two intervisible monuments located on, within, or
adjacent to the highway limits. Intervisible monuments shall be at intervals of not
more than 200 meters. All monuments shall be referenced to the Vermont state
plane coordinate system in accordance with applicable statutes and standards in
effect. [19 V.S.A. §33(d)]
8
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
E. Notice of Completion. Notice of the completion of the survey shall be sent to all
known abutting landowners by certified mail, not less than 30 days before the
survey results are filed with the appropriate town clerk, together with notice of
statutory rights of appeal and damages. [19 V.S.A. §33(f)]
F. Recording survey plats. The town shall have the survey placed on record in the
town clerk’s office in each town in which the survey is performed. The record
shall include, but not be limited to, survey plats prepared and filed in accordance
with 27 V.S.A. §§1401-1406, a written description of the survey and an opinion
naming the record title holder. The description and plat shall include coordinates
referenced to the Vermont state plane coordinate system. All recorded or filed
material shall be indexed. [19 V.S.A. §33(e)]
Upon recordation of the survey and upon final disposition of statutory appeals, all
abutting and surrounding lands outside the limits of the survey shall be deemed
discontinued, unless any rights deemed necessary are expressly reserved and
clearly shown on the recorded survey plat. Title to the discontinued property shall
belong to the owners of the abutting lands. If it is located between the lands of
two different owners, it shall be returned to the lots to which it originally
belonged, if they can be determined; if not, it shall be equally divided between the
owners of the lands on each side. [19 V.S.A. §33(g)]
G. Damages. A property owner aggrieved by a survey may seek damages for the
loss of property or for the loss of interest in property through provisions
established in 19 V.S.A. §34 within 120 days from the date the results of the
survey are recorded in the town clerks office. [19 V.S.A. §33(h)]
ARTICLE 5. HIGHWAY STANDARDS
Highways vary in their functional use. The standards by which a highway is constructed are
important to its proper functioning. As the quantity of traffic on a highway changes the
standards must therefore change. Consequently, the standards that follow are considered
minimum standards and are subject to modification by the selectboard after a study of local
conditions requiring changes.
The selectboard reserves the right to modify the standards for a particular project, where, because
of unique physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the project can be
completed in strict conformance with these provisions. The selectboard may, at their discretion,
vary or waive these standards to meet special circumstances or where the standard is not
essential to the health, safety and welfare of the traveling public.
A number of resources were used to develop these standards. Where questions arise, these
manuals and specifications should be consulted. Other sources for specification standards
include the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) Highway Standards with specific
reference to A-76 and B-71, the Vermont State Standards for the Design of Transportation
9
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
Construction, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation on Freeways, Roads and Streets, the AASHTO
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, the Vermont Better Backroads Manual,
and the Vermont Local Roads Program Road Design and Maintenance Handbook and other
sources as referenced. The A-76 and B-71 standards have been reproduced in Appendix B of
this ordinance.
5.01 RIGHT-OF-WAY
A. Width. The minimum width of the right-of-way for trails and highways shall be
a minimum of 50-feet. Additional widths as deemed by the town may be
necessary based on site conditions. Rights-of-way may also be wider in village
areas to accommodate on-street parking , sidewalks or bike lanes.
Where the width of an existing right-of way is not known, a roadway width of one
and one half rods [24’9”] on each side of the center of the existing traveled way
can be assumed and controlled for highway or trail purposes. [19 V.S.A. §§32,
702]
B. Ownership. All newly accepted rights-of-way shall be transferred to the town in
fee simple and without encumbrances. Existing rights-of-way may be either
owned in fee or controlled by easement. Where status is not known the town
manager may order a survey to determine the extent of interest the town has in the
right-of-way.
C. Survey of right-of-way limits. Surveys of existing and proposed rights-of-way
are performed in accordance with the procedures laid out by state law.
D. Required monumentation. Monuments demarking the right-of-way limits shall
meet the standards established in state law.
E. Trees and Shrubs. The town tree warden (see 3.03) is empowered to provide for
the location, protection, maintenance and removal of shade trees, plants and
shrubs, and buildings or other structures on or above public highways, sidewalks
or other property of the municipality (24 V.S.A. §2291(3)). The town may enter
into agreements with individuals or organizations that wish to plant grasses,
shrubs, vines, trees or flowers within highway limits (19 V.S.A. §903). At no
point shall invasive species be planted along roadsides within the municipality.
The town may remove invasive species from within the road rights-of-way.
The highway department may remove all other trees or brush within the limits of
the highway which obstruct the view of the highway ahead or that cause material
damage to the highway or that are objectionable from a material or scenic
standpoint (19 V.S.A. §904). However, this power is subject to the following
limitations:
1. Shade or fruit trees set out by the adjoining landowners shall be
10
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
preserved if the usefulness or safety of the highway is not
impaired. [19 V.S.A. §904]
2. Young trees standing at a proper distance from the road bed and
from each other, and banks and hedges of brushes that serve as
protection to the highway or add beauty to the roadside shall be
preserved. [19 V.S.A. §904]
3. Unless otherwise provided a public shade tree may not be cut or
removed, in whole or in part, except by a tree warden or deputy
tree warden, or with the written permission of the tree warden [24
V.S.A. §2508]
No person, other than the abutting landowner, may cut, trim, remove or otherwise
damage any grasses, shrubs, vines or non shade trees growing in the right-of-way
of a town highway without permission of the town manager or town manager’s
designee. [19 V.S.A. §901] Shade trees are protected as stated above.
F. Following any disturbance of the soil along the roadsides, suitable revegetation of
the exposed soil shall take place to prevent erosion. Ditching should be done in
late summer.
5.02 ROAD FOUNDATION
For all new town highways the following minimum standards should be met:
A. The dimensions below are intended for low traffic volume conditions (<250
ADT) and where heavy truck traffic is infrequent. Where heavy trucks are
common or increased traffic is expected, an engineering assessment should be
performed to determine appropriate thickness of subbase and surface treatment.
B. Subgrade. Ledge and boulders shall be removed to at least 18 inches below
subgrade and replaced with sand or bank run gravel.
All loam, muck, stumps and other improper foundation material shall be removed
from within the limits of the fully extended road shoulders. In embankment areas,
suitable foundation material shall be placed in one-foot layers and compacted to
form a stable subgrade.
The subgrade surface shall conform exactly in cross section to the finished road
surface. Crowning and banking of curves shall be required. Compaction is
required on any portion of the subgrade which has been disturbed by excavation
or which has been filled during the construction of the subgrade. All ditches and
drains will be constructed so that they effectively drain the subgrade prior to the
placement of any base material. An additional 6 inches of sand cushion shall be
placed over any clay subgrade.
C. Wet areas. If the proposed roadway is in an unprotected wet area, the town may
11
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
require additional gravel plus sand cushion and underdrains or other methods to
insure a stable road.
D. Subbase. The subbase shall be composed of 12 inches of compacted crushed
gravel installed in two 6-inch lifts with maximum stone size of 4 inches. The
cross section of the subbase shall conform to those of the finished surface.
E. Upper base. All highways shall be constructed with a 6-inch upper base of
course compacted crushed gravel as defined by the Vermont Standard
Specifications for Construction.
5.03 ROADWAY CROWN
A. Paved. The travel lane shall have a cross slope, from centerline to edge of the
traveled lane, of ¼ inch per foot (48:1, 2.1% slope). The road shoulder, if present,
shall have a cross slope of ¾ inch per foot (16:1, 6.3% slope). Paved roads
generally will be constructed with a parabolic (rounded) shape to the crown.
B. Gravel. The road shall have a cross slope from centerline to edge of shoulder of
½ inch per foot (24:1, 4.2% slope). Gravel roads generally will be constructed
with an “A” shaped crown.
C. Super-elevation slopes for either paved or gravel roadways shall be a maximum of ¾
inch per foot for class 3 highways (16:1, 6.3% slope). Super elevation slopes must be
specifically designed for roadways based on geometry and expected speeds. A
qualified professional engineer should verify the amount of super-elevation on any
proposed highway.
5.04 PAVING
A. Town policy on paving roadways.6 The following standards shall be considered
by the Selectboard in determining what road finishing and surfacing will be
required as a condition of road acceptance or upgrade.
1. Arterial and collector highways will normally require pavement.
Non-arterial and non-collector highways will not normally require
paving, although may require paving based on certain factors,
including steep grades, traffic volumes or truck traffic.
2. Paving generally is required for highways expected to handle
greater than 400 vehicles per day.7
6 It is not always beneficial to the town to pave roadways that are proposed for acceptance. Paved highways may be more expensive
to maintain in the future than gravel roadways. The Selectboard may choose some, all, or none of these possible policies or may
decide other standards. See also Vermont Local Roads Program Fact Sheet When to Pave a Gravel Road and VLCT’s Vermont
Local Roads Model Highway Ordinance.
7 The Selectboard may elect to use a lower or higher threshold for paving. Vermont Local Roads Program mentions figures from as
low as 50 vehicles per day to 400-500 vehicles per day as a point where traffic starts to degrade roads to a point where paving should
12
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
3. The rural or urban characteristics of the neighborhood in which the
highway is located shall be considered. The Selectboard will be
guided by prevailing characteristics of the surrounding area and
public comment as well as the proposed development in deciding
whether to require paving a roadway.8
4. Safety to the traveling public and inhabitants along the highway
shall be considered in deciding whether to require paving a
proposed road and the extent and form of pavement to be required.
Roads proposed to have grades of 7 percent or more should be
paved.
5. Future foreseeable connection or intensification of a proposed road
shall be considered in determining whether and when to require
pavement and what form or location of pavement, or finishing
requirements.
6. Costs of construction and maintenance, and whether the paved
roadway is more economical than gravel.9
B. Paving process. Roadways to be paved shall be operated as a gravel road for a
period of at least one year prior to paving. The highway to be paved shall be
inspected periodically during the year to determine the quality of the base and
drainage. Once all weak spots have been identified and repaired, the road can be
prepared for paving. Prior to paving, a new layer of gravel base is required that
meets paving standards established by the State Department of Transportation.10
C. Paving standards. Paving shall be hot bituminous concrete mix meeting all of
Vermont State Highway specifications. The bituminous concrete is to be laid and
rolled by experienced crews in two layers. The first, the binder course, to a depth
compacted to 2 inches and the second application compacted to a depth of 1 ½
inches of hot bituminous concrete, surface mix. All work shall be done in a
professional manner.
1. Where heavy trucks are common or increased traffic expected a
pavement design should be performed to determine appropriate
thickness of subbase and pavement.
5.05 TRAVEL LANE WIDTH (See section 3.6 Town of Windsor Subdivision
Regulations.)
be considered. If gravel roads are maintained in ideal roadway conditions some research suggests gravel roads can support up to 900-
1000 vehicles per day (Zoning Practice, Issue 2, February 2004).
8 The Selectboard may elect to insert a district or area to define paving limits such as ‘All roads within the village shall be paved.’
9 Formulas have been produced for estimating costs (see Vermont Local Roads Program Fact Sheet When to Pave a Gravel Road)
or a detailed estimate can be calculated based on specific site considerations.
10 There is a substantial difference in the type of gravel used for a gravel road surface versus that used for base under pavement (see
Vermont Local Roads Program Fact Sheet When to Pave a Gravel Road and Soils for Road Work for details).
13
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
5.06 SLOPES AND BANKS
A. Vertical or sharp cut faces, excepting ledge, shall not be permitted. Vermont
Agency of Transportation Highway Standards A-60, A-61, and A62 should be
referred to for ledge and slopes in rock excavations.
B. Side slopes and banks shall strive to be no greater than 1 vertical to 3 horizontal
(4 inches/foot, 33% slope) but may be allowed as steep as 1 vertical to 1 ½
horizontal if necessary. Soil stability of banks shall be a design consideration.
Slopes and banks shall be designed and constructed to prevent instability, slides,
washes or other disturbance to the slope or bank surface or subsurface. Banks
shall not interfere with snow removal. After construction and final grading of
banks, banks will be seeded and mulched to minimize surface erosion.
Geotextiles, cribbing, riprap or other techniques shall be provided where
necessary.
C. Guard rails. Guard rails of treated wood or steel shall be provided in accordance
with Vermont Agency of Transportation specifications and standards. An
additional 3-foot widening is recommended for proper support of guard rail posts
at the outside of shoulders. Guard rails should not encroach upon shoulders
where bicycling use is common. Where slopes are 2:1 or steeper (6 inches/foot,
50% slope) and the height of drop-off at the edge of shoulder exceeds 5 feet,
guard rail should be installed. Where slopes are 3:1 (4 inches/foot, 33% slope),
guard rail may not be needed if the area at the bottom of the slope is free of
hazards. Where slopes are 4:1 (3 inches/foot, 25% slope) or flatter, guard rail is
not normally required.
5.07 DITCHES
A. Drainage ditches. Drainage ditches shall be provided where necessary and shall
be constructed to prevent infiltration of water into the gravel sub-base and to
conduct storm drainage to absorption areas. Underdrains will be required where
soil and water conditions make it desirable.
B. Ditch lining. Treatments vary depending on the slope of the ditch:
1. 0-2.5% slopes - grass lining (seeded and mulched)
2. 2.5-5% slopes – fabric liner, seeded and mulched. See figures IV-
14 and 15.
3. 5-10% slopes - R#3 (2-6 inch) diameter rock, 7.5 inches thick. See
figures IV-16 and 17.
4. >10% slopes- R#4 (3-12 inch) diameter rock, 12 inches thick.
C. Ditch shape. Ditch walls and side slopes shall be a maximum of 2 horizontal to 1
vertical ratio. The ditch bottom should be flat (parabolic-shaped preferred) and at
least 2 feet wide.
14
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
D. Depth of ditch. Drainage ditches next to roadways are normally to be at least 6
inches below the gravel sub-base or 18 inches below finished grade.
E. Outlet requirements. All ditches require an outlet away from the road
preferably an overland area where runoff can be absorbed into the soil.11
F. Other requirements. The town may require other velocity control devises such
as stone dikes, hay bale dikes, silt fence dikes and log and brush check dams as
necessary to protect the road and neighboring waterways.
Best management practices shall be followed at all times. The following
references should be used as guidance: Road Design and Maintenance Handbook
(VT Local Roads, 1999) and Vermont Better Backroads Manual (George D.
Aiken & Northern Vermont Resource Conservation and Development Councils,
2002).
Where a drop inlet is needed for a ditch drain, the Vermont Agency of
Transportation Highway Standards D-3 should be consulted for specifications.
G. Storm sewers. Where curbed and paved streets are proposed the Selectboard
may require installation of storm sewers. Storm sewers shall be constructed in
accordance with Vermont Agency of Transportation Highway Standards
including, but not limited to, D-1 – D-17.
5.08 CULVERTS AND HEADERS
A. Culverts are closed conduits used to convey water from one area to another
usually from one side of a road to the other. (Culverts greater than 6 feet in
diameter are considered bridges by VTrans.)
B. Culverts shall be installed during the construction of the highway and prior to
highway sub-base and surface preparation and placement. Backfill in excavations
for culverts shall be compacted to prevent or minimize settling in surface,
shoulders or slopes. Culverts should be covered with a minimum of 12 inches of
material except for plastic culverts which require a minimum of 18 inches of
cover.
Driveway culverts are addressed under Article 9 Driveway and Highway Access
Standards.
C. Culvert locations. Culverts shall be installed no more than 300 feet apart in one
continuous ditch line, where there are existing water channels crossing the road,
and wherever needed to control the volume and velocity of water. Where ditch
11 State storm water permits may require specific technologies including the creation of settling ponds.
15
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
slopes are between 3 and 10%, culverts should be installed every 150 feet. Where
slopes exceed 10%, culverts should be installed every 100 feet.
When crossing a stream, select a culvert site so that there is no sudden increase or
decrease gradient and there is a 50 foot straight alignment of the stream channel
directly above the crossing.
D. Culvert alignment. Ditch relief culverts should be installed at an angle of 60
degrees or less relative to the road centerline.
Stream crossing culverts should not be less than 45 degrees from centerline and is
preferred to cross at 90 degrees. Wherever possible align culvert with stream
channel.
E. Culvert slopes. Culverts shall have a minimum slope of 0.5% to allow for a
positive drainage flow.
F. Culvert material and shape. Culverts may be steel, aluminum, plastic or
concrete depending on the situation. Plastic is the most common material used for
smaller culverts. Larger pipe culverts are typically steel, and may be circular,
pipe arc, elliptical or multi-plate. Box-culverts are generally concrete. Where
questions arise, a qualified professional should be consulted to determine the
appropriate material and shape.
G. Sizing culverts. All culverts shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter
(assuming a corrugated plastic pipe culvert), or of similar flow capacity if using a
different material. Culverts for small watersheds (less than 20 acres) may be
sized by adding the acreage of the watershed to “8” then rounded up to the next
culvert size (example: a 15 acre watershed would use a 24 inch culvert: 15 + 8 =
23 inches, then rounded to 24 – the next culvert size).
For watersheds greater than 20 acres, the Town should request a hydraulics study
from the VT Agency of Transportation or consult with a qualified hydrology
professional for adequate sizing and design of the culvert. All culverts should be
sized to pass a 25-year design storm without over topping the road.
H. Headwalls and end sections. Headers shall be installed at the inlet of all culverts
and may be either reinforced concrete eight inches thick, large flat rock tightly
placed, or large cemented rock. The inside edge of headers shall be at least eight
feet from the edge of the shoulder. The outside of the header should be flush with
the end of the culvert. Marker posts four to six inches in diameter shall be
installed at both ends of the culvert.
End sections shall not be used in any year round stream. Where end sections are
required, an appropriately designed end section to prevent piping shall be
installed.
16
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
I. Fish friendly design. When crossing a stream, a culvert installation should not
change the conditions of the stream that existed prior to the installation. Contact
the state fisheries biologist for assistance with all stream crossings.
J. Outlets. All culvert outlets should be protected from erosion and undermining by
use of rock aprons, plunge pools or slope drain sediment basins. Culverts should
outlet to a vegetated area – never directly into a stream.
K. Splash pads, check dams, beaver fences and trash racks. The Town of
Windsor
may require splash pads, check dams, beaver fences or trash racks as necessary to
protect the road and neighboring waterways.
5.09 BRIDGES
A. New bridge crossings shall be discouraged. However, if no other feasible option
exists to access lands or development, new bridges or culverts greater than 6 feet
in diameter may be allowed.
B. Plans for bridges must be submitted for review prior to construction.
Construction will be authorized only after a review by VTrans which indicates
that the bridge will meet all applicable VTrans Specifications.
C. Before any new bridges are constructed, the town or developer shall investigate
options to access a site from an existing bridge. In order to reduce future
maintenance costs, the Town’s policy is to minimize the number of bridges in
town.
D. At a minimum, all bridges should be sized for a 25-year design storm.
E. When accepting a new right of way or portion of a right of way the town may
decline to accept bridges or require surety bond for their maintenance, upkeep or
replacement.
5.10 TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES
A. All newly accepted highways shall have traffic control devices in accordance with
the Manual on Uniformed Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Surety bond for
maintenance, upkeep or replacement may be required.
5.11 UTILITIES
A. Telegraph and telephone lines, electric wires and two way wireless
telecommunication facilities may be constructed and maintained in the highway
17
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
right-of-way as long as the activity does not interfere with the use and
maintenance of the highway or interfere with the protection or preservation of
shade trees or scenic values. [30 V.S.A. §2502]
Other utilities that may be permitted within the right-of-way include, but are not
limited to: water, sewer and stormwater infrastructure, and cable television
facilities.
B. In order to ensure that the activity does not interfere with the use and maintenance
of the highway, including the protection of and preservation of shade trees and
scenic values, the Selectboard may require some or all of these utilities to be
buried within the right-of-way. The developer shall coordinate with the
appropriate utility companies to insure adequate and suitable area and standards
for underground installations. The developer shall be responsible for providing
for water mains, manholes, sanitary sewers, and all other infrastructure necessary
for the proper management of the facilities.
C. As-built locations of all buried utilities are required on all final surveys prior to
recording.
5.12 PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES (See section 3.6 Town of Windsor Subdivision
Regulations.)
5.13 HIGHWAY LOCATION AND GEOMETRY (See section 3.6 Town of Windsor
Subdivision Regu;ations.)
ARTICLE 6. ACCEPTING A PRIVATE ROAD AS A TOWN HIGHWAY
6.01 ACCEPTING A PRIVATE ROAD (OR PRIVATE RIGHT-OF-WAY) AS A
TOWN HIGHWAY
A. Applicability. The acceptance of a highway by the municipality means the
receipt of the right-of-way needed for a new highway. In most cases this includes
the acceptance of the completed roadway as well.
B. Town objectives. Considering the effort and cost to maintain the existing town
highway network, it is the policy of the Town of Windsor not to accept new town
highways. However, in some cases it may be appropriate to do so. Therefore, the
selectboard will entertain any applications for the acceptance of public highways
and rights-of-way, and to adopt and adhere to an orderly procedure for the receipt
of and process to act upon such an application. The decision of an application for
acceptance of a highway or right-of-way is reserved to the sole and absolute
discretion of the selectboard who will consider the grant or denial of an
application on the basis of whether the public good, necessity, convenience and
the best interest of all inhabitants of the town require it.
18
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
The Town of Windsor will consider applications to accept highways in one of two
conditions: 1) Only the right-of-way is transferred to the town and it is classified
as a trail, or 2) A completed roadway is built to town standards. (see Section
8.01- Application to Lay Out or Alter Highways).
C. Initiating proceedings. The acceptance of a highway is initiated through one of
two means: 1) By a motion of the Selectboard; or 2) By petition filed by persons
who are either voters or landowners and whose number is at least five percent of
the voters in the Town of Windsor (19 V.S.A. §708(a)).
The petition or motion shall state clearly the extent and intended classification of
the highway to be accepted (e.g. “...to accept, as a class 3 highway, Lonely Lane
from the intersection with town highway #10 for a distance of 0.32 miles west”).
D. Application process. Applications for final consideration must include a
proposed plat and documentation as described below. In the case of accepting a
roadway, final consideration will only occur after the road has been fully
constructed and in use as a private street for a period of not less than 12 months.
1. A survey to be made in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of this
Ordinance and 19 V.S.A. §33 shall mark the termination of the survey by
a permanent monument or boundary or refer the termination or survey by
course and distance, to some permanent monument. This survey shall
describe the highway and the right-of-way by courses, distances and
width, and shall describe the monuments and boundaries [19 V.S.A.
§704].
2. Documentation includes copies of all local and state permits regarding the
creation of the road and/or right-of-way. As built drawings shall be
submitted identifying all above and belowground utilities, signs, etc.
E. Notice and hearing. The Selectboard shall promptly appoint a time and date
both for examining the premises and a hearing of interested persons. Notice shall
be sent by certified mail, at least 30-days in advance, to all persons owning land
through which the highway may pass or abut. At least 10 days before the set time
for the hearing, notice shall be provided to the Municipal Planning Commission in
which the road is being proposed, notice shall be posted in the Town Clerks
Office, and shall be posted in a newspaper of general circulation. (19 V.S.A.
§709)
F. Review standards. All roadways proposed for acceptance by the Town of
Windsor must meet the minimum standards established in Article 6 and any
Highway Acceptance Policies adopted by the municipality. The Selectboard
retains the right to deny acceptance of any proposed roadway for any reason,
contained or not contained within this Ordinance.
19
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
G. Decisions. Within sixty days of examining the premises and hearing any
interested parties, the Selectmen shall return the petition with a report of their
findings and a decision to either deny the application or formally accept the
highway, or portions thereof, by resolution of the Selectboard.
H. Recording requirements. The clerk shall record the order accepting the road
and the plat describing the new highway. The final plat shall also be attested by
signature of the chair of the Selectboard and recorded in the Town Clerk’s Office.
ARTICLE 7. LAY OUT, ALTER, RECLASSIFY, OR DISCONTINUE A
TOWN HIGHWAY
7.01 APPLICATION TO LAY OUT, ALTER , RECLASSIFY OR DISCONTINUE HIGHWAY
A. Town objectives. The Town of Windsor shall entertain applications to layout,
alter, reclassify or discontinue highways and trails when the proposed changes are
in the public good, necessity and convenience of the inhabitants of the
municipality. The decision of an application to lay out, alter, reclassify or
discontinue a highway or trail is reserved to the sole and absolute discretion of the
selectboard who will consider the grant or denial of an application on the basis of
whether the public good, necessity, convenience and the best interest of the
inhabitants of the town require it.
B. Initiating proceedings. The laying out, alteration, reclassification or
discontinuance of a highway or trail is initiated through one of two means: 1) By
a motion of the selectboard; or 2) By a petition filed by persons who are either
voters or landowners and whose number is at least five percent of the voters in the
Town of Windsor (19 V.S.A. §708(a)).
C. Preliminary meeting. In an effort to minimize costs to the applicant and
municipality, a preliminary review of the application shall take place. The
purpose of the preliminary meeting is to clarify issues in controversy, identify
documents, plans, detailed information that should be submitted as evidence at a
hearing, and to circumvent untimely and unnecessary delays that would interfere
with the public hearing process.
Where the selectboard is not inclined to lay out or alter a highway, the board may
reject the application prior to investment in surveys and other costs. Decisions by
the Selectboard to proceed in the application process does not guarantee
acceptance and the applicant does not gain any vested interest. Approval of a
subdivision road by the Planning Commission also does not guarantee acceptance
of that road as a town highway.
D. Application process. When the selectboard lays out or alters a highway, as
provided herein, they shall cause a survey to be made in accordance with the
20
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
provisions of Article 4 of this Ordinance and shall mark the termination of the
survey by a permanent monument or boundary or refer the termination or survey
by course and distance, to some permanent monument. This survey shall describe
the highway and the right-of-way by courses, distances and width, and shall
describe the monuments and boundaries. [10 V.S.A. §704]
E. Notice and hearings. The selectboard shall promptly appoint a time and date
both for examining the premises and a hearing of interested persons. Notice shall
be sent by certified mail, at least 30-days in advance, to all persons owning land
through which the highway may pass or abut. At least 10 days before the set time
for the hearing, notice shall be provided to the Municipal Planning Commission.
Notice shall be posted in the town clerks office, and shall be posted in a
newspaper of general circulation. (19 V.S.A. §709)
F. Review standards. The selectboard shall judge whether the public good,
necessity and convenience of the inhabitants of the town require it. 19 VSA 701
and 501.
All highways to be laid out or altered by the Town of Windsor must meet the
minimum standards established in Article 5. Where an existing highway does not
meet minimum standards established in Article 5 and altering it to meet full
compliance is not reasonable, the proposed altered highway must at least be as
compliant as the original highway.
G. Decisions. Within 60 days of the hearing, the selectboard must return the original
petition with a report on its findings and, if necessary, a completed survey (19
V.S.A. §711(a)).
H. Recording requirements. The selectboard’s order laying out, altering,
reclassifying or discontinuing with the survey shall be recorded by the town clerk
19 V.S.A. §711(a)).
ARTICLE 8. DRIVEWAY & HIGHWAY ACCESS STANDARDS
8.01 HIGHWAY ACCESS PERMIT PROCEDURES
A. Applicability. Under 19 V.S.A. 1111(b), the Selectboard has the authority to
regulate the construction standards of accesses onto public roads within Town
rights-of-way, and drainage into the Town rights-of-way. Any new access or
change in an existing access onto a town highway must receive an access permit
from the town manager or designee. Access permits regulate the location, design
and construction of the access as it affects the Town right-of-way.
A state permit is required for any new access onto a state highway or any work
within state rights-of-way.
The Development Review Board has the authority to regulate the location and
21
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
design of those portions of accesses outside of the Town rights-of-way. Any new
access or change in access must also receive approval from the Development
Review Board pursuant to the Town of Windsor Subdivision Regulations. The
Development Review Board also has the authority to regulate accesses from
private roads pursuant to the subdivision regulations.
B. Town objectives. The purpose of these standards is to ensure safe and efficient
entrances and exits from public highways, provide adequate emergency vehicle
access to properties, to reduce damage from flood events, to mitigate erosion and
storm water runoff impacts, and to ensure quality construction of driveway and
road accesses.
C. Initiating proceedings. An application for a highway access permit shall be
submitted to the road commissioner at least seven days prior to the anticipated
construction. No construction shall take place until the town has issued a
highway access permit.
D. Review standards. All accesses shall meet standards established in Section 8.02
of these regulations.
E. Decisions. The town manager shall review and issue access permits in instances
where the application meets all applicable standards below. The town manager
may seek input from town department heads before issuing an access permit.
Where an application is denied the applicant can appeal the decision to the select
board.
F. Recording requirements. To become effective all access permits shall be
recorded in the town clerk’s office where other land use permits are filed.
8.02 HIGHWAY ACCESS STANDARDS
These highway access standards establish minimum standards for location, design, construction,
and maintenance of driveway accesses and highway intersections. These standards apply to the
portions of these accesses and intersections that fall within the town rights-of-way and those
other portions of accesses that may drain storm waters into the town rights-of-way.
A. Reasonable Access.
1. The Selectboard cannot deny reasonable access to an abutting public
highway. This is a judgment the Selectboard has to make balancing the
individual’s right for access with the safety of the traveling public. Among
other things, reasonable access includes considering alternate driveway
locations, sharing of a right-of-way with others, limiting the use of the
property (in conjunction with zoning), and requiring additional
engineering and construction.
22
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
2. Certain conditions may make reasonable access impossible (e.g. a
landlocked parcel or where all road frontage is a class 2 wetland). It is not
the responsibility of the Selectboard to obtain or remedy a lack of frontage
or access for a property owner.
B. Design Standards. (See section 3.6 Town of Windsor Subdivision
Regulations.)
C. Access Construction Standards.
1. Foundation. Portions of driveways within the limits of the right-of-way
shall have a minimum of 12 inches of sub-base material. Non-residential
driveways shall have 18 inches of sub-base materials, or greater depths
required to carry the expected vehicle and truck traffic.
2. Upper Base. Gravel accesses should have a minimum aggregate surface
course of four inches. Paved accesses should have a minimum of three
and one-half inches of bituminous concrete pavement (two inch base, and
one and one-half inch wearing surface).
3. Roadway Crown and Side Slope.
a. Paved accesses shall have a cross slope from centerline to edge of
travel lane, of ¼ inch per foot.
b. Gravel accesses shall have across slope from centerline to edge of
shoulder of ½ inch per foot.
c. The cross slope of the shoulder, if present, shall be ¾ inch per foot.
d. No runoff shall flow to right-of-way.
What about down slope runoff to highway?
4. Paved Apron. Where a gravel drive or highway is accessing a paved
highway, a paved apron at least 10 feet in length is required.
5. Culverts and Headers.
a. Driveway culverts shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter, or
be of sufficient diameter/flow capacity to handle 25-year flood
events.
b. See Section 6.09 Minimum Highway Standards – Culverts and
Headers for additional construction details.
c. Culverts under driveways and access roads should be placed away
from the road as far as practical while maintaining good drainage.
6. Drainage Ditches. Drainage ditches shall be provided where necessary
23
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
and shall be constructed to prevent infiltration of water into the gravel subbase
and to conduct storm drainage to water retention or absorption areas.
See Section 5.08 Minimum Highway Standards – Ditches for additional
construction details.
8.03 MAINTENANCE
All roads, driveways and driveway aprons shall be maintained in a safe and passable condition,
and drainage ditches, culvert and bridges shall be maintained in a functional and structurally
sound condition. Such maintenance is the sole responsibility of the applicant or other individual
or entity as legally established pursuant to the access permit. A recorded maintenance agreement
or neighborhood association agreement shall be established for all lots with shared access
driveways or roads.
Regular maintenance of drainage ditches within town rights-of-way shall be the responsibility of
the town highway department. However, damage to the town drainage ditches or structures
resulting from poorly constructed or maintained accesses, shall be the responsibility of the
owner.
ARTICLE 9. RIGHT-OF-WAY EXCAVATION PERMIT
9.01 Right-of-way Excavation Permit
A. Applicability. No one shall disturb the ground or pavement in any town highway
or access without first obtaining a written permit from the town manager or
his/her designee. Where an excavation is limited to construction of a driveway
access, the rules and regulations for access permits shall apply.
B. Town objectives. The Town of Windsor shall protect its investment and
ownership of the highway system through regulation of any development within
the highway right-of-way.
C. Application process. Applications for an excavation permit or for improvements
to unimproved portions of the public right-of-way shall be made on forms
furnished by the Town of Windsor.
D. Emergencies. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the making of
excavation as may be necessary for the preservation of life or property, provided
that the person making such excavation shall apply for a permit on the first
working day after such excavation is commenced. Even in emergency situations,
notice shall be given by phone to the highway department and police department.
All provisions of the article shall apply to such emergency.
E. General conditions of permit approval.
1. All work shall be conducted by a professional contractor. The contractor
24
Windsor Ordinance-Title 11
shall supply a current certificate of insurance before work commences.
The contractor shall have proof of general liability coverage in a minimum
amount of $500,000.00. This insurance shall include coverage for owned,
non-owned and hired vehicles. The town manager or their designee will

Windsor Ordinance – Title 14 1
TITLE 14 - PLACEMENT OF COIN-OPERATED NEWSPAPER VENDING
MACHINES
Chapter 1 - Purpose and Intent1
The Town of Windsor, Vermont is a commercially active but small community which
possesses a natural beauty and an historic character which has long been recognized by its
residents and others. Its economic base is substantially supported by that recognition and the
tourism it generates. A large number of properties located in the Town are listed on both the
National and State Registers of Historic Places. The commercial center of the Town is located
wholly within a designated historic area. In addition, it is also intersected by a major U.S.
highway. As a result of the tourism and volume of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and currently
suffers from a shortage of designated parking.
The Town finds and declares that the uncontrolled placement and maintenance of coinoperated
newspaper vending machines (hereinafter referred to as "newsracks") on the public
right-of-way and the proliferation of such devices unreasonably interferes with and obstructs the
public use of such rights-of-way , creates an aesthetically displeasing situation, and is such an
obstruction of the free use of public property that it interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of
life and property by the entire community and others. The Town also finds, however, that the
use of such rights-of-way is so historically associated with he sale and distribution of newspapers
and publications that access to these areas should not be absolutely denied. The municipality
further finds and declares that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable
accommodation that can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this ordinance
designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place and manner of using such
newsracks.
The purpose of this ordinance is to regulate the placement, installation, design, and
maintenance of newsracks in public areas of the Town in order to further protect and preserve the
aesthetic and historic characteristics of the Town and its economic base, and, in general, to
promote the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its residents and others. It is a
further purpose of this ordinance to recognize and give adequate protection to the rights of
newspaper and news periodical owners to have their publications distributed.
___________________________
1 This section is adapted from both the Los Angeles County Ordinance and the
Woodstock Ordinance.
Chapter 2 - Definitions
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth herein:
A) "Newsrack" shall mean any coin-operated box, container, storage unit, or other
Windsor Ordinance – Title 14 2
dispenser installed, used, or maintained for the display and sale of newspapers or news
periodicals.
B) "Person" means any natural person, corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association, firm, municipality, governmental unit or other legal entity.
C) "Public area: means any area of the Village publicly owned or over which the public
has a legal right-of-way or easement for any roadways, sidewalks, parking areas, alleys, bridges,
parks, and fields.
D) "Sidewalk" means any public area which has been paved and set aside for the
exclusive use of pedestrians.
Chapter 3 - Use, Appearance and Dimensions of Newsracks2
All newsracks shall be used solely for the distribution of newspapers, magazines and
other printed materials and shall be maintained by the owner in a state of good repair and neat
appearance. No newsrack shall exceed five (5) feet in height, thirty (30) inches in width and two
(2) feet in depth.
Chapter 4 - Place Where Newsracks Not Permitted3
No newsrack shall be placed, installed, used or maintained:
A) on any portion of or projecting into or over any portion of the highway on which
vehicles are lawfully permitted;
B) within five (5) feet of any marked crosswalk;
C) within twenty (20) feet of any fire hydrant, fire call box, police call box or other

2 This section is adapted from the Minneapolis, Minn. Code s 451.20, reprinted in
Minneapolis Newspaper Ass'n, 9 Media L. Rep. (BNA) at 2128, and the Los Angeles City
Ordinance.
3 This section is adapted from the Los Angeles City Ordinance, and Yonkers, N.Y.,
Ordinance.
I) where the newsrack will endanger persons or property;
Windsor Ordinance – Title 14 3
J) where the newsrack will unreasonably interfere with or obstruct the flow of pedestrian
or vehicular traffic on the highway;
K) at any location whereby the clear space for the passage of pedestrians is reduced to
less than five (5) feet.
L) notwithstanding the above restrictions, the two newsracks now in place in front of the
U.S. Post Office, as presently sited, and any replacement(s) thereof which comply with Chapter
3, Section 301 above, shall be deemed to be in compliance with these placement requirements.
Chapter 5 - Registration and Identification of Newsracks4
Each newsrack must bear in a conspicuous place the identity of the owner. If the name,
address and telephone number of its owner is not readily and publicly available (e.g., from the
Vermont Secretary of State, or from a Vermont telephone directory), the newsrack must also
bear such information.
Chapter 6 - Sanctions for Violations of Chapters 3-5
A) Violations of Sections 3-4. Municipal officials will make all reasonable efforts to
correct any violations at the scene. If officials are unable to do so, the newsrack owner will be
notified that his newsrack is in violation of the ordinance. After notification, the owner will have
fifteen (15) business days either to bring his newsrack into compliance with the ordinance or to
contest the allegation. If he chooses to contest the alleged violation, an administrative hearing
will be scheduled. The newsrack will not be removed until after the owner has had an
opportunity to make a judicial appeal from the administrative hearing.5
_____________________
4 This section is strictly a bookkeeping device.
5 In an effort to ensure that these enforcement provisions pass constitutional muster, they
have been made extremely weak. Indeed, it would be a lengthy process before the town could
remove a newsrack, unless the newsrack posed an imminent danger. The regulatory provisions
of this ordinance are so reasonable, however, it is unlikely that a newsrack owner would ever go
to the time and expense of contesting a violation when he could easily fix it. The potential
exception to this rule, of course, is the owner who is contesting the constitutionality of the
regulatory provisions.
A newsrack will be summarily removed for violating Chapter 3 and 4 of this ordinance
only if the violation creates an imminent danger of personal injury or property damage. The
owner will be notified and may reclaim his impounded newsrack. An impoundment fee will be
assessed, but does not have to be paid before the owner can claim his newsrack. The fee can be
contested in court on the grounds that the newsrack was improperly seized.6
B) Violations of Chapter 5. If an owner has failed to put appropriate identification on his
newsrack, he will be notified and the violation will be treated in the same manner as a violation
of CHAPTERS 3 and 4.
If the owner has failed to place identification on the newsrack such that it is impossible to
notify the owner because it is impossible to identify him, his newsrack will be tagged and he will
Windsor Ordinance – Title 14 4
have at least one month to add such identification as is required to comploy with CHAPTER 5,
SECTION 501.
Chapter 7 - Agreement to Hold Harmless
Any person who installs, places, or maintains a newsrack in the Town of Windsor shall,
by such act or acts, be deemed to have agreed to defend (at the option of the Town ) indemnify
and hold harmless the Town, its officers, trustees, manager, agents, and employees, from and
against all claims, causes of action, suits, losses, and damages, including expenses, attorney's
fees, and costs, for bodily or personal injury and for property damage sustained by any person as
a result of the installation, placement, use, or maintenance of such rewsrack within the Town of
Windsor. A person who installs or places a newsrack in the Town of Windsor shall, within
fourteen (14) days of such installation or placement, file with the Town Manager a written
statement agreeing to so indemnify the Town of Windsor.
Chapter 8 - Severability
If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance
is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and for this purpose the
provisions of this chapter are severable.
_________________
6 This provision protects the municipality's right to remove newsracks posing an
imminent danger, and recover impoundment fees. It also, however, protects the newsrack owner
by letting him immediately recover the newsrack and contest the impoundment fee later. Of
course, the municipality sacrifices the advantage of insuring that it will receive fees properly
owned.

Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 1
ARTICLE 1. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
Section 1.0 Enactment
In accordance with the Vermont Planning and Development Act (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") 24 V.S.A., Chapter 117, Subchapter 6 7, Section §4411, there are hereby established Zoning Regulations for the Town of Windsor which are set forth in the following text and maps. These regulations shall be known as the "Town of Windsor Zoning Regulations", as amended through March 24, 2015.
Section 1.1 Purpose
The general purposes and goals set forth in the Act [§4302] (“...to encourage appropriate development of all lands in this state..." etc.) are hereby adopted by reference.
The specific purpose of these regulations is the implementation of the Windsor Town Plan by providing for the preservation of the historic development pattern of the mixed-use village surrounded by open land, agriculture, forest and low-density residential uses. These regulations seek to guide the development of Windsor for the protection of community health, safety, welfare, and quality of life, in conformance with the Windsor Town Plan.
Section 1.2 Application of Regulations
A zoning permit issued by the Administrative Officer shall be required for any land development as defined in the Act [§4303] except for development which is specifically exempted from these regulations under Article 6, Section 6.0 (B). Such permit may be issued only in conformance with these regulations and other Town ordinances, as provided in the Act [§ 4446]. Any use not permitted by these regulations shall be deemed prohibited.
Section 1.3 Interpretation
The adoption of these regulations shall not repeal any permit previously issued. Where these regulations impose a greater restraint or restriction than is provided under any other statute, bylaw, ordinance, rule or regulation, then these regulations shall govern.
Section 1.4 Adoption and Amendments; Effective Date
In accordance with the Act [§§4441 and 4412], these regulations shall take effect 21 days after adoption and may be amended according to the requirements and procedures established in the Act. The zoning regulations heretofore in effect (“Town of Windsor Zoning Bylaws, 1997”) shall be deemed repealed upon the effective date of these regulations. Any mandatory changes enacted by the state shall automatically become part of these regulations.
Section 1.5 Severability
The invalidity of any provision of these regulations shall not invalidate any other part.
“Land development" means the division of a parcel into two or more parcels, the construction, reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any building or other structure, or of any mining, excavation or landfill, and any change in the use of any building or other structure or land, or extension of use of land.” [§4303]
Page 2 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
ARTICLE 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND DISTRICT STANDARDS
Section 2.0 Establishment of Zoning Districts
For the purpose of these Regulations, the Town of Windsor is divided into the following zoning districts:
Resource -
RES
Village Mixed Use
VMU
Rural -
RUR
Roadside Business -
RB
Low Density Residential -
LDR
Industrial -
IND
Medium Density Residential -
MDR
Flood Hazard Overlay District -
FLD
High Density Residential -
HDR
Downtown Design Review Overlay District-
DDR
Central Business -
CB
Section 2.1 Zoning Map
(A) The location and boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on the official Zoning Maps of the Town of Windsor entitled "Town Zoning Map" and "Village Zoning Map". Flood Hazard Overlay District boundaries are shown on National Flood Insurance Maps for the Town of Windsor, which are adopted by reference to be part of these regulations. These maps are hereby declared to be a part of these regulations. Regardless of the existence of copies of the maps which may be made or published, the Official Zoning Maps located in the Town Office shall be the final authority as to current status of zoning district boundaries.
(B) The signatures of the Selectboard, as attested to by the Town Clerk, shall identify the official zoning maps. No changes of any nature shall be made on the official maps except in conformance with zoning amendment procedures and requirements set forth in the Act [§§4441-4442].
Section 2.2 Density and Lot Size Classification
In certain districts created by these Regulations, the lot size and/or density requirements vary depending on the availability of certain essential services. In the MDR and HDR districts, whether a lot is class "1", "2", or "3" depends on the availability of municipal water and sewer services to that lot. In the RUR district, whether the maximum density is Class "A" or "B" depends upon whether or not the parcel is part of a Planned Residential Development (PRD see Section 5.5). The classification system hereby established is as follows:
Lot Classification Provision for Water & Sewer Service
Class 1 Municipal Sewer and Municipal or Public Water
Class 2 Municipal Sewer and Individual water (on parcel source)
Class 3 Individual sewer and Individual, Public or Municipal Water
Class A PRD Lot (Section 5.5)
Class B Conventional Lot
The purpose of Class A is to allow for higher density development in outlying areas where it is suitable, if it is designed to conserve open spaces, cluster units and minimize the need for new capital improvements.
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 3
Section 2.3 Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries
(A) Using the following guidelines, the Administrative Officer shall determine the boundaries of the Zoning Districts:
(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following streets or highways, the centerlines of such street or highway rights-of-way shall be construed to be the boundary.
(2) Where two district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary.
(3) Where district boundaries are shown as paralleling streets or highways, such boundaries shall be construed as running parallel to the center lines of the rights-of-ways of such streets or highways at such distance therefrom as is indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map.
(4) Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such boundary shall be construed to be the middle of the main track of the railroad line.
(5) Where the boundary of a district follows a river, stream, lake, or pond, the boundary shall be construed to be the normal high water mark of the river, stream, lake, or pond.
(B) When the Administrative Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by the scale or dimensions given on the official zoning map or by the above rules, the Planning Commission may be consulted prior to making the final determination. Upon appeal from the decision of the Administrative Officer as to a boundary location, the Development Review Board shall make the necessary interpretation under Section 6.1.
Section 2.4 Application of District Standards
(A) The standards for each district apply uniformly to each class of use and/or structure, unless otherwise specified in these regulations. All uses and structures must comply with all prescribed standards for the district in which they are located as set forth in Tables 2.1 - 2.10, unless otherwise permitted under Planned Residential Development (PRD) or Planned Unit Development (PUD) pursuant to Section 5.5. Nonconforming uses and structures shall be regulated in accordance with Section 4.8.
(B) Additional Overlay Districts shall be applied concurrently with the standards for underlying districts. Where overlay districts impose more restrictive standards on the use of a structure or land, the standards of the overlay district shall apply.
(C) Uses for each district are classified as “permitted,” to be reviewed in accordance with Section 6.0, or “conditional” to be reviewed in accordance with Section 5.3.
Section 2.5 Zoning District Objectives, Uses and Specific Standards
Tables 2.1–2.10 set forth the stated purpose, allowable uses and specific standards for each zoning district.

No lot shall be so reduced in area that the area, yard, lot width, frontage, coverage or other requirements of this bylaw are less than the minimum herein prescribed for each district, except as permitted for Planned Unit or Planned Residential Development under Section 5.5.
(D) Required Lot and Yard Areas. In calculating the required area, width or depth of a lot, the area of existing and proposed road rights-of-way shall be excluded. Space required under this bylaw to satisfy yard, area, or other open space requirements in relation to one building shall not be counted as part of a required open space for any other building.
(E) Principal Structures/Uses. There shall only be one principal structure and/or use on a lot unless otherwise permitted as a Planned Unit Development or a Mixed Use in the relevant district.
(F) Corner Lots. Lots at an intersection of streets shall have the required frontage on one street and the yard adjoining this street shall be considered a front yard and shall meet minimum front yard requirements.
(G) Setbacks. The shortest distance between the exterior of a building, including covered terraces and projections thereof but excluding steps, uncovered patios and terraces, and the nearest adjacent boundary of the building lot. On public rights-of-way fifty (50) feet or more wide, the front setback shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way. On public rights-of-way of less than fifty (50) feet the front setback shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way On public rights-of-way of undetermined width, the front setback shall be measured from a line twenty-five (25) feet away from the centerline of the traveled portion of the roadway

Section 4.8 Nonconforming Uses and Structures
(A) Nonconforming Uses. Any nonconforming use of land, buildings or premises lawfully existing as of the effective date of this bylaw or of any pertinent amendment thereto, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
(1) No nonconforming use may be changed except to a conforming use, or with conditional use approval from the Development Review Board, to another non-conforming use no more objectionable in character.
(2) No nonconforming use shall, if once changed into a conforming use, be changed back again into a nonconforming use.
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 33
(3) No nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of one (1) year shall thereafter be resumed without conditional use approval from the Development Review Board.
(4) No nonconforming use shall be extended or expanded except with conditional use approval from the Development Review Board, which shall have determined that no greater detrimental effect upon the community or neighborhood will result.
(B) Non-conforming Structures. Nothing in this bylaw shall prevent the maintenance or improvement of a non-conforming structure provided such action does not increase the degree of non-conformance. Any non-conforming structure lawfully existing as of the effective date of this bylaw or of any pertinent amendment thereto, may be maintained indefinitely subject to the following conditions:
(1) No non-conforming structure shall be enlarged unless such enlarged portion conforms to the building requirements of this bylaw.
(2) No non-conforming structure which has been substantially damaged or destroyed to an extent more than 75% of its value as assessed by the town shall be reconstructed or replaced by another non-conforming structure except with conditional use approval from the Development Review Board, which shall have determined that no greater detrimental effect upon the community or neighborhood will result.
(C) Degree of Non-conformance. For the purposes of these regulations, an extension of the degree of non-conformance shall be interpreted as a further encroachment of the non-complying feature/element beyond that point which constitutes the greatest pre-existing (pre-zoning regulations) encroachment. An enlargement of the volume or area of a structure which does not comply with a building setback does not constitute an increase in the degree of non-conformance unless the enlargement encroaches further upon the non-conforming setback. For example, if a house encroaches ten (10) feet into a setback and an attached porch encroaches fifteen (15) feet into the same setback, the degree of noncompliance will only be increased by an encroachment of greater than 15 feet into the setback. Thus, a porch could be increased in size along the length of the house, or the living space of the house expanded to a 15 feet encroachment, without increasing the degree of non-conformance.
Section 4.9 Parking and Loading Requirements
(A) Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to:
(1) Ensure there are adequate parking and loading facilities to serve the use or uses of the property;
(2) Ensure that parking facilities are designed to provide proper circulation, reduce hazards to pedestrians, and protect the users of adjoining properties from nuisance caused by the noise, fumes, and glare of headlights which may result from the operation of vehicles parking off the street;
(3) Reduce congestion in the streets;
(4) Contribute to traffic safety; and,
(5) Encourage alternate modes of travel that will reduce dependence upon the single-occupancy automobile.
Page 34 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
(B) Applicability. No structure shall be erected or altered, or any use changed or established, unless or until the provisions of this Section have been met.
(C) Existing Structures.
(1) Any structure or land use lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall not be subject to the requirements of this Section as long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, and provided further that any parking facilities now serving such structures shall not in the future be reduced below such requirements.
(2) Change or Expansion of Use. Whenever there is an alteration or conversion of an existing structure or a change or expansion of an existing use which increases the parking requirements, the total additional parking requirements for the alteration, conversion, change, or expansion shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Section.
(D) Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements. Parking for all uses and structures shall be provided in accordance with Table 4.1.

(2) Where no requirement is designated and the use is not comparable to any of the listed uses, parking requirements shall be determined by the DRB upon recommendation by the administrative officer based upon the capacity of the facility and its associated uses.
(3) When the calculation yields a fractional number of required spaces, the number of spaces shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
(E) Parking Dimensional Requirements.
(1) Minimum parking space size shall be 9 feet by 18 feet. (Minor variations to accommodate property dimensions can be accepted if approved by DRB under Section 4.9(F)(9)).
(2) Acceptable dimensions for compact cars will be as established by the applicable and approved standard used on the project
(3) Requirement for access, aisle widths, backing and turning space as per accepted standards (e.g. VTrans, NASHTO, Graphic Standards, ANSI A117.1 & ADA). The application must specify which standard was used to layout the off-street parking lot dimensions.
(4) Minimize width and number of access points and curb cuts.
(F) Limitations, Location, Use of Facilities
(1) Off-Site Parking Facilities.
a) Except for single and two-family dwellings, required parking facilities may be located on another parcel of such that no more than 50% of the total required parking shall be provided at a distance greater than 500 feet from the use it is intended to serve, and shall be approved by the DRB as part of a parking management plan.
b) The distance from the off-site parking to the associated use shall be measured in walking distance along a sidewalk or other pedestrian path separated from street traffic from the nearest parking space to the principle pedestrian entrance to the building housing the use. Such off-site parking shall not reduce the required parking for any other use utilizing the property on which it is located unless such shared use is approved by the development review board. The right to use the off-site parking must be guaranteed for the duration of the use as evidenced by a deed, lease, easement, or similar written instrument as may be approved by the Town Attorney.
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 39
(2) Downtown Street Level Setback. In order to maintain an active streetscape, any off-street parking occupying street level frontage in the Designated Downtown District shall be setback from the front property line in order to reserve street-level frontage for pedestrian-oriented uses. Off-street parking shall be located to the side or rear of the building. Where that is not practicable, a landscaped buffer of sufficient width or treatment (i.e. plantings, fencing, etc.) shall be provided in order to screen the parking area from the public space along the roadway and sidewalk.
(3) Front Yard Parking Restricted. Required parking in the Designated Downtown District and the HDR District shall not be located in a required front yard setback area abutting a public street, except alleys. This prohibition extends from the edge of the public right-of-way into the required front yard setback for the entire width of the property with the exception of a single access drive no more than eighteen feet (18’) in width.
There shall be no parking between the principle structure and the front setback.
Where parking is provided outside the front yard setback, but either partially or entirely between the principle structure and the street, such parking shall be screened to the extent practicable from view from the public street.
(4) Shared Parking. In the event that a mix of uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirement for off-street parking shall be the sum for all individual uses unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are offset and spaces can be shared (for example: retail and residential, or theater and office uses).
(5) Availability of Facilities. Required parking pursuant to this Section shall be available for parking of operable passenger vehicles used by residents, customers and employees only, and shall not be used for the storage or display of vehicles or materials. The distribution of parking spaces for any and all individual uses will be required to be arranged in such a way as to ensure optimal access and use by the patrons of such use(s).
(6) Compact Car Parking. Compact parking spaces may be used in parking structures or lots. Up to fifteen (15%) percent of the total parking spaces may be designated for compact cars. Such spaces shall be signed or the space painted with the words “Compact Car Only”.

(8) Stacked and Tandem Parking Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided below, all parking facilities shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without the moving of any other motor vehicle.
Tandem Parking may be allowed for single family detached dwelling units, accessory apartments, duplex dwelling units, and dedicated employee-only parking signed as such. In no case shall more than 4 parking spaces (2 pairs) in total be provided in tandem on any one lot, except where both spaces are identified as for use by one individual unit.
(9) Parking Management Plans. Any application for development that is subject to review by the DRB shall submit a Parking Management Plan as part of a complete application. The requirement
Page 40 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
for a Parking Management Plan may be waived at the discretion of the DRB A Parking Management Plan shall include, but not be limited to:
a) A calculation of the parking spaces required pursuant to Table 4.1.
b) A narrative that outlines how the proposed parking management plan addresses the specific needs of the proposed development.
c) An analysis of the anticipated parking demand for the proposed development. Such an analysis shall include, but is not limited to:
1) Information specifying the proposed number of employees, customers, visitors, clients, shifts, and deliveries;
2) Anticipated parking demand by time of day and/or demand by use;
3) Anticipated parking utilizing shared spaces or dual use based on a shared parking analysis utilizing current industry publications;
4) Availability and frequency of public transit service.
5) A reduction in vehicle ownership in connection with housing occupancy, ownership, or type; and,
6) Any other information established by the administrative officer as may be necessary to understand the current and project parking demand.
d) Such a plan shall identify strategies that the applicant will use to reduce or manage the demand for parking into the future which may include but are not limited to:

2) Implementation of a car-share program;
3) Implementation of public transit subscriptions for employees.
4) A telecommuting program;
5) Participation in a Transportation Management Association including methods to increase the use of mass transit, car pool, van pool, or non-auto modes of travel;

(6) Loading and Service Areas. Every structure constructed after the effective date of this ordinance and used for non-residential use shall provide sufficient space for the unloading and loading of vehicles. The adequacy of any proposed loading areas shall be considered as part of the site plan and traffic circulation review. Such loading areas shall have access to a public alley or a public street in such a way to minimize conflicts with the circulation of other vehicles and pedestrians, be screened from public view, and provide safe and effective access to the town’s street network.
(C) On-site parking, loading, and/or service area requirements may be reduced or waived by the Development Review Board under site plan or conditional use review, based on a determination under one or more of the following provisions that, due to circumstances unique to the development, the strict application of these standards is unnecessary:
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 41
(1) green areas are to be set aside and maintained as open space for future conversion to parking, loading or services area in the event that the amount of space initially permitted is deemed inadequate to meet demonstrated need; or
(2) shared use of parking, loading and/or service areas on the same or contiguous lots by two or more establishments is proposed; or
(3) sufficient off-site parking has been procured (e.g., through lease agreements) in a private or municipal parking lot; or

Section 5.2 Site Plan Review Standards and Procedures
(A) Application. An application for site plan review, including a site development plan prepared in accordance with Section 5.1 above, and associated fee, shall be submitted to the Administrative Officer for consideration at the next available regularly scheduled meeting of the Development Review Board.
(B) Review Procedure. The Administrative Officer shall refer a complete application for site plan review to the Development Review Board and schedule a public hearing of the Development Review Board, to be warned and held in accordance with Sections 6.4(C)(2) and (D), to review the application and to determine whether the proposed use or structure conforms to the site plan review standards set forth below. The Development Review Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove any application within 45 days of the date of final hearing adjournment, and shall issue a written decision, to include findings, any conditions, and provisions for appeal in accordance with Section 6.4(E). Failure to act within the 45 day period shall be deemed approval on the 46th day. In approving a project with conditions, the Development Review Board may require specific modifications to the design, layout, scale and/or configuration of the project.
(C) General Standards. The Development Review Board may consider and impose appropriate safeguards, modifications and conditions relative to the following standards:
(1) Safety and efficiency of traffic access. Vehicular access and intersections with roads shall meet all applicable Town and State design standards, including those set forth in Section 4.1. The Board may limit the number and size of curb cuts to a single access. In instances involving pre-existing curb cuts not in compliance with these standards, the Board may require the reduction, consolidation or elimination of non-complying curb cuts. In appropriate instances, including the presence of compatible adjacent uses, areas characterized by congestion and frequent and/or unsafe turning movements, or parcels having direct access to more than one road, the Board may require shared access between adjoining properties or may limit access to a side street or secondary road. Requirements for shared access shall be made either at the time of site plan approval if similar provision has been made on contiguous parcels, or contingent upon future development of neighboring properties. Shared access shall not be required in instances in which it is not practical due to site conditions and/or incompatible adjacent uses.
(2) Adequacy of circulation, parking and loading facilities. Parking and loading facilities shall be provided per the requirements of Section 4.9 of these regulations, and in accordance with the following:
(a) Parking shall be designed to minimize the visibility of parking areas from off-site through the location, landscaping and screening of such areas. Parking shall be located to the rear or interior side (side not fronting on a public road) of buildings, unless otherwise permitted by the Board due to site conditions which would prevent the reasonable use of the property if this standard were strictly enforced. Large, uninterrupted expanses of parking shall be avoided.
(b) Driveway connections to parking areas on adjacent properties, or provision for future connection, shall be required where feasible. In the event that such connections allow for shared parking between properties, the overall parking requirements may be reduced pursuant to Section 4.9 (C).
(c) Adequate parking facilities for people with disabilities shall be required.
Page 52 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
(d) Loading and delivery areas within the site shall be adequate to meet the anticipated needs of the use in a manner that does not interfere with parking, internal circulation and landscaping.
(3) Bicycle & Pedestrian Access. Pedestrian circulation within the site, and access through the site to adjacent properties and along public roads, shall be provided. Such access may take the form of sidewalks, walking and/or bicycle paths, or other facilities depending upon the property’s location, site conditions and proximity to other facilities. Bicycle racks may be required for commercial and public uses intended for general public access. In addition, adequate access from the parking area and sidewalks to the building(s) that are open to the general public shall be provided for people with disabilities.
(4) Landscaping and Screening. Landscaping shall enhance the features and conditions unique to each site, and should include a combination of shade and street trees, shrubs, planting beds, well-kept grasses and ground covers. Landscaping is required in front and side yards, adjacent to parking areas, where rear yards abut residential properties or public roads, and as otherwise necessary to provide adequate screening. Landscaping plans shall emphasize the following:
(a) The preservation of existing ground cover and trees, especially those that are mature or determined to be of special horticultural or landscape value.
(b) The use of both deciduous and coniferous shade trees in available yard area, especially front and side yards and parking areas. Shade trees shall be placed to interrupt the facades of buildings, break-up expanses of parking, visually reduce the scale and bulk of large buildings, integrate the site with the surrounding landscape and to enhance environmental quality (e.g., wildlife habitat, soil stabilization, storm water retention, air quality, energy conservation). Shade trees are especially important in instances where street trees are not practical because of site constraints.
(c) The use of street trees along well-traveled roads. Street trees should be planted where site conditions make such plantings practical, and are required for properties outside of the Central Business District (CBD) that front upon Route 5 or Route 44. Such trees shall be planted along the edge of the road right-of-way to create a canopy effect and shall be an indigenous, deciduous species tolerant of road-salt, soil compaction and drought.
A three-year plan for all proposed landscaping shall be prepared and bonding or other surety may be required to ensure installation and maintenance in accordance with Section 6.4(E).
(5) Storm Water and Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made for the management of erosion, sedimentation and storm water runoff. Surface water runoff shall be minimized and if possible, detained on site. The Development Review Board may require a storm water management and erosion control plan prepared by a professional engineer licensed by the State of Vermont. The plan shall provide detailed information regarding proposed erosion and sedimentation control measures to be employed during all stages of the development (including site preparation, construction and post-construction). The Board may waive compliance with this provision in situations involving minimal disturbance of the site and/or limited areas of steep slope in which the development clearly poses a negligible risk to water quality, public facilities and roads, and nearby properties.
(6) Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be kept to the minimum required for safety, security and intended use, consistent with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located. Permanent outdoor lighting fixtures shall not direct light onto adjacent properties, roads, or public waters; and shall minimize glare. Such fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures and/or low
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 53
luminance lamps (e.g., maximum of 150 watts or 2,000 lumens). The Board may restrict the
height and/or location of fixtures and the maximum level of illumination on all or a portion of the property.
(7) Outdoor Storage and Display. The storage or display of outside materials, goods, supplies, vehicles, machinery or other materials shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the Board. Secured, covered areas shall be provided for the collection and on-site storage of trash and recyclables generated by the proposed development. In approving such outdoor display or storage, the Board may place conditions on the area and location of such storage or display, and may require appropriate screening.
(D) District Standards. In addition to the General Standards set forth in Subsection (C), proposed development subject to site plan review located in the following designated districts shall meet the following standards:
(1) Roadside Business and Industrial Districts. Within the Roadside Business District and Industrial District, development with frontage on Route 5 shall be designed in a manner that meets the following standards:
(a) Building facades shall be designed with appropriate window and door treatment to visually relate to Route 5. The Board may impose a maximum setback to achieve a consistent streetscape; drive-through lanes and drive-up windows are prohibited.
(b) A landscaped strip of at least twenty (20) feet shall be provided parallel to the road. Driveways and sidewalks are exempt. Form, location, and composition of the landscaped strip shall be shown on the site plan and approved by the Development Review Board.
(2) Rural District Standards. Within the Resource District and Rural District, development shall be designed in a manner that meets the following standards:
(a) Development shall be designed to minimize loss of agricultural land and natural habitat, impact on water quality, and diminishment of the scenic and rural qualities of the site as experienced both on-site and from other vantage points in the Town.
(b) Access roads, driveways and utility corridors shall be shared to the extent feasible; and, where sites include linear features such as existing roads, tree lines, stone walls, and/or fence lines, shall follow these features to the extent feasible in order to minimize the loss of productive agricultural and forest land, and to avoid physical and visual impacts.
Section 5.3 Conditional Use Review Standards and Procedures
(A) Application. An application for conditional use review, including a development plan prepared in accordance with Section 5.1 above, and associated fee, shall be submitted to the Administrative Officer for consideration at the next available regularly scheduled meeting of the Development Review Board.
(B) Review Procedure. The Administrative Officer shall refer a complete application to the Development Review Board and schedule a public hearing of the Board, to be warned and held in accordance with Sections 6.4(C)(1) and (D), for the Board’s the next available meeting date. The Board will consider whether the proposed use or structure conforms to the conditional use standards set forth below. The Board shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove any application for conditional use review within 45 days after the date of the final adjournment of the public hearing held under this section, and shall issue a written decision, in accordance with Section 6.4(E), to include findings, any conditions, and provisions for appeal. Failure to act within 45 days
Page 54 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
shall be deemed approval, effective the 46th day. In approving a project with conditions, the Board may require specific modifications to the scale, layout and/or design of the project, or place restrictions on its operation and/or intensity to ensure compliance with this section.
(C) General Standards. Conditional use approval shall be granted by the Board upon their determination that the proposed use or structure shall not have an undue adverse affect on any of the following:
(1) The capacity of existing or planned community facilities or services. The Board shall consider the demand for community services and facilities which will result from the proposed development, and determine whether that demand will exceed the capacity of existing facilities or services. In making such a determination, the Board will consider any capital program or budget in effect at the time of application. Conditions may be imposed regarding the timing and phasing of development to minimize the impact on schools and other community facilities and services.
(2) The character of the area affected, as defined by the purpose(s) of the zoning district within which the project is located, and specifically stated policies and standards of the Windsor Town Plan. The Board shall consider the location, scale and intensity of the proposed development relative to the use and character of adjoining properties and other properties likely to be affected by the proposed use. The Board also shall consider the proposed development’s compatibility with the purpose and character of the affected district as defined by these regulations, the Town Plan, and the testimony of affected property owners and other interested persons. Proposed activities that would adversely affect the character of the neighborhood, area or district shall not be approved unless the adverse impacts can be avoided or mitigated through changes to the location, design, scale, operation, composition and/or intensity of the proposed development or use.
(3) Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity. The Board shall consider the projected impact of traffic resulting from the proposed development on the capacity, safety, efficiency and use of affected public roads, bridges, and intersections. The Board will rely on accepted transportation standards in evaluating traffic impacts, and shall not approve a project that would result in the creation of unsafe conditions for pedestrians or motorists or unacceptable levels of service for local roads, highways and intersections, unless such conditions or levels of service can be mitigated by the applicant through physical improvements to the road network and/or traffic management strategies.
(4) Bylaws and ordinances then in effect. A conditional use must comply with all municipal bylaws and regulations in effect at the time of submission of the application, including conformance with the policies of the Windsor Town Plan and compliance with conditions of prior permits or approvals, including subdivision approval.
(5) The utilization of renewable energy resources. The Development Review Board will consider whether the proposed development will interfere with the sustainable use of renewable energy resources either through use of those resources or on the proposed project’s impact on the future availability of such resources.
(D) Specific Standards. In addition to the General Standards set forth in Subsection (C) above, the following shall apply to all conditional uses:
(1) Site Plan Review General Standards set forth in subsection 5.2 (C) shall apply to all conditional uses reviewed under this Section.
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 55
(2) Site Plan Review District Standards set forth in subsection 5.2 (D) shall apply to all conditional uses located within the designated district and reviewed under this section.
(3) Building Design. The design and location of structures will be compatible with their proposed setting and context, as determined in relation to zoning district objectives and requirements, existing site conditions and features, and adjoining structures and uses. Conditions may be imposed with regard to siting, density, setbacks, height, type and pitch of roofs, massing and/or orientation, to ensure compatibility.
(4) Protection of Natural Resources. Proposed development shall not have an adverse impact on important natural resources or fragile features located on the parcel, including wetlands, steep slopes, rivers and streams, critical wildlife habitat and habitat diversity, groundwater source protection areas, and/or floodplains identified in the town plan or through field investigation. The Board may require the following protection measures to ensure the protection of natural resources and fragile features:
(a) The establishment of buffer areas;
(b) Permanent protection through conservation easements or other deed restrictions in accordance with Subsection 5.5(D)(5);
(c) The designation of established building locations and/or building envelopes to ensure that activities incidental to the operation of the conditional use, including clearing and yard area, do not adversely impact identified resources; and/or
(d) The preparation and implementation of management plans for protected resources and associated buffers.
(5) Performance Standards. All conditional uses shall meet the standards set forth in Section 4.10.
(6) Protection of Water Quality. The proposed development shall not result in any direct or indirect discharge of waste, contaminants or storm water, or any in-ground disposal of wastewater, in a manner that would adversely impact existing or planned, public or private, water supplies (including both ground and surface waters). See Section 4.11.
(E) Waivers for Minor Projects. The Development Review Board may waive one or more of the standards set forth in Subsections (C) or (D), above, should the Board determine that the proposed use:
(1) Will not result in an exterior change to an existing building; and
(2) Will not require alterations to an existing site (e.g., will not result in additional parking requirements, existing landscaping is adequate, etc.).
Section 5.4 Downtown Design Review Standards and Procedures
(A) Application. An application for downtown design review, including a development plan prepared in accordance with Section 5.1 above, and associated fee, shall be submitted to the Administrative Officer for consideration at the next available regularly scheduled meeting of the Design Review Commission.
(B) Review by the Design Review Commission. The Design Review Commission shall meet within twenty-one (21) days after a completed application is filed. The applicant shall meet with the Design Review Commission to present and review a design that meets the Standards in Subsection (F). Said
Page 56 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
meeting may be continued upon mutual consent by the Design Review Commission and applicant. The Design Review Commission shall mail to the applicant, a copy of the board’s recommendation within 15 days of the last meeting and transmit a copy to the Development Review Board. The Administrative Officer shall notify the applicant by first class mail at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the Development Review Board’s review of the proposal.
(C) Review by the Administrative Officer. Applications for signs, fences and changes to the exterior that do not alter the building footprint or roof planes in the underlying zoning district may be issued by the Administrative Officer if they are in conformance with the recommendations of the Design Review Commission and compliance with Article 4. All other applications must be approved by the Development Review Board in accordance with Section 5.4.
(D) Review by the Development Review Board. The Development Review Board shall review complete applications concurrently with site plan or conditional use review, whichever is applicable. In the event the proposed development does not require site plan review or conditional use review, the proposal shall be scheduled in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.2 (B), although application materials shall be limited to those described in 5.1. In reviewing applications, the Development Review Board shall consider the recommendations of the Design Review Commission to determine whether the proposed development conforms to the Standards set forth below (Subsection E). A decision on the application shall be made by the Development Review Board no more than 45 days after the adjournment of the public hearing on the project.
(E) Review Limitations. In administering these provisions, the Development Review Board shall focus their review upon the compatibility of a proposed change, the location, anticipated use of the structure and other relevant standards as set forth below. The Development Review Board shall not:
(1) Require that new construction or alterations copy existing architectural styles or existing decorative details; or
(2) Adopt or impose any specific architectural style in the administration of this regulation.
(F) Design Review Subdistricts. Within the Design Review District, there are two subdistricts: 1) the Main Street district includes all of the parcels that border Main Street and those directly to the west within the area of the Designated Downtown, as well as properties on Depot Street, River Street, and Railroad Avenue. The Rails to Riverfront district includes all of the properties on Central Street and Bridge Street, and properties east of the railroad tracks. The design elements for review will differ slightly in these two districts. Although property owners are encouraged to comply with all of the standards outlined in this section of the Zoning Bylaws, Table 5.2 shows the design standards and elements that are required for the different districts. Within these districts, different standards will be reviewed for commercial, industrial, and residential development. For examples of the standards listed below, see the Windsor Design Guidelines (2005).
(G) Standards. Downtown design review approval shall be granted by the Board upon their determination that the proposed development conforms substantially to the following design standards.
(1) Height. The height of a building or alterations shall be considered in relation to the varied heights of existing adjacent buildings. New construction shall not exceed 40 feet in the Rails to River Industrial Subdistrict.
(2) Proportion. The relationship between the width and height of the facades of buildings shall be considered in the construction or alterations of a building. The relationship of width to height of windows and doors of adjacent buildings shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building.
(3) Rhythm. The visual patterns established by the alternation of solids (walls) and openings (windows and doors) in the facade of buildings create a rhythm. These patterns of solids and
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 57
openings shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building. Variation of spacing
between the buildings in the immediate area shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building. Particularly on large industrial or manufacturing buildings, proportional architectural details, a sense of rhythm, and scale and massing shall present a variety in their composition. Continuous unbroken masses of more than 25 feet are unacceptable.

(4) Building façade. Structural shape, placement of openings and architectural features gives a predominantly vertical, horizontal or angular character to the building's front facade and shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building.
(5) Scale and Massing. The scale and massing of new buildings shall be compatible and harmonious with surrounding historic structures.
(6) Orientation. New buildings should be oriented toward, and relate both functionally and visually to, public streets and/or common greens, parks or plazas. Consideration shall be given to buildings serving special civic, social or cultural functions, including places of worship, that may be designed to serve as prominent focal points within the district.
Page 58 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
(7) Continuity. Physical elements such as yards, fences, evergreen masses, or building facades may combine to form lines of continuity along a street. These elements shall be considered in the construction or alteration of a building.
(a) Fences. Not withstanding Section 4.5, fences in the downtown design district shall be a maximum height of four (4) feet, except when required for vehicular screening, then a maximum height shall be five (5) feet and shall be compatible with the architectural style/period of building. The structural supports of the fence shall face the interior of the lot and no chain link fences shall be allowed, unless other state guidelines supercede.
(b) Setback. The front, side and rear setbacks shall be considered in relation to the prevailing setback existing in the immediate area.
(8) Demolition. To prevent the destruction of significant historic properties, as defined by the Town Architectural surveys, the following standards apply:
(a) Any demolition or removal of a building or structure shall require approval from the Development Review Board.
(b) Before a building or other structure is demolished or moved, the applicant shall in good faith, prepare a detailed plan for the re-use and/or restoration of the vacated site, which the Development Review Board determines will meet the criteria established.
(c)`The demolition and site restoration plan shall, at minimum, describe the intended use of the site; and the manner in which the site is to be restored to grade, surfaced, landscaped and/or screened to minimize adverse visual impacts, and secured to prevent hazards to public safety and adjoining properties. This plan shall be executed not later than six (6) months after a permanent or temporary building or structure has been damaged, destroyed, demolished or abandoned. All scrap, damaged or unsafe materials shall be removed from the site. Any excavation thus remaining shall be covered over or filled to the normal grade by the owner until such time that the final landscaping or surfacing action can be completed per the site restoration plan.
(d) If a structure for which demolition has been proposed has been damaged in excess of seventy (70) percent of its assessed value due to flood, fire, wind, or other act of nature, permission for the demolition may be granted by the Administrative Officer without prior review by the Development Review Board.
(9) Signage. In addition to conforming to the Sign Standards in Section 4.12, the size location, design, color, texture, lighting, and material of all exterior signs shall be complimentary to buildings and structures on the site and surrounding properties.
(10) Lighting. In addition to conforming to the Performance Standards in Section 4.10, the following standards apply:
(a) Residential Lighting. Lighting fixture design, when possible, shall be compatible with and sensitive to the architectural style and period of the related building. Rather than mounting floodlights on a house or building, it is recommended they be mounted away from the building with the light directed toward the building/house. Floodlights shall not be aimed at the street.
(b) Commercial/Public Building Lighting. Excessively bright lighting within a building or excessive lighting of signs, buildings, structures, parking areas, or other features shall be prohibited.

(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(l) Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of these regulations, the DRB may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
(2) Procedures for Variance Hearings. In addition to the requirements of 24 VSA § 4469, in considering variances to these flood hazard area regulations, the DRB shall follow the following procedures, which include the procedures for the granting of variances found in 44 CFR, Section 60.6, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations:
(a) No-Impact Certification within the Floodway. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any impact in flood conditions or increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. A No-Impact Certification within the Floodway from a Vermont licensed registered professional engineer is required to satisfy this prohibition set forth in 44 CFR, Section 60.6(a)(1).
(b) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures set forth in this I(2)(c) - (f) herein.
(c) Variances shall only be issued when there is:
(i) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
Page 72 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
(i) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and,
(iii) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Administrative Officer in the Office of the Town Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(f) The Administrative Officer will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community’s annual or biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or State NFIP Coordinator upon request.
(g) Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure” and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(h) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(i) The criteria of paragraphs I(2) (a) – (d) of this section, above, are met, and
(ii) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(J) Warning of Disclaimer of Liability
This ordinance does not imply that land outside of the areas of special flood hazard or land use permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Windsor or any town official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(K) Enforcement and Penalties
It shall be the duty of the Administrative Officer to enforce the provisions of this ordinance. Whenever any development occurs contrary to these flood hazard area regulations, the Administrative Officer, in his/her discretion, shall institute appropriate action in accordance with the
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 73
provisions of 24 V.S.A. §1974a or pursuant to 24 V.S.A. § 4451 or 24 V.S.A. § 4452 to correct the violation. No action may be brought unless the alleged offender has had at least a seven-day warning notice by certified mail. An action may be brought without the seven-day notice and opportunity to cure if the alleged offender repeats the violation after the seven-day notice period and within the next succeeding twelve months. The seven-day warning notice shall state that a violation exists, that the alleged offender has an opportunity to cure the violation within the seven days, and that the alleged offender will not be entitled to an additional warning notice for a violation occurring after the seven days.
If the structure is still noncompliant after the opportunity to cure has passed, the Administrator Officer shall submit a declaration to the Administrator of the NFIP requesting a denial of flood insurance. Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, authorizes FEMA to deny flood insurance to a property declared by a community to be in violation of their flood hazard area regulations. The declaration shall consist of: (a) the name of the property owner and address or legal description of the property sufficient to confirm its identity or location, (b) a clear and unequivocal declaration that the property is in violation of a cited State or local law, regulation, or ordinance, (c) a clear statement that the public body making the declaration has authority to do so and a citation to that authority, (d) evidence that the property owner has been provided notice of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance, and (e) a clear statement that the declaration is being submitted pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.
(L) Precedence of Flood Regulations
The provisions of these regulations in Section 5.6 shall not in any way impair or remove the necessity of compliance with any other applicable ordinances. Where these regulations in Section 5.6 impose a greater restriction, the provisions of these regulations shall take precedence.

Section 6.2 Variances
(A) The Development Review Board is empowered to authorize a variance from the provisions of these regulations on appeal under Section 6.1, for specific cases where, owing to special conditions of a property, literal enforcement of these regulations will result in an unnecessary hardship. In accordance with the Act [§4469], however, the Board may approve a variance only if all of the following facts are found, and the findings are specified in its written decision:
(1) that there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning regulations in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(2) that because of such physical circumstances and conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) that the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
(4) that the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
(5) that the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the zoning regulations and from the plan.
(B) On an appeal for a variance from the provisions of these regulations that is requested for a structure that is primarily a renewable energy resource structure, the Board may grant such variance only if it finds that all of the facts listed in the Act [§4469(b)] are found in the affirmative and specified in its decision.
(C) Variances within the Flood Hazard Area Overlay District shall be granted by the Development Review Board only in accordance with the Act [§4424(E)] and the criteria for granting variances found in 44 CFR, Section 60.6, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, and upon finding that:
Windsor Zoning Regulations Amended March 24, 2015 Page 79
(1) The repair, location or enlargement of the nonconforming structure is required for the continued economically feasible operation of a nonresidential enterprise.
(2) The repair, relocation, or enlargement of the nonconforming structure will not increase flood levels in the regulatory floodway, increase the risk of other hazard in the area, or threaten the health, safety and welfare of the public or other property owners.
(3) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(4) The permit granted states that the repaired, relocated, or enlarged nonconforming structure is located in a regulated flood hazard area, does not conform to the bylaws pertaining to that area, and will be maintained at the risk of the owner.
(D) In granting a variance, the Development Review Board may impose conditions it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purposes of this bylaw and the municipal plan currently in effect. In no case shall the Development Review Board grant a variance for a use which is not permitted or conditionally permitted within the zoning district, or which results in an increase in allowable density.
Section 6.3 Violations and Enforcement
(A) Violations. The commencement or continuation of any development or use that is not in conformance with the provisions of this bylaw shall constitute a violation. All violations shall be pursued in accordance with the Act [§§4451, 4452].

A. Geometries of immediate access point(s) and any other highway segments / intersections, as well as traffic control devices that might be affected.
B. Speed Limit and related information of study area.
C. Sight distances (corner and stopping at access point(s)).
D. Traffic data (traffic counts by direction of travel and vehicle class, and intersection turning movement counts)
II. Project Parameters
A. General description of the project.
B. Site Plan.
C. Data regarding land use (type and intensity).
D. Trip generation rate(s) / land use unit, distribution and related parameters.
E. Parking requirements.
F. Identification of planned phasing of project.
III. Traffic Projections
A. Construction year no-build
B. Project generated traffic
C. Construction year build (combined year of construction background plus project generated traffic).
D. Planning year no-build (generally five (5) years after the construction year).
E. Planning year build (combined planning year background plus project generated traffic).
Page 102 Amended March 24, 2015 Windsor Zoning Regulations
VI. Capacity and Warrant Analyses
A. Level of Service Analyses (construction year, planning year, and their build scenario projections for existing and proposed improvement conditions).
B. Geometric features (immediate access design, left / right turn lanes(s), exiting acceleration lane, associated signing, sight distance improvement, etc.).
C. Traffic signal warrants and demonstrated need or modification to existing system(s).
V. Summary of Findings and Recommendations for Mitigation of Impacts or Denial of Project.
A. Geometric improvements.
B. Signal installation or re-timing.
C. Access management.
D. Transportation Demand Management (vanpools, ridesharing, flextime, etc.).
E. Findings for Denial of Recommendations and Mitigation Steps.

(E) Waiver Authority. In accordance with the Act [§4418(2)], the Development Review Board may
waive or modify the following, subject to appropriate conditions, upon finding that because of the special
circumstances of a particular subdivision application, they are not requisite in the interest of public health,
safety and general welfare, or are inappropriate due to the inadequacy of connecting facilities adjacent or in
proximity to the subdivision:
• application requirements;
• preliminary plat review and associated public hearing requirements; and
• development review standards set forth in Article 3.
The request for a waiver shall be submitted in writing by the applicant with the subdivision application,
and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide sufficient information to justify the waiver and
to enable the Board to reach a decision. In granting waivers, the Board shall require such conditions as
will in its judgement secure substantially the objectives of any waived or varied provisions of these
regulations.
SECTION 2.2 SKETCH PLAN REVIEW PHASE [ALLOWED FOR ALL APPLICATIONS AT THE DISCRETION
OF THE APPLICANT]
(A) Submission of Sketch Plan. The applicant may submit to the Administrative Officer, at least 15
days prior to a regularly scheduled Development Review Board meeting, a sketch plan that includes the
information for the discussion phase specified in Table 2.2.
(B) Sketch Plan Meeting. The applicant and/or an authorized representative shall attend an initial
meeting with the Development Review Board, to be held at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, to
discuss the proposed sketch plan. The intent of this meeting is to identify the type of subdivision proposed
and information and materials to be included in the subdivision application, and to discuss its general
conformance to subdivision review standards and recommend modifications as appropriate. At this
meeting the Board may request any additional information and schedule additional meetings with the
applicant as needed.
(C) Sketch Plan Recommendations. Within 30 days of the final meeting with the applicant the
Development Review Board, based on the information provided, shall issue its recommendations in
writing, which may include:
(1) A determination of whether the subdivision is a minor subdivision that should be reviewed under
Section 2.4, or major subdivision that should be reviewed under Sections 2.3 and 2.4. In making such
a determination, the Development Review Board may find that a subdivision should be reviewed as a
major subdivision, regardless of the number of lots proposed, in the event that the proposed
subdivision poses a significant threat of an undue adverse impact to a fragile feature or scenic
resource identified in the Windsor Town Plan or through site investigation.
(2) A preliminary determination of whether or not the proposed subdivision plan generally conforms to
applicable subdivision review standards under Article 3, and with the goals, objectives and policies of
the Windsor Town Plan and other municipal regulations currently in effect.
(3) Recommendations for proposed changes in subsequent submissions, including any requests for
additional studies or supporting documentation, and an indication of those requirements that may be
waived by the Development Review Board, upon written request.
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 6 Regulations
Meeting minutes, approved by the Development Review Board and delivered to the applicant, may satisfy
the requirements for a written response under this section. Development Review Board recommendations
under sketch plan review are intended to serve as guidance to the applicant for the subsequent submission
of a subdivision application. They are not binding on the town or the applicant.
(D) Effect of Sketch Plan Recommendations. Development Review Board recommendations shall
remain in effect for six (6) months from the date of issuance, unless otherwise approved or extended in the
written determinations issued by the Development Review Board. Within six (6) months of the
determination by the Development Review Board, the applicant may apply to the Development Review
Board for preliminary plan approval under Section 2.3 for major subdivisions and final plan and plat
approval under Section 2.4 for minor subdivisions.
(E) Boundary Adjustments. Applications for boundary adjustments which are determined by the
Administrative Officer to not result in the creation of a nonconforming lot, or the significant increase of the
development density of one or more lots, are exempted from sketch plan review requirements and proceed
immediately from initial application to final plat approval.
SECTION 2.3 PRELIMINARY PLAN REVIEW [APPLYING ONLY TO MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS]
(A) Application Requirements. Within six (6) months of the date of the issuance of recommendations on
a sketch plan and determination that the subdivision is major by the Development Review Board, the
applicant shall submit an application and associated fees for preliminary plan approval to include the
information required for preliminary plan review as specified in Table 2.2, unless otherwise specified or
waived by the Board under Section 2.1(E).
(B) Waiver for Large Parcels. Subdivisions involving especially large parcels, such as the subdivision
of a single two acre lot from an existing 100 acre parcel, may, at the discretion of the Development Review
Board, be exempted from one or more application requirements for the bulk of the parcel being subdivided
(e.g., such as the requirement that the boundaries of the large parcel to be retained by the landowner be
surveyed). In granting such an exemption, the Development Review Board shall require that a portion of
the subdivision (e.g. the two acre lot in the preceding example) comply with these requirements.
(C) Public Hearing. The Administrative Officer shall schedule a public hearing of the Development
Review Board, warned in accordance with Section 4.3(A), to consider the complete preliminary plan
application. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed by the Board. Copies of complete applications
for preliminary plan approval shall be available for review by local officials (e.g., Public Works Director,
Emergency Service providers) and interested persons prior to the public hearing.
(D) Preliminary Plan Approval. Within 45 days of the date of adjournment of the public hearing, the
Development Review Board shall approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the preliminary plan
based on a determination of whether or not the preliminary plan conforms to applicable subdivision review
standards under Article 3, or would be in conflict with the town plan and other municipal regulations in
effect. The Development Review Board may also require, as a condition of approval, the submission of
proposed changes or modifications resulting from further study. Approval, conditions of approval, or
grounds for disapproval shall be set forth in a written decision, in accordance with Section 4.3(C). The
decision shall be sent, by certified mail, to the applicant within the 45-day period. Copies of the decision
shall also be mailed to every person or body appearing and having been heard at the hearing, and filed with
the Administrative Officer and Town Clerk as part of the Town’s public records.
7
The approval of a preliminary plan shall be effective for a period of six (6) months from the date of
preliminary approval, unless otherwise approved or extended by the Development Review Board in the
written decision.
(E) Phasing. At the time that the Development Review Board grants preliminary plan approval it may
require the plat to be divided into two or more phases to ensure project conformity with the town plan and
capital budget and program currently in effect. Conditions may be imposed upon the filing of application
for final plat approval for each phase as the Board deems necessary to ensure the orderly development of
the project and to avoid overburdening town facilities and services.
(F) Effect of Preliminary Plan Approval. Approval of the preliminary plan shall not constitute
approval of the final subdivision plan and plat. Subsequent to the approval of the preliminary plan, the
Development Review Board may require the submission of all applicable approvals of local agencies
having jurisdiction over the project (e.g., Selectboard, Health Officer), and such state and federal agencies
as may be required by law. Upon receipt of evidence of approval of the preliminary plan by said agencies,
if required, and the expiration of all relevant appeal periods, the applicant may apply to the Development
Review Board for final plan approval under Section 2.4.
SECTION 2.4 FINAL PLAN APPROVAL [applying to all applications for subdivision]
(A) Application Requirements. Within six (6) months of the date of the issuance of sketch plan
recommendations for minor subdivisions, or preliminary plan approval for major subdivisions, unless
otherwise waived by the Development Review Board, the subdivider shall submit an application for final
subdivision plan approval, including plat approval. If the subdivider fails to do so, s/he will be required to
resubmit for minor subdivisions a new sketch plan, or for major subdivisions a new preliminary plan, for
Board review under any new zoning and subdivision regulations. The application for final subdivision plan
and plat approval shall include associated fees and, unless otherwise specified or waived by the Board
under 2.2(C), four (4) copies of the information for final plan and plat review specified under Table 2.2.
(1) Copies of complete applications for final plan approval shall be available for review by local officials
(e.g., Public Works Director, emergency service providers) and the general public prior to the public
hearing.
(2) Copies of applications for subdivisions within the Flood Hazard Overlay District (Fld) shall be
forwarded by the Administrative Officer, within 30 days of the date of receipt, to the State National
Floodplain Insurance Program Coordinator at the Vermont Department of Environmental
Conservation, River Management Section. An approval may be issued only following receipt of
comments from the Agency or the expiration of 30 days from the date the application was mailed to
the Agency, whichever is sooner..
(B) Waiver for Large Parcels. Subdivisions involving especially large parcels, such as the subdivision
of a single two acre lot from an existing 100 acre parcel, may, at the discretion of the Development Review
Board, be exempted from one or more application requirements for the bulk of the parcel being subdivided
(e.g., such as the requirement that the boundaries of the large parcel to be retained by the landowner be
surveyed). In granting such an exemption, the Development Review Board shall require that a portion of
the subdivision (e.g. the two acre lot in the preceding example) comply with these requirements.
(C) Public Hearing. In accordance with the Act [§4463], within 30 days of the date that the
Development Review Board deems that a final plan application is complete, the Board shall hold a public
hearing on the final plan and associated plat, warned in accordance with Section 4.3(A). Final Plan
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 8 Regulations
Approval. In accordance with the Act [§4464], within 45 days of the date of final adjournment of the
public hearing, the Development Review Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the
final subdivision plan, based on a determination of whether or not the plan and associated plat conform to
subdivision review standards under Article 3, or would be in conflict with the town plan and other
municipal regulations in effect. Failure to act within this 45-day period shall be deemed approval on the
46th day, as certified by the Town Clerk. Approval, conditions of approval, or grounds for disapproval,
and provisions for appeal under Section 4.5, shall be set forth in a written decision, in accordance with
Section 4.3(C). The decision shall be sent, by certified mail, to the applicant within the 45-day period.
Copies of the decision shall also be mailed to every person or body appearing and having been heard at the
hearing, and filed with the Administrative Officer and Town Clerk as part of the Town’s public records.
(E) Effect of Final Plan Approval. Development Review Board approval of a final subdivision plan
and associated plat shall not be construed to constitute acceptance by the town of any street, easement,
utility, park, recreation area, or other open space shown on the final plat. Such acceptance may be
accomplished only by a formal resolution of the Selectboard, in accordance with state statute. Each
approval for a final plan shall contain a time limit within which all improvements shall be completed, not
to exceed three (3) years unless otherwise required or extended by the Development Review Board.
(F) Performance Bonding. In accordance with the Act [§4464(b)(4),(6)], the Development Review
Board may, as a condition of subdivision approval, require from the applicant a performance bond or
comparable security in a form approved by the Selectboard in an amount sufficient to cover the full costs
of new streets and/or other required improvements and their maintenance for a period of not greater than
three (3) years from the date of completion. With the mutual written consent of the Board and applicant,
such bond or security may be extended for an additional period not to exceed three (3) years. If any
required improvements have not been installed or maintained as provided within the term of the
performance bond or other security, such bond or other security shall be forfeited to the Town. The Town
shall, if necessary, install or maintain such improvements to the extent of the proceeds from such bond or
other security.
(G) Development Agreements. The Windsor Selectboard may enter into an agreement governing any
combination of the timing, financing, and coordination of public or private facilities and improvements in
accordance with the conditions of subdivision approval, provided that the agreement is in compliance with
all application bylaws in effect.
SECTION 2.5 PLAT RECORDING REQUIREMENTS [applying to all approved subdivisions]
(A) In accordance with the Act [§ 4463(b)], within 180 days of the date of receipt of final plan and plat
approval under Section 2.4 (E), the applicant shall file two (2) copies of the final subdivision plat, for
recording with the Town in conformance with the requirements of 27 V.S.A., Chapter 17. Approved plats
not filed and recorded within this 180 day period shall expire.
(B) Prior to plat recording, the plat must be signed by the Development Review Board Chair or Vice-
Chair. All final plats must include a notation to include the following statement:
The subdivision depicted on this plat was duly approved, as conditioned, by the Windsor
Development Review Board in accordance with the Windsor Subdivision Regulations and all other
applicable laws and regulations on the ___ day of __________________ 2___. Subdivision
Permit#___________________.
Signed: _______________________________ [Development Review Board Chair or Vice-Chair].
9
The Board may, as a condition of final plat approval, require that other notations pertaining to conditions
of subdivision approval also be included on the final plat.
(C) Every subdivision plat shall show all proposed rights-of-way and easements as required under these
regulations. Documentation and assurances shall be provided that all required improvements and
associated rights-of-way and easements and other common lands or facilities will be maintained either by
the subdivider, a homeowners' association, or through other accepted legal mechanism. Such
documentation shall be in a form approved by the Development Review Board and filed in the Windsor
Land Records.
(D) The municipality shall meet all recording requirements for final subdivision plan approval as specified
for municipal land use permits under Section 4.6.
SECTION 2.6 COORDINATION WITH ZONING PERMITS
Prior to the issuance of a zoning permit for development on any subdivided lot approved under these
regulations, the Administrative Officer will determine whether said lot and the proposed development is in
compliance with all conditions of subdivision approval. The Administrative officer shall not issue a
zoning permit for any development that is not in compliance with such approval, or for any lot that is in
violation of a condition of approval.
SECTION 2.7 REVISIONS TO AN APPROVED PLAT
No changes, modifications, or other revisions that alter the plat or conditions attached to an approved
subdivision plan shall be made unless the proposed revisions are first resubmitted to the Development
Review Board as a minor subdivision and the Board approves such revisions after public hearing. In the
event that such subdivision plan revisions are recorded without complying with this requirement, the
revisions shall be considered null and void.

ARTICLE 3. PLANNING AND DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION 3.1 GENERAL STANDARDS
(A) Character of the Land. Prior to the approval of a subdivision, the applicant shall satisfy the Board
that the land to be subdivided is of such a character that it can be used for the intended purpose and
density of use without undue adverse impact on public health and safety, the environment, neighboring
properties, or the rural character and natural beauty of the community.
(B) Conformance with the Town Plan & Other Regulations. Subdivisions shall conform to the town
plan, zoning regulations, capital budget and program, and all other bylaws, ordinances and regulations of
the Town of Windsor currently in effect.
(C) Lot Layout. The layout of lots shall conform to the town=s zoning regulations. The following
standards shall apply to all subdivisions:
(1) Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have sufficient width to permit a front yard setback on each street.
(2) Side Lots. Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to straight streets, or radial to curved street
lines.
(3) Lot Shape. Lots with irregular shapes (curves, jogs, dog-legs, etc.) should not be created unless
warranted by conditions of topography, the location of natural features or existing road conditions.
(4) Lot Size and Density. Lot sizes and densities in the zoning regulations are a minimum standard;
lower densities and/or larger lot sizes may be required by the Development Review Board based on
prevailing site conditions and the potential impact on fragile features and natural and cultural
resources. Densities may be increased by the Development Review Board only for planned residential
and planned unit developments under Section 5.5 of the Windsor Zoning Regulations.
(5) Frontage Requirements. Lots shall meet minimum lot frontage requirements for the zoning district in
which they are located, unless the lot is approved as part of a planned residential or planned unit
development under Section 5.5 of the Windsor Zoning Regulations. The Development Review Board
may, however, allow for the creation of a lot that does not meet the minimum frontage requirement in
accordance with Section 4.1 of the Windsor Zoning Regulations. Such lots may be approved if it will
result in a subdivision design which better achieves the standards set forth in this Article than would
otherwise be possible without the reduced frontage, and providing that the reduced frontage will not
result in an increase in density beyond what is otherwise allowed under the zoning regulations.
(D) Monuments & Lot Corner Markers. Permanent monuments and corner markers shall be placed
in conformance with the Rules of the Board of Land Surveyors, Part 5, Standards for the Practice of Land
Surveying. At a minimum, monuments shall be placed at four perimeter points on all subdivided parcels
and at street intersections and points of curvature. All monuments shall be installed prior to the sale of any
subdivided lot(s).
(E) Landscaping & Screening. The preservation, planting and maintenance of trees, ground cover or
other vegetation, of a size and type deemed appropriate by the Board, may be required in the following
instances:
13
(1) to provide an undisturbed vegetated buffer between developed and undeveloped portions of the site
to protect water quality and/or other natural features. At a minimum, a fifty (50) feet buffer shall be
established from the mean water level of any stream and/or the delineated boundary of an identified
wetland.
(2) to provide screening of development to increase privacy, reduce noise and glare, or to otherwise
soften and/or lessen the visual impacts of development;
(3) to establish street trees along public or private roads to establish a canopy effect and/or maintain a
pedestrian scale where the Board deems it appropriate;
(4) to preserve existing specimen trees, tree lines, wooded areas of particular natural or aesthetic value to
the site, or critical wildlife habitat; and/or
(5) to establish a barrier between incompatible land uses.
(F) Energy Conservation. To conserve energy, all subdivisions shall use the least amount of area for
road-ways and the least length of sewer, water and utility lines within environmentally and economically
sound limits. Clustered development (e.g., planned residential and planned unit development) should be
considered wherever feasible. The siting of buildings should maximize solar access where feasible, and
landscaping should be effectively used to provide wind barriers and reduce heat loss or gain.
(G) Disclosure of Subsequent Development Plans. Whenever an applicant submits a proposal for
development on a minor portion of a parcel the Board may require a general indication of the intended
uses of the remaining portion of land. Such an indication should include access, type of use, intensity of
use, and phasing.
SECTION 3.2 PROTECTION OF NATURAL & CULTURAL RESOURCES
(A) Suitability of Land for Subdivision. All land to be subdivided shall be, in the judgement of the
Development Review Board, of such a character that it can be used for intended purpose(s), as stated in
the application, without danger to public health or safety, the environment, neighboring properties, or the
character of the area or district in which it is located. To this end, the Board may require that applicants
provide a detailed site analysis identifying all fragile features and natural and cultural resources described
below, the impact of the proposed subdivision on those resources, and the protection measures proposed
to avoid or mitigate those impacts.
(B) Establishment of Development Envelopes. The Development Review Board may require the
designation of development envelopes to protect natural and cultural resources described in this Section,
and to ensure the maintenance and/or extension of district settlement patterns as described in Section 3.3.
Development envelopes, when required, shall be configured to limit the location of one or more site
improvement on the subdivided lot, including principal and accessory structures, parking areas, and
associated site development (excluding road and utility rights-of-way or easements). In the event no
development envelope is required, subsequent development on the subdivided lot shall comply with all
applicable zoning standards. The Board may require the identification of specific building footprints if, in
their judgement, such information is required to meet the standards set forth in these regulations.
(C) Protection of Wetlands, Floodplains and Surface Waters. Subdivision boundaries, lot layout and
development envelopes shall be located and configured to avoid any adverse impact to wetlands,
floodplains, streams and rivers. Methods for avoiding such impacts include but may not be limited to the
following:
(1) Within the Rural District and Resource 10 and Resource 25 Districts, lot boundaries shall be
configured to prevent the fragmentation of floodplain or wetlands unless appropriate legal
mechanisms are put in place to ensure permanent protection.
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 14 Regulations
(2) Development envelopes and the layout of roads, driveways and utilities shall be located and sized to
exclude these features, except as provided under subsection (3), below. At a minimum, development
envelopes and associated site improvements shall be setback the minimum distance required under
existing zoning regulations.
(3) Buffer areas sufficient in width to protect the identified feature(s) shall be designated; disturbance
within buffer areas shall be limited to the minimum clearing and excavation necessary to create and
maintain:
(a) road, driveway and utility crossings;
(b) streambank stabilization and restoration projects, in accordance with all applicable state and
federal regulations;
(c) bicycle and pedestrian paths and trails; and/or
(d) public recreation facilities and improved river/lake accesses (e.g., swim-holes, boat launches,
fishing accesses).
(4) Shoreline, riparian areas and wetlands, and adjacent buffer lands, should be designated as open space.
(D) Protection of Steep Slopes, Prominent Hilltops & Ridgelines. Subdivision boundaries, lot layout
and development envelopes shall be located and configured to minimize adverse impacts to slopes greater
than 15%, to avoid disturbance to slopes in excess of 25%, and to avoid the placement of structures on
prominent hilltops and ridgelines. Methods for avoiding such adverse impacts include but may not be
limited to the following:
(1) Development envelopes shall be located to exclude these features. In the event that development on
slopes greater than 15% is necessary to achieve the most desirable subdivision design for a site, the
Board shall limit clearing, excavation and/or filling on such lands to the greatest extent practical, and
may require the preparation and implementation of an erosion control plan for the property, in
accordance with Section 3.4, as a condition of approval.
(2) Excavation, filling and development on slopes in excess of 25% shall be avoided.
(3) Development envelopes shall be located and configured so that the height of any structure placed on
the site after subdivision will not visually exceed the height of the adjacent tree canopy serving as the
visual backdrop to the structure, and shall be located down-slope of ridgelines and prominent hilltops.
(4) Access roads, including the conversion of logging roads to private roads or driveways, and utility
corridors, shall use or share existing accesses and rights-of-way where feasible; follow existing
contours to achieve angled ascents, and avoid areas of steep slope.
(5) Land characterized by steep slopes, shallow soils, prominent knolls and ridgelines should be
designated as open space.
(E) Protection of Wildlife Habitat & Natural Areas. Subdivision boundaries, lot layout and
development envelopes shall be located and configured to minimize adverse impacts on critical wildlife
habitat, including travel corridors, and natural areas identified in the Windsor Town Plan, by the Vermont
Department of Fish & Wildlife, or through site investigation. Methods for avoiding such adverse impacts
include but may not be limited to the following:
15
(1) Development envelopes shall be located to exclude identified natural areas and wildlife habitat,
including deer wintering areas and other critical habitats. A buffer area of adequate size shall be
established to ensure the protection of critical habitat.
(2) To avoid the fragmentation of natural areas and wildlife habitat, including large tracts of forest land
and undeveloped corridors serving as wildlife travel corridors between larger tracts of core habitat, the
Board may require the submission of a wildlife habitat assessment, prepared by a wildlife biologist or
comparable professional, to identify the function and relative value of impacted habitat and provide
recommended management strategies to maintain or enhance the those values and function. The
Board may also consult with Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department staff prior to issuing a decision.
(3) Roads, driveways and utilities shall be designed to avoid the fragmentation of identified natural areas
and wildlife habitat.
(4) Identified natural areas and critical wildlife habitat should be designated as open space.
(F) Protection of Historic & Cultural Resources. Subdivision boundaries, lot layout and development
envelopes shall be located and configured to minimize adverse impacts to historic and archaeological sites
and resources identified in the Windsor Town Plan, by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, or
through site investigation. Methods to minimize adverse impacts include but may not be limited to the
following:
(1) Historic features, including stone wall and cellar holes, should be preserved and integrated into the
subdivision design (e.g., driveways may follow stone walls) to the extent practical.
(2) Prior to development on sites that have been identified as being archaeologically sensitive in the town
plan or through site investigation, the Development Review Board may require a site assessment to
identify the presence and relative value of archaeological resources on the site, and to document the
archaeological resource and/or recommend strategies for its protection.
(3) The subdivision of land shall be designed to maintain the historic context of the site, as defined by
historic structures located on the property and in the immediate vicinity of the site, and to minimize
the impact of new development on the historic and architectural integrity of historic resources.
(G) Protection of Farm Land. Subdivision boundaries, lot layout and development envelopes shall be
located and configured to avoid the encroachment of development onto prime and statewide agricultural
soils and other open farmland. Methods for avoiding such adverse impacts include but may not be limited
to the following:
(1) Development envelopes shall be located at field and orchard edges or, in the event that no other land
is practical for development, on the least fertile soils in order to minimize the use of productive
agricultural land, impacts on existing farm operations, and disruption to the scenic qualities of the site.
(2) Buildings and associated building lots should be clustered to avoid the fragmentation of productive
farm land. Land characterized as primary agricultural soils shall not be subdivided in a manner that
will prevent agricultural use.
(3) Vegetated buffer areas may be required to buffer agricultural operations from other uses to minimize
land use conflicts.
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 16 Regulations
(4) Access roads, driveways and utility corridors shall be shared to the extent feasible; and, where sites
include linear features such as existing roads, tree lines, stone walls, and/or fence lines, shall follow
these to minimize the fragmentation of agricultural land and visual impacts.
(5) Intact parcels of productive farmland shall be designated as open space; conservation easements,
limitations on further subdivision, or comparable site protection mechanisms may be required.
(H) Modifications for Compact Development. Notwithstanding this section, the Development Review
Board may waive or modify one or more of the above standards within the Medium Density Residential
(MDR) Districts, High Density Residential (HDR) District, Central Business (CB) District and Industrial
District, or within a planned residential or planned unit developments, in the event the Board determines
that the benefits of modification would result in a more desirable settlement pattern, and the impacts on
identified resources can be mitigated either on or off site.
SECTION 3.3 DISTRICT SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
(A) All subdivisions shall be designed and configured to reflect the desired settlement pattern for the
respective district in which the subdivision is located, as defined by the Windsor Zoning Regulations and
the Windsor Town Plan. To this end, the following standards shall apply to subdivisions within the
respective districts.
(1) Subdivision within the Medium Density Residential (MDR) Districts and High Density Residential
(HDR) District shall be designed to reflect the historic character of the surrounding area.
Subdivisions should be configured to reinforce gateways to the historic village, with development
envelopes and lots designed to maintain the contrast between compact neighborhoods and
surrounding countryside. Lot sizes should be consistent with traditional densities within the respective
districts, and development envelopes should be located to maintain a consistent building line and
streetscape along public roads. Sidewalks and other pedestrian facilities may be required in
accordance with subsection 3.6(M).
(2) Subdivisions within the Central Business (CB) District shall be designed to reflect the district’s
purpose of supporting a compact, pedestrian-scale, mixed-use urban core. Lot sizes should promote
compact development at relatively high densities, and development envelopes should be located to
maintain a consistent building line and streetscape along public roads or other organizing feature (e.g.,
village green, plaza). Sidewalks and other pedestrian facilities may be required in accordance with
subsection 3.6(M).
(3) Subdivisions within the Roadside Business (RB) District and the Industrial (I) District shall be
designed so that development envelopes ensure that anticipated development will comply with the
standards set forth in Section 5.2(D) of the Windsor Zoning Regulations regarding the location and
arrangement of buildings and landscaping relative to the street. Parcels with direct access onto Route
5 shall make provision for driveway or road access to be shared between subdivided lots.
(4) Subdivisions within the Resource-10 (RES-10) Districts, Rural (RUR) District and Low Density
Residential (LDR) District shall be designed and configured to reinforce the district=s rural character
and historic working landscape, characterized by wooded hillsides and knolls and open fields.
(5) Subdivisions within the Resource-25 (RES-25) District shall be designed and configured to preserve
existing forest resources and fragile features, and to maintain traditional land uses including wildlife
habitat, forest management, limited agriculture, watershed protection and recreation. Lots created in
the Resource District shall not result in the development of fragile features identified in the Windsor
Town Plan, or through site investigation, including critical habitat, wetlands, and steep slopes.
17
SECTION 3.4 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT & EROSION CONTROL
(A) Temporary and permanent stormwater management and erosion control measures shall be
incorporated into subdivision design and layout to control surface runoff and prevent sedimentation and
water pollution on-site and downstream from the proposed subdivision.
(B) The Development Review Board may require the preparation and implementation of stormwater
management and/or sedimentation and erosion control plans and associated analyses to ensure that site
improvements, including excavation, road and driveway construction and site clearing and grading, will
not unduly impact neighboring properties or surface waters. Such plans, if required, shall be prepared by a
licensed Vermont engineer, be based upon Best Management Practices (BMPs) for managing stormwater
and controlling erosion, as defined by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the U.S. Natural
Resource Conservation Service, and shall include provisions for the inspection and long-term maintenance
of stormwater management and erosion control facilities. In approving a stormwater management and/or
erosion control plan, the Board may consult with appropriate local and state officials (e.g., VANR, Town
Engineer).
(C) In instances in which a stormwater management plan is required, control of stormwater runoff flows
from all impervious surfaces shall be accomplished by limiting the post-development peak discharge rate
from the subdivision so that it does not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rate from the site for a
2-year, 24 hour event. Additional control of treated stormwater (e.g., for 10- or 25-year or 100-year, 24
hour storm events) may be required if site specific considerations warrant the attenuation of larger storm
events.
(D) If a subdivision will result in changes in flow type, flow channel, increased stormwater discharge or
flooding in areas not owned or controlled by the applicant, the applicant must secure appropriately sized
easements for all areas of flow or flooding on affected properties. Suitable land use restrictions will be
included in easements to prevent any activity that may affect drainage across the area.
(E) Areas exposed during construction shall be protected in accordance with standards of the Vermont
Department of Environmental Conservation, the U.S. Natural Resource Conservation Service or other
appropriate regulatory body. Permanent vegetation and erosion control measures shall be established
according to a schedule as required by the Development Review Board. The Board also may require the
phasing of construction to reduce the amount of land disturbed at any one time, and may stipulate
deadlines for the installation of temporary and permanent erosion control or stabilization measures.
SECTION 3.5 COMMUNITY SERVICES & FACILITIES
(A) Municipal Facilities & Services. The proposed subdivision shall not create an undue burden on
municipal facilities or create an unreasonable demand for public services. The Development Review
Board may require the phasing of development to coordinate the anticipated demand for municipal
facilities and services with the planned provision of those facilities and services, in accordance with a duly
adopted capital budget and program and any impact fee program in effect. In determining whether a
subdivision will place an undue burden on facilities or services, the Board may consult with the
appropriate municipal body (e.g., Town Administrator, School Board).
(B) Emergency Service Facilities. Adequate water storage or distribution facilities for fire protection
within the subdivision may be required to the satisfaction of the Development Review Board. Where
required by the Board, fire hydrants, dry hydrants, or ponds shall be installed by the subdivider. The
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 18 Regulations
Board may require documentation from the Windsor Fire Department and/or other emergency service
providers as to the adequacy of emergency access and fire protection facilities.
SECTION 3.6 ROADS, DRIVEWAYS & PEDESTRIAN ACCESS
(A) Applicability of Road Standards. These standards apply to all proposed public roads and to private
roads serving four or more lots. In addition, these standards may be applied to private roads serving three
or fewer lots when the Development Review Board determines such standards are necessary to provide
suitable access to, or to accommodate anticipated future subdivision.
(B) Acceptance of Private Roads. Acceptance of private roads by the town is subject to the approval of
the Windsor Selectboard pursuant to state law for the laying out of public rights-of-way. Construction of
roads to these standards in no way ensures such acceptance. In the event the Windsor Selectboard agrees
to accept a road associated with an approved subdivision, the terms of acceptance, including road
construction standards, inspection, and maintenance, shall be prescribed in an agreement approved by the
Selectboard. Such agreement may be included as a condition of subdivision approval, and such approval
may specify the timing of development on subdivided lots to ensure coordination with the terms of the
agreement between the Selectboard and subdivider.
(C) Road Design. All roads serving proposed subdivisions shall be designed in accordance with
applicable municipal road policies adopted and administered by the Selectboard, and shall generally
conform to the dimensional and geometric design standards for local roads and streets contained within the
Vermont State Standards for the Design of Transportation Construction, Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation on Freeways, Roads and Streets, dated October, 1997, or as most recently amended.
Minimum design standards include the following:
(1) Rights-of-way for all roads shall be a minimum of 50 feet in width.
(2) To ensure adequate safety and service, the width of travel lanes and shoulders shall be based on
average daily traffic (ADT) and design (anticipated posted) speeds. The design standards for rural
roads are included in Table 3.1. The standards set forth in Table 3.1 shall be considered the maximum
standards, although the Development Review Board may modify such standards for subdivisions to
achieve the following:
(a) to ensure pedestrian and vehicular safety;
(b) when the strict application of the standards would adversely impact the scenic character and/or
natural resources or features located on the site; and,
(c) for developments located within the within the Medium Density Residential (MDR) Districts,
High Density Residential (HDR) District, Central Business (CB) District and Industrial District,
or within a planned residential or planned unit developments, which should comply with the
state’s standards for urban and village roads.
(3) Lower design and posted speeds may be considered to avoid and/or minimize impacts to historic,
architectural, scenic, natural or other resources; to avoid excess costs of construction; or to better
comply with the town plan.
(4) Wider travel lanes and/or shoulders may be required as appropriate to road function (i.e., for on-street
parking, emergency vehicle access, snow removal, collector and arterial roads), or to safely
accommodate shared use by bicycles.
(5) Permanent dead end roads and cul-de sacs shall be discouraged unless deemed necessary by the Board
due to physical site limitations or safety considerations. No dead end road shall be permitted without
19
a suitable turn around at its terminus. "T" or “Y” configurations suitable to topography are preferred,
but a cul-de-sac with a radius of not less than 30 feet may also be considered as appropriate.

Freeways, Roads and Streets, October 1997.
(6) Roads shall logically relate to topography to minimize site disturbance, including the amount of cut
and fill required, and to produce usable lots, reasonable grades and safe intersections in relation to the
proposed use of the land to be served by such roads. Road grades should be consistent with local
terrain. Maximum road grade shall not, for any 50 feet section, exceed an average grade of 10%.
(7) Techniques for the preservation of scenic road corridors and streetscapes should be employed for the
construction and maintenance of roads within designated scenic or village areas, including but not
limited to the selection of visually compatible materials, the preservation of existing features, and the
management of vegetation within the road corridor.
(8) The placement of structures or materials within the road right-of-way, including mail boxes, signs or
landscaping, shall be subject to the standards set forth in these regulations, the Windsor Zoning
Regulations, and municipal policies and ordinances regarding road and highway maintenance. No
such structure or materials shall be placed in a manner which impairs visibility (site distance) from
any road or driveway intersection.
(D) Road Construction Standards. Road construction, including specifications relating to the crown,
grade, sub-base and surfacing, shall conform to the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s Standard A-76,
as most recently amended.
(E) Intersections. A new or relocated road, and any driveway, shall be located so that:
(1) a safe sight stopping distance is provided, as determined by probable traffic speed, terrain, alignments
and climatic extremes. Generally, sight distance should be eleven (11) times the speed limit (e.g., a
curb cut on a road with 40 mph speed limit would require a minimum sight distance of 440 feet which
provides a gap of 7.5 seconds of travel time);
(2) the intersection is directly opposite an existing road or driveway to form a four-way intersection, if
feasible – intersections creating centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 20 Regulations
not be permitted;
(3) the intersection intersects the existing road at an angle of between seventy (70) and ninety (90)
degrees;
(4) the intersection grade does not exceed plus or minus three (3) percent, and;
(5) no structure or planting is situated to impair visibility.
(F) Drainage & Stormwater. A stormwater drainage system shall be provided which is designed to
control and accommodate stormwater collected on all proposed roads and/or parking areas in accordance
with Section 3.4 of these regulations. Generally, roadbeds, shoulders, ditches and culverts shall be
designed and maintained in conformance with the Vermont Better Backroads Manual, as most recently
amended.
(G) Coordination with Adjoining Properties. The arrangement of roads in the subdivision shall provide
for the continuation of roads of adjoining subdivisions and for proper projection of roads through adjoining
properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to make possible necessary fire protection, movement of
traffic and construction or extension, presently or when later required of needed utilities and public
services. Where, in the opinion of the Development Review Board, topographic or other conditions make
such continuance undesirable or impracticable, the above conditions may be modified.
(H) Access Management. To better manage traffic flow and safety, avoid congestion and frequent
turning movements, preserve the carrying capacity of important travel corridors, and to avoid strip
development, the following access management standards shall apply to all subdivisions:
(1) All road access shall be subject to the approval of the Vermont Agency of Transportation in the case
of state highways and the Windsor Selectboard in the case of town roads. Access to all lots created by
subdivision of any such parcel and to all buildings or other land development located thereon shall be
only from such permitted access road or driveway.
(2) To promote shared driveways and/or internal development roads providing access to multiple lots,
subdivisions shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Windsor Zoning Regulations.
(3) If a subdivision has frontage on primary and secondary roads, access shall be from the secondary road
unless the Board determines that topographic or traffic safety conditions make such an access
unpractical.
(4) Where extensions of new roads could provide future access to adjoining parcels, a right-of-way shall
be provided.
(5) The creation of reserved strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed road in such a manner as
to deny access from adjacent property to such road.
(I) Traffic & Road Capacity. Traffic generated by the proposed subdivision shall not result in
unreasonable traffic congestion or exceed the capacity of roads and intersections in the vicinity of the
subdivision. The Board may request the preparation of a traffic impact study to identify impacts and
mitigation measures necessary to ensure road safety and efficiency, the cost of which is to be borne by the
applicant. The implementation of mitigation measures, including required road improvements necessitated
by the subdivision, shall be the responsibility of the applicant as follows:
(1) Where an existing access road is inadequate or unsafe, the Development Review Board may require
the subdivider to upgrade the access road to the extent necessary to serve additional traffic resulting
from the subdivision and to conform to these standards.
21
(2) In situations where a development may require the realignment, widening or an increase in the
capacity of an existing road, or where the town plan or capital program indicates that such
improvements may be required in the future, the subdivider may be required to reserve land for such
improvements.
(3) In the case of subdivisions requiring construction of new roads, any existing road that provides either
frontage to new lots or access to new roads shall meet these standards.
(4) Where a subdivision requires expenditures by the town to improve existing road(s) to conform to
these standards, the Development Review Board may disapprove such subdivision until the
Selectboard certifies that funds for the improvements have been ensured. The subdivider may be
required to contribute part or all of the expenses involved with road improvements necessitated by
the project.
(J) Road Names & Signs. Roads shall be named in accordance with Windsor road naming policies, as
approved by the Selectboard, and shall have specific historic, cultural or geographical relevance. Said
names shall be identified on signs designed and located in accordance with the town policy, and shall be
clearly depicted on the final plat. The Town, at its sole discretion, may assume responsibility for providing
and installing road name signs.
(K) Driveways. Driveways serving three or fewer lots shall meet the standards set forth in Section 4.1 of
the Windsor Zoning Regulations. In addition, driveways should be laid out to follow existing linear
features, such as utility corridors, tree lines, hedgerows and fence lines; to avoid the fragmentation of
fragile features and natural and cultural resources described in Section 3.2.
(L) Modification of Road Standards. In the case of unusual topographic conditions or other
circumstances which would make the strict adherence to these standards a substantial hardship, the Board
may modify the strict application of one or more of these standards providing the applicant can
demonstrate that the proposed road:
• is accessible by emergency response vehicles;
• does not pose any threat to the safety of motorists or pedestrians;
• will not result in unreasonable maintenance requirements for landowners; and
• is designed in a manner that is consistent with other applicable standards of these regulations.
(M) Parking & Transit Stops. For major subdivisions located on existing or proposed public transit
routes, sheltered transit stops, which may include centrally located park and ride areas and bike racks to
serve the development, will be incorporated in subdivision design. Major residential subdivisions shall
also incorporate one or more sheltered school bus stops as appropriate.
(N) Pedestrian Access. The Development Review Board may require pedestrian rights-of-way to
facilitate pedestrian circulation within the subdivision and to ensure access to adjoining properties or uses
or public facilities.
(1) The Board may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from a subdivision to schools, parks,
playgrounds, or other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
(2) Unless specifically waived by the Board, sidewalks shall be required along internal streets of all major
subdivisions located within the Medium Density Residential (MDR) Districts, High Density
Page Amended by Select Board 09/26/2006 Windsor Subdivision 22 Regulations
Residential (HDR) District, Central Business (CB) District and Industrial (I) District. Sidewalks shall
also be required to connect such major subdivisions to existing sidewalks on adjoining properties.
(O) Legal Requirements.
(1) Every subdivision plat shall show all proposed road and pedestrian rights-of-way, as required under
these regulations, regardless of whether the proposed right-of way is intended to be accepted by the
town. In the event that the right-of-way is not intended for acceptance by the town, the mechanism by
which the right-of-way is to be maintained, owned and/or conveyed shall be clearly documented.
(2) Documentation and assurance shall be provided that all proposed roads and rights-of-way will be
adequately maintained either by the subdivider, a homeowners' association or through other legal
mechanisms. Such documentation shall be in a form approved by the Board and filed in the Windsor
Land Records.
SECTION 3.8 WATER SUPPLY & WASTEWATER DISPOSAL
(A) Water Supply. Water supply systems shall be designed and built to meet all applicable state and
municipal requirements. There shall be no adverse impact on existing water supplies from the proposed
water supply for the subdivision. The Development Review Board may require evidence that adequate
water supply is available through an existing or proposed system prior to granting final approval. The
Board may require as a condition of approval, or as a condition of issuing zoning permits, that the
subdivider provide the results of water samples tested by the Vermont Health Department.
(B) Individual Systems. On-site sewage disposal systems shall be designed in accordance with the
applicable Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation regulations. Technical information,
including soils analysis and septic design, shall be prepared by a professional Vermont-licensed engineer,
or a Certified Site Technician, who shall certify that the proposed system complies with the
aforementioned rules. In the event that an off-site disposal system is proposed, such system shall be
secured through an easement or other form of legal conveyance.
(D) Connection to Existing System. Where connection to an existing water or wastewater system is
proposed, the subdivider shall provide evidence as to the adequacy of the system to meet the needs of the
proposed development. The subdivider will be required to provide such pumping and other facilities as
may be necessary to serve the proposed development. The Board also may require that the subdivider
provide, or have installed, at his expense, larger lines, pumping, storage and other facilities outside of the
subdivision, if required specifically to meet the requirements of the proposed development.
(E) Community Systems. Proposed development may be serviced by private, community water and/or
wastewater systems which shall be designed and installed in accordance with all applicable municipal and
state regulations and standards.
(F) Waivers. In the event that the subdivider is proposing the creation of a lot(s) not requiring water or
wastewater systems, the Board may waive the provisions of these regulations pertaining to water and
wastewater disposal, providing that the plat recorded with the Town Clerk clearly indicates that the
intended use of the lot(s) will not require water or wastewater disposal systems, and the subdivider submits
an affidavit to the Board stating his/her intent which will be incorporated as a condition of subdivision
approval.
SECTION 3.9 UTILITIES
(A) Location. All utilities, existing and proposed, throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the final
plat, and be located as follows:
23
(1) All utility systems, which may include but not be limited to electric, gas, telephone, fiber optics and
television cable, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision, unless deemed
unreasonable and prohibitively expensive by the Development Review Board due to site conditions.
(2) The subdivider shall coordinate subdivision design with the utility companies to ensure adequate and
suitable areas for installation, both for the proposed subdivision and anticipated development on lands
adjacent to the subdivision.
(3) Utility corridors shall be shared with other utility and/or transportation corridors, and be located to
minimize site disturbance, the fragmentation of farmland and other designated open space, and any
adverse impacts to natural, cultural or scenic resources (see Section 3.2) and public health.
(B) Easements. Utility easements of sufficient width shall be provided to serve both the proposed
subdivision and existing and anticipated development outside the subdivision. Such easements shall be
shown on the final plat.
SECTION 3.10 DEDICATION OF OPEN SPACE AND COMMON LAND
(A) Preservation of Open Space. The preservation of open space is strongly encouraged, and shall be
required for Planned Residential Developments (PRD) approved in accordance with Section 5.5 of the
Windsor Zoning Regulations. Designated open space may include the portion of a single lot outside of the
development envelope which is characterized by one or more of the features referenced in Section 3.2
and/or, where necessary, may encompass the contiguous boundaries of such features located on multiple
lots. Open space shall be designated in accordance with the aforementioned PRD standards and the legal
requirements set forth in subsection (C), below.
(B) Creation of Common Land. Land held in common for the preservation and maintenance of open
space; the maintenance and protection of shared facilities, such as community wastewater systems,
community water supplies, recreation or community facilities, or recreation, including road and trails
rights-of-way, may be held under separate ownership from contiguous parcels and shall be subject to the
legal requirements set forth below.
(C) Legal Requirements. The Development Review Board may require that protected open space be
dedicated, either in fee or through a conservation easement approved by the Board, to the Town of
Windsor, a community association comprising all of the present and future owners of lots in the
subdivision, and/or a non-profit land conservation organization. At a minimum, designated open space
shall be indicated with appropriate notation on the final plat. Land held in common shall be subject to
deed restrictions stipulating the permitted and restricted use of such lot, and establishing the person or
entity responsible for maintenance and long term stewardship. All costs associated with administering and
maintaining open space and/or common land shall be the responsibility of applicant and subsequent land
owners.
