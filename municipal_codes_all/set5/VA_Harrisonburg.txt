PREFACE 
    PRM Law Publishers, a division of Public Research and Management, Inc. of Washington and Atlanta, is pleased to publish this Code of Ordinances of the City of Harrisonburg, Virginia. This volume contains the city charter and the Code of Ordinances of the city. 
    The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted by the mayor and city council through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the city. 
    The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section listing of the articles within the chapter. 
    Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in title 1 of the Code that applies to the entire Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as state law references and cross references have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions. 
    This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of former Code sections and original ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 1, Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida, will publish supplements to keep the Code current. Supplements are printed in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be inserted in the Code on a regular basis. 
    We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the municipal officials in the preparation of this Code.

(d)  In the event that the commissioner of the revenue makes a written determination that a rental business previously certified as a short-term rental business pursuant to section 4-2-137 has failed to meet either of the tests set forth in subsection (a) during a preceding tax year, such business shall lose its certification as a short-term rental business and shall be subject to the business personal property tax with respect to all rental property for the tax year in which such certification is lost and any subsequent tax years until such time as the rental business obtains recertification pursuant to section 4-2-137. In the event that a rental business loses its certification as a short-term rental business pursuant to this subsection, such business shall not be required to refund to customers daily rental property taxes previously collected in good faith, and shall not be subject to assessment for business personal property taxes with respect to rental property for tax years preceding the year in which the certification is lost unless the commissioner makes a written determination that the business obtained its certification by knowingly making materially false statements in its application, in which case the commissioner may assess the taxpayer the amount of the difference between short-term rental property taxes remitted by such business during the period in which the taxpayer wrongfully held certification and the business property taxes that would have been due during such period but for the certification obtained by the making of the materially false statements. Any such assessment, and any determination not to certify or to decertify a rental business as a short-term rental business as defined in this subsection, may be appealed pursuant to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 58.1-3983.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, for appeals of local business taxes, which shall apply mutatis mutandis to such assessments and certification decisions.

CHAPTER 7. - MALFUNCTIONING ALARM SYSTEMS AND FALSE ALARMS 

Sec. 5-7-1. - Purpose. 
    The city council hereby finds that malfunctioning alarm systems, and the false alarms associated with them, constitute a hazard to public safety personnel and the public in general. The regulation of alarm systems and false alarms is necessary to promote the health, safety, and welfare of city citizens. False alerts of intrusions or robberies increase the city's public safety costs, divert public safety resources from other critical areas of work and burden the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Emergency Communications Center. In order to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the city's police and fire and rescue emergency services, those who utilize automatic alarm systems must be required to maintain those systems in good working order, to familiarize themselves with the proper operation of those systems, and to promptly repair any defects which may cause those systems to trigger false alarms.

    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, ground-water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any violation of this section shall be corrected within thirty (30) days of written notification from the director of public utilities and failure to correct the violation shall result in a monthly surcharge not to exceed the greater of twelve dollars ($12.00) monthly or ten (10) percent of the monthly charges. The director of public utilities is hereby authorized to grant an exception to the above prohibition where such water cannot be directly discharged into the environment due to its quality. Such exception shall be granted subject to the following conditions: (1) The quality of the water to be placed into the sanitary sewer shall meet all of the requirements of this article and other ordinances of the city; (2) the water shall be released into the sanitary sewer at a time and rate acceptable to the capacity of the receiving sanitary sewer line; and (3) the water shall be metered and the customer shall be billed both sewer and authority rates pursuant to section 7-4-2. Any such exception shall be reviewed and approved by the director of public utilities and then implemented by the customer according to its approved plan. Failure to comply with such plan shall result in revoking the granted exception. The director of public utilities may grant an additional exception for environmental projects ("green water") intended to utilize stormwater and surface water for non-potable uses such as sanitary conveyance. Under arrangements where "green water" is used in conjunction with water supplied from the city system, all conditions and charges of this section shall apply but in addition the metered non-potable "green water" shall be billed at a specific water rate that has been determined to provide the city with sufficient revenue to fund typical fixed costs, but to also provide the customer with a reduced rate.

When the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of Pollutant per unit of production, the Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of Pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users. 
In any such case the Authority, in calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the Categorical Standard by the Industrial User's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. For New Sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. 
Further in any such case the Authority, in calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived as stated immediately above by the average daily flow rate of the Industrial User's regulated process Wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year. 
3)  Equivalent Limitations to Those Expressed as Concentration. When the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of Pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the Authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Authority. The Authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all the following conditions specified below. To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User must: 
a)  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its Wastewater Discharge Permit; 
b)  Currently use control and Treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for Treatment; 
c)  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
d)  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or Pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and 
e)  Have consistently complied with all applicable Categorical Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request for equivalent mass limits. 
Further, an Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
f)  Maintain and effectively operate control and Treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
g)  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
h)  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined initially. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
i)  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
The Authority, if it establishes equivalent mass limits, will: 
j)  Calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average limits for the applicable Categorical Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
k)  Upon notification of a revised production rate, reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
l)  Retain the same equivalent mass limit in a subsequent Wastewater Discharge Permit if the Industrial User's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for Treatment. The Industrial User must also be in compliance with 40 CFR  403.17 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
m)  The Authority will not express limits in terms of mass for Pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other Pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass.

Sec. 7-3-91.1. - Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
    When the System achieves consistent removal (as defined by 40 CFR  403.7) of Pollutants limited by Categorical Standards, the Authority may in its discretion apply for modification of specific limits in the Categorical Standards. The Authority may then modify Pollutant Discharge limits in the Categorical Standards to reflect such "Removal Credits" if the requirements contained in 40 CFR  403.7 are met and prior EPA approval is obtained. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-92. - Specific pollutant limitations. 
    The City and Authority have established Local Limits in section 7-3-83 applicable to all Users. The City and Authority further reserve the right to set specific numerical limitations on the quantity of Pollutants discharged by any User to the System. Such further limitations may affect a single User, a category of Users, or all Users and will be set at such limits which will further the objectives of these Regulations. 
(Ord. of 4-23-91; Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-92.2. - Authority's Right of Revision.

(Ord. of 4-23-91; Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-94. - Dilution prohibited. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in this chapter, the federal categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state or local law or regulation. 
(Ord. of 4-23-91) 
Sec. 7-3-95. - Accidental Discharge. 
    Each User shall provide protection from accidental Discharge of prohibited Pollutants or other substances regulated by these Regulations. In case of an accidental Discharge, it is the responsibility of the User to immediately telephone and otherwise notify the City and Authority of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the Discharge, type of waste, concentration, volume, and corrective actions. 
1)  Written Notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental Discharge, the User shall submit to the Authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the Discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the System, fish kills, or any other damage to Person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed under these Regulations or other applicable law. 
2)  Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous or accidental Discharge.

Sec. 7-3-96. - Control of new or increased wastewater. 
    The City or Authority may deny or condition new or increased contributions of Pollutants, or changes in the nature of Pollutants, to the System by any User where such contributions do not meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or where such contributions would cause a risk of Pass Through or Interference to the System. All Industrial Users shall promptly notify the Authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of Pollutants in their Discharge including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification. 
(Ord. of 4-23-91; Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-97. - Notification of problem discharges. 
    All Industrial Users shall notify the City and Authority immediately of all Discharges that could cause problems to the System, including but not limited to any Slug Loadings by such Users. This notification shall be followed up within five (5) days by written notification as provided in section 7-3-95. 
(Ord. of 4-23-91; Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-98. - Notification of hazardous waste. 
    All Industrial Users shall notify the City, Authority, the EPA Region 3 Waste Management Division Director, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality Division of Land Protection and Revitalization in writing of any Discharge into the System of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 or 9 VAC 20-60. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in such regulations, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of Discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the Industrial User discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the System, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the Industrial User: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed hazardous waste discharges must be submitted to the Authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of Pollutants. 
    Industrial Users are exempt from the above requirements during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR  261.30(d) and  261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or any quantity of acute hazardous waste, requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the Industrial User discharges additional quantities of such hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
    In the case of new regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the Industrial User must notify the Authority, the EPA Region 3 Waste Management Division Director, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality Division of Land Protection and Revitalization of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
    In the case of any notification made under this section, the Industrial User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume or toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
    Industrial Users who commence discharging hazardous wastes after the effective date of these notification requirements shall provide notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the hazardous waste. 
(Ord. of 4-23-91; Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-99. - Treatment Cost Recovery Fees. 
    In accordance with the formula below, the Authority shall calculate and collect Treatment Cost Recovery Fees for any daily composite sample for BOD, TSS, TKN and Total Phosphorus concentrations in excess of the monthly average Wastewater Discharge Permit limit or monthly average concentration as provided in subsection 7-3-83(13). Such fees shall be calculated as the sum of each Treatment Cost Recovery Fee calculated during the monitoring period. Treatment Cost Recovery Fees shall be paid by Industrial Users within 45 days of the end of the monitoring period. 
Treatment Cost Recovery Fee = 8.345 * (X -Y) * ADF * Z * U 
Where: 
X is each single sample concentration when in excess of the monthly average Wastewater Discharge Permit limit (BOD=350 mg/L and TSS=350 mg/L) or monthly average concentration (TKN=70.0 mg/L and Total Phosphorus=14.0 mg/L) 
Y is the monthly average Wastewater Discharge Permit limit (BOD=350 mg/L and TSS=350 mg/L) or monthly average concentration (TKN=70.0 mg/L and Total Phosphorus=14.0 mg/L) 
ADF is the average daily Wastewater flow in million gallons recorded on the day the exceedance occurred 
Z is the Pollutant parameter Treatment Cost Recovery Multiplier below 
U is the Pollutant parameter Unit Cost for Treatment in dollars per pound

At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable Categorical Standard, shall submit to the Authority a report which contains the information listed in subparagraphs (a)-(e) below. New Sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of Pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable Pretreatment standards. New Sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subparagraphs (d) and (e) of this section: 
a)  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
b)  Permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
c)  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and SIC of the operation(s) carried out by such Industrial User. This description shall include a schematic process diagram which identifies points of Discharge to the System from the regulated processes; 
d)  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the System from each of the following: 
i.  Regulated process streams; and 
ii.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR  403.6(e). 
The Authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
e)  Measurement of Pollutants. The Categorical Standards applicable to each regulated process. In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or the Authority) of regulated Pollutants in the Discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by the Authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection. Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from Pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no Pretreatment exists. If other Wastewaters are mixed with the regulated Wastewater prior to Pretreatment, the User shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR  403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with these Regulations, this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Authority. 
The Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial Pretreatment measures. 
The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected Pollutant Discharges to the System. 
f)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an Authorized Representative of the Industrial User and certified to by a qualified professional, stating whether standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional Pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the standards; and 
g)  Compliance schedule. If additional Pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the standards; the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional Pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable standard. 
Where the Industrial User's Categorical Pretreatment Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR  403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR  403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (40 CFR  403.13) at the time the User submits the report required, the information required by subparagraphs (f) and (g) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. If the Categorical Pretreatment Standard is modified by a removal allowance, the combined wastestream formula, and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance after the User submits the report required by this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (f) and (g) shall be submitted by the User to the Authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
Compliance schedule for meeting Categorical Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by paragraph (1)(g) of this section: The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional Pretreatment required for the Industrial User to meet the applicable Categorical Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). No increment shall exceed nine (9) months. Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the Authority. 
2)  Categorical Standard Deadline Compliance. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable Categorical Standards or in the case of a New Source following commencement of the introduction of Wastewater into the System, the User shall submit to the Authority a report including the information described in subsections (1)(d)-(f) above. For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Authority, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to Categorical Standards expressed in terms of allowable Pollutant Discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
3)  Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance. After the compliance date of a Categorical Standard or, in the case of a New Source, after commencement of the Discharge into the System, any User subject to a Categorical Standard shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the Authority, a report identifying the nature and concentration of Pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of the Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or other pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation required by the Authority or the standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. 
4)  Reports and applications submitted by an Industrial User must be signed by a responsible corporate officer or a duly Authorized Representative of that individual. A responsible corporate officer is defined as the president, secretary, treasurer or vice president of the corporation in charge of the principal business function. In addition, the manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating facility(ies) of the corporation, if the facility employs more than 250 persons or has gross national sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million, may also sign the reports as long as the manager has been authorized to sign reports in accordance with proper corporate procedures. The responsible corporate officer may also authorize a representative to sign the reports provided the officer forwards a written notice to the Authority stating that the representative has been authorized to sign the reports. A duly Authorized Representative may be an individual or position responsible for the overall operations of the facility (e.g. plant manager) or an individual in charge of all environmental affairs for the facility. 
The following statement shall be used on all reports, application and notices requiring certification, and with all submissions of data; 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.

I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fines and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
5)  The Authority may impose mass limitations on Users which are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by the provisions above shall identify the mass of Pollutants regulated by the standards in the effluent of the User. 
6)  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by EPA in 40 CFR Part 136. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques designed and implemented to obtain representative samples. 
7)  Any Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such records shall include for all samples: (i) the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples; (ii) the dates analyses were performed; (iii) the individuals who performed the analyses; (iv) the analytic methods used; and (v) the result of such analyses. 
Any Industrial User subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall retain for a minimum of three (3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying on the request of the Authority. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the Industrial User or when requested by the Authority. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-99.5. - Monitoring and Pretreatment Facilities. 
1)  Monitoring Facilities. Each User required to monitor its Wastewater shall provide and operate at the User's expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the Building Sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the User's premises, but when such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the User, if approved by the Member Jurisdiction, the Authority may approve a facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the User. 
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Authority's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and shall be available for the Authority's inspection and use for sampling. 
2)  Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide necessary Pretreatment as required to comply with these Regulations and shall achieve compliance with all Pretreatment Standards and Requirements within the time limitations as specified by these Regulations, the Wastewater Discharge Permit, any Order or federal Pretreatment Standards, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat Wastewater to a level acceptable to the Authority shall be proven, operated and maintained at the User's expense. Detailed plans showing the Pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the Authority before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Authority under the provision of these Regulations. Any subsequent changes in the Pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Authority prior to the User's initiation of the changes. 
All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall be made available to officials of the EPA, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and the Authority upon request. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-99.6. - Inspection and Sampling. 
    The Authority shall (i) randomly sample and analyze the effluent from Industrial Users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by the Industrial Users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards or Requirements; (ii) inspect and sample the effluent from each Significant Industrial User at least once a year; and (iii) evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each such Significant Industrial User needs a plan to control Slug Loadings. If the Authority determines that a Slug Loading plan is needed, such plan shall contain at a minimum, the elements set forth in 40 CFR  403.8(f)(2)(v). The Authority may inspect such facilities to ensure compliance. All Users shall allow representatives of the Member Jurisdictions and the Authority access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination (including the right to copy such records) and the performance of any of their duties. The Member Jurisdiction and the Authority shall have the right to set upon the User's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a User has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Member Jurisdiction and/or the Authority will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
    In addition, all Users shall pay to the Member Jurisdiction or the Authority all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Member Jurisdiction or the Authority in connection with inspections, Wastewater monitoring, sampling and testing. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-99.7. - Confidential Information. 
    Information and data of a User obtained from reports, questionnaires, Wastewater Discharge Permit applications, Wastewater Discharge Permits, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public without restriction unless the User specifically identifies such information as being business confidential or proprietary and requests that such information remain confidential. Information and data identified and marked by the User as business confidential or proprietary will be held confidential by the Authority to the extent permissible under law. Information and data concerning effluent data cannot be claimed as confidential.

    The Authority may impose a surcharge on each Member Jurisdiction, User or Discharge which exceeds the limitations specified in subsection 7-3-83(13), sufficient to recover any costs that result either directly or indirectly from such exceedance. The assessment or payment of any such surcharge shall not constitute an acceptance of such wastes by the Authority, and shall not prevent the Authority from any other enforcement or other actions under these Regulations in response to such exceedance. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-110. - Defenses to Wastewater Discharge Permit Violations. 
1)  Upset. For the purposes of this section, Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Pretreatment Requirements because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the Industrial User. An Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed Treatment facilities, inadequate Treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards or Pretreatment Requirements if the requirements of subsection 4.9(1)(a) are met. 
a)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of Upset. An Industrial User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of Upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(i)  An Upset occurred and the Industrial User can identify the cause(s) of the Upset; 
(ii)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(iii)  The Industrial User has submitted the following information to the Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the Upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
A description of the Indirect Discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
b)  Burden of Proof. In any enforcement proceeding the Industrial User seeking to establish the occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof. 
c)  Reviewability of Authority consideration of claims of Upset. No determinations made in the course of the review shall constitute final Authority action subject to judicial review. Industrial Users will have the opportunity for a determination on any claim of Upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
d)  User responsibility in case of Upset. The Industrial User shall control production or all Discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its Pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of Treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the Pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
e)  The treatment cost recovery fees, outlined in section 2.13, still apply regardless of the cause or length of the Upset. 
2)  Bypass. Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an Industrial User's Pretreatment facility. Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the Treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a Bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
a)  Bypass not violating applicable Categorical Standards or Pretreatment Requirements. An Industrial User may allow any Bypass to occur which does not cause Categorical Standards or Pretreatment Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. 
b)  Notice. If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a Bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Authority, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the Bypass. An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated Bypass that exceeds applicable standards to the Authority within 24 hours from the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the Bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the Bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the Bypass and its cause; the duration of the Bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the Bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the Bypass. The Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
c)  Prohibition of Bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the Authority may take enforcement action against an Industrial User for a Bypass, unless; 
(i)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(ii)  There were no feasible alternatives to the Bypass, such as the use of auxiliary Treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a Bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(iii)  The Industrial User submitted notices as required under subsection 4.9(2)(b). The Authority may approve an anticipated Bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (c). 
d)  The treatment cost recovery fees, outlined in section 2.13, still apply regardless of the cause or length of the Bypass. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1)) 
Sec. 7-3-111. - Public notice of significant noncompliance. 
    At least annually the Authority shall give public notification in the largest daily newspaper published in Rockingham County (Daily News-Record), of Industrial Users which were in significant noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards or other Pretreatment Requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a User is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one of more of the following criteria: (i) chronic violations of Wastewater Discharge limits, defined as those in which sixty-six percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same Pollutant parameter; (ii) technical review criteria (TRC) violations defined as those in which thirty-three percent or more of all of the measurements for each Pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily average maximum limit or the average limit times the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other Pollutants except pH); (iii) any other violation of a Pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the Authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other Discharges, Interference or Pass Through (including endangering the health of Authority personnel or the general public); (iv) any Discharge of a Pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the Authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a Discharge; (v) failure to meet within 90 days after the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a Wastewater Discharge Permit or enforcement order, for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; (vi) failure to provide within 45 days after the due date required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; (vii) failure to accurately report noncompliance; or (viii) any other violation or group of violations which the Authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the Pretreatment program. 
Sec. 7-3-112. - Severability. 
    If any provision, paragraph, word, section or article of these Regulations is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections and chapters shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect. 
(Ord. of 6-26-18(1))

(2)  Such use is not discontinued for more than two (2) years; and, 
(3)  The buildings or structures are maintained in their then structural condition. 
(c)  The burden of establishing nonconforming status shall be that of the owner of the property.

(a)  Whenever a nonconforming use is enlarged or extended beyond the size, character, or intensity of the use as it existed at the time that it became nonconforming, the nonconforming status of such use shall terminate and become unlawful. Any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations applicable in the district in which it is located. When a use is regulated by this chapter in a quantifiable manner, including but not limited to regulations limiting the number of unrelated occupants permitted in a dwelling unit and limiting the density of dwelling units, any quantifiable increase shall constitute an enlargement or extension beyond the size, character, or intensity of the use. 
(b)  If a nonconforming use is changed to a more restricted nonconforming use for a period of more than two (2) years, the original nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned and the use shall not thereafter be changed back to the original nonconforming use. 
(c)  No building or structure associated with a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered, as provided in the Uniform Statewide Building Code unless: 
(1)  A zoning verification letter has been received documenting the existence and extent of the nonconforming use; and 
(2)  The structural alteration to the building or structure does not increase or extend the square footage dedicated to the nonconforming use. Any use of new square footage added to the building or structure must be a use otherwise permitted in the zoning district. 
(d)  If a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster or an act of God, then the building or structure may be restored and nonconforming use continued so long as the use is not discontinued for more than two (2) years.

Sec. 10-3-22. - Nonconforming structures. 
(a)  The owner of any building or structure damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster or other act of God may repair, rebuild, or replace such building or structure to eliminate or reduce the nonconforming features to the extent possible, without the need to obtain a variance. 
(1)  If such building or structure is damaged greater than fifty (50) percent of the present assessed value of the building or structure and cannot be repaired, rebuilt or replaced except to restore it to its original nonconforming condition, the owner shall have the right to do so. Any work done under this subsection to repair, rebuild or replace such building or structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code and the provisions of applicable local floodplain regulations. 
(2)  Unless such building or structure is repaired, rebuilt or replaced within two (2) years of the date of the natural disaster or other act of God, such building or structure shall only be repaired, rebuilt or replaced in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, except if such building or structure is in an area under a federal disaster declaration and the building or structure has been damaged or destroyed as a direct result of conditions that gave rise to the declaration, in which case the owner shall have an additional two (2) years to repair, rebuild or replace such building or structure. 
(b)  An existing porch or carport with a roof that is nonconforming as to height or setback regulations but devoted to a conforming use may be enclosed, provided that such addition does not compound the existing nonconformity as to setback and height regulations. In the event that enclosing of the porch or carport creates a public safety problem, such enclosure shall not be allowed.

ARTICLE L.3. - MX-U MIXED USE PLANNED COMMUNITY DISTRICT 

Sec. 10-3-58.1. - General. 
    The regulations set forth in this article or set forth elsewhere in this chapter when referred to in this article are the "MX-U" Mixed Use Planned Community District Regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-24-09(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-58.2. - Purpose of the district. 
    This district is intended to provide opportunities for the development of planned mixed use communities offering an integrated and compatible mix of residential, commercial and employment uses and open spaces, together with certain governmental, educational, religious, recreational and support uses. Innovative building types and creative subdivision design solutions are encouraged to promote neighborhood cohesiveness, walkability, connected transportation systems, community green spaces and protection of environmental resources. Communities shall be developed and redeveloped in accordance with a master development plan adopted at the time of rezoning or a subsequent approved amendment thereof. In order to carry out the intent of this article, planned communities developed under these district regulations and the approved master development plan shall achieve the following design objectives: 
(1)  A mix of uses is provided so that residents can live, work, shop, and carry out many of life's other activities within the neighborhood. 
(2)  Uses are well-integrated rather than widely separated and buffered. Compatibility between different uses is achieved through effective site planning and orientation of site and building access and entry, compatible architectural design, and landscaping and screening of parking lots, utilities, mechanical/electrical/telecommunications equipment and service/refuse functions. 
(3)  Development is clustered to preserve valuable environmental resources and provide usable recreational open space. 
(4)  The open space system is as carefully designed as the development area so as to offer usable parks, connected green spaces, and village greens and civic spaces visible from roadways and spatially defined by abutting building facades and/or landscape elements. 
(5)  Vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle transportation is facilitated through a connected system of roads, sidewalks and/or trails so as to provide many choices with regard to mode and route. The proximity and integration of uses allows residents to walk, ride a bicycle, or take transit for many trips between home, work, shopping, and school. 
(6)  The overall intensity of development is designed to be high enough to support transit service. 
(7)  Traffic calming techniques may be used to reduce vehicle speed and increase pedestrian and bicycle safety. 
(8)  Principal buildings address the street, presenting front facades on the publicly visible side of the building. 
(9)  The visual impact of vehicular off-street parking and garages on public streetscape views is minimized through innovative site planning and building design, including parking areas located to the rear of buildings, use of architectural design elements such as massing, form, materials, and fenestration to make garages visually compatible with inhabited buildings, and parking areas screened with landscape elements.

(Ord. of 4-23-96: Ord. of 5-28-02,  3; Ord. of 7-22-08(5); Ord. of 9-27-11; Ord. of 6-26-18(3)) 
Sec. 10-3-119. - Procedure. 
(a)  All proposed amendments to this chapter shall be transmitted by the city planner to the planning commission for recommendation and report prior to action thereon by the city council. Before making any recommendation on a proposed amendment, the planning commission shall give notice of a public hearing thereon, as set forth in  15.1-431 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. Unless the proposal is withdrawn by letter or other formal notice before the hearing, the hearing shall be held at the time and place announced; provided however, that if the hearing is postponed, new public notice shall be given as set forth above. If the postponement is at the request of the applicant or otherwise the fault of the applicant, then the additional public notice shall be at the applicant's expense. Following each hearing, the planning commission shall adopt its recommendation, and shall present the proposed amendment to the city council, together with its recommendations and any appropriated explanatory materials. The failure of the planning commission to report to the city council within ninety (90) days after the close of the public hearing on the proposed amendment shall be deemed approval. 
(b)  Before approving and adopting any amendment to this chapter, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing thereon, after which the city council may make appropriate changes or corrections in the proposed amendments; provided, that no additional land may be zoned to a different classification than was contained in the public notice required by this section nor shall any land be zoned to a more intensive use classification than was contained in the public notice without an additional public hearing as required by this section. The hearing shall be held at the time and place announced in the public notice. An affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of city council shall be required to amend any provision of this chapter. 
(c)  The planning commission shall not recommend, nor shall the city council adopt, any amendment to this chapter until notice of intention to do so has been published once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the city. Such notice shall specify the time, date and place of the hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views. The second notice shall be published not less than six (6) days before the hearing. 
(d)  When a proposed amendment of this chapter involves a change in the zoning classification of twenty-five (25) or less parcels of land, then, in addition to the advertising as required in the preceding paragraph, written notice shall be given at least five (5) days before the hearing to the owner or agent of each parcel involved, and to the owners of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property affected. Notice sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address of such owner, as shown on the current real estate tax assessment books, shall be deemed adequate compliance with this requirement. 
(e)  Posting of property. Notwithstanding any advertising requirements imposed by the Code of Virginia, as amended, any property proposed for review due to a change of district or any public hearing as elsewhere specified in this article shall be posted for public notice as specified below. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the planning commission's public hearing on the pending application, the city shall erect on the subject property signs indicating the change proposed and a contact phone number for persons wanting more information regarding the public hearing/meeting. Such signs may not be removed until the city council has acted upon the application, and shall be removed no later than five (5) days thereafter. The city shall determine the number of signs required, placement, and type of posting; however, there shall be at least one sign posted along each public right-of-way abutting the property. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96; Ord. of 5-28-02,  4) 
Sec. 10-3-120. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. of April 27, 2010(1), repealed  10-3-120, which pertained to plan of development and derived from Ord. of 4-23-96. 
Sec. 10-3-121. - Reconsideration of request. 
    No request for amendment to this chapter, including the zoning map, or substantially the same request shall be reconsidered within one year of the date acted upon by the city council. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96) 
Sec. 10-3-122. - Withdrawal of application. 
    Applications for a change in zoning may be withdrawn from consideration before the first notice of a public hearing thereon has been published and fees refunded if no publication cost is incurred. Application for a change in zoning which are withdrawn after the end of the public hearing shall be considered as denied for the purpose of one-year limitation or reconsideration as provided in section 10-3-121. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96; Ord. of 4-27-10(2)) 
Sec. 10-3-123. - Conditional zoning. 
(a)  Purpose. Where competing and incompatible uses conflict, traditional zoning methods and procedures are sometimes inadequate. In such cases, more flexible and adaptable zoning methods are needed to permit differing land uses and at the same time to recognize effects of change. It is the purpose of this section to provide a zoning method authorized under  15.1-491, Code of Virginia 1950, as amended, whereby a zoning reclassification may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered by the zoning applicant for the protection of the community even though said conditions may not be generally applicable to land similarly zoned. While the conditions may vary from property to property by reason of the nature of the use and different circumstances at a particular location, it is not the intention of this section to authorize conditions limited to a particular individual or group, owner or operator, and the provisions of this section shall not be used for purpose of discrimination in housing. 
(b)  Proffer in writing. As part of a petition for rezoning or amendment of the zoning district map, the owner or owners of the property involved may, prior to a public hearing before the city council, voluntarily proffer in writing such reasonable conditions, in addition to the regulations provided for the zoning district or districts as herein set forth, as he deems appropriate for the particular case; provided, that: 
(1)  The rezoning itself must give rise for the need for the conditions; 
(2)  Such conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning; 
(3)  Such conditions shall not include a cash contribution to the city; 
(4)  Such conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or personal property for open space, parks, schools, fire departments or other public facilities not otherwise provided for in the subdivision ordinance; 
(5)  No condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical development or physical operation of the property; and 
(6)  All such conditions shall be in conformity with the comprehensive plan. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, "proffered conditions" shall be interpreted to include written statements, development plans, profiles, elevation and/or other demonstrative materials. Materials of whatever nature and intended as conditions shall be annotated with the following statement signed by the owner or owners of the subject property: 
    "I (we) hereby proffer that the development of the subject property on this application shall be in strict accordance with the conditions set forth in this submission." 
    Once proffered and accepted as part of an amendment to the zoning ordinance such conditions shall continue in full force and effect until a subsequent amendment changes the zoning in the property covered by such conditions; provided, however, that such conditions shall continue if the subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or substantially revised zoning ordinance. 
(c)  Review and revision of proffered conditions. Additional conditions or modified conditions may be proffered by the applicant during or subsequent to the public hearing before the planning commission; provided, however, that after proffered conditions are signed and made available for public review and the public hearing before the city council has been advertised (whether or not jointly held with the planning commission) no change or modification to any condition shall be approved without a second advertised public hearing thereon. 
    After the city council public hearing has been advertised or commenced, should additional or modified conditions be proffered by the applicant, which conditions were discussed at the public hearing before the planning commission, then a second public hearing need be held only before the city council before the application and the modified conditions can be approved. 
    Should additional conditions be proffered by the applicant at the time of the public hearing before the city council, which conditions were not addressed at the public hearing before the planning commission, or if the proffered conditions are modified beyond the scope of any conditions considered at the public hearing before the planning commission, the application shall be the subject of a second public hearing before both the planning commission and the city council, which hearing may be either separately or jointly held. 
(d)  Annotation of zoning map. The zoning map shall show by an appropriate symbol on the map the existence of conditions attaching to the zoning on the map. The administrator shall keep in his office and make available for public inspection a conditional zoning index. The index shall provide ready access to the ordinance creating conditions in addition to the regulations provided for in a particular zoning district. Such conditions shall become a part of the zoning regulations applicable to the property in question, regardless of changes in ownership or operation, unless subsequently changed by an amendment to the zoning district map, and such conditions shall be in addition to the specific regulations set forth in this chapter for the zoning district in question. 
(d)  Enforcement of conditions. The administrator shall be vested with all necessary authority on behalf of the city council to administer and enforce conditions attached to such rezoning or amendment to the zoning map, including: 
(1)  The ordering in writing of the remedy of any noncompliance with such conditions; 
(2)  The bringing of legal action to ensure compliance with such conditions, including injunction, abatement or other appropriate action or proceeding; and 
(3)  Requiring a guarantee, satisfactory to the city council, in an amount sufficient for and conditioned upon the construction of any physical improvements required by the conditions or a contract for the construction of such improvements and the contractor's guarantee, in like amount and so conditioned, which guarantee shall be reduced or released by the city council, or agent thereto, upon the submission of satisfactory evidence that construction of such improvements has been completed in whole or in part. 
    Provided, further, that failure to meet all conditions shall constitute cause to deny the issuance of any of the required use, occupancy or building permits, as may be appropriate. 
(f)  Conformity of development plans. Upon approval, any site plan, subdivision plat or development plan thereafter submitted for the development of the property in question shall be in substantial conformity with all proffered statements, plans, profiles, elevations or other demonstrative materials, and no development shall be approved by any city official in the absence of said substantial conformity. For the purpose of this section, "substantial conformity" shall mean that conformity which leaves a reasonable margin for adjustment to final engineering data but conforms with the general nature of the plans, profiles, elevations and other demonstrative materials presented by the applicant. 
(g)  Change of approved conditions. Once conditions have been approved, and there is cause for an amendment which would be in substantial conformity with the proffered conditions, then an application shall be filed for an amendment. If the amendment concerns an approved site plan, such application shall include the submission requirements for a site plan set forth in article D. Such amendment shall be the subject of public hearings in accordance with the requirements for a new application. 
(h)  Review of the administrator's decision. Any zoning applicant or any other person who is aggrieved by the decision of the administrator pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (e) above may petition the city council for the review of the decision of the administrator. All such petitions for review shall be filed with the zoning administrator and with the clerk of the city council within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision for which review is sought, and such petitions shall specify the grounds upon which the petitioner is aggrieved.

(2)  The proposed use shall be adequately served by essential public services such as streets, drainage facilities, fire protection, and public water and sewer facilities. 
(3)  The proposed use all be designated, sited, and landscaped so that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development or use of adjacent properties and surrounding neighborhoods. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96) 
Sec. 10-3-126. - Special conditions. 
(a)  In granting any special use permit, the city council may impose such conditions as it believes necessary to accomplish the objectives of this chapter and to assure that the proposed use will conform with the requirements of this section and will continue to do so.

(1)  A preliminary site plan if any changes to the existing site are proposed. 
(2)  A description of the proposed use including, where applicable, the hours of operation and the proposed number of employee/patrons. 
(3)  When requested by the planning commission or the city council, the following information shall be provided by the applicant: 
a.  Elevations and floor plans of the proposed buildings. 
b.  A traffic impact analysis, showing the effect of traffic generated by this project on surrounding streets and neighborhoods. 
(b)  If the request for a special use permit has been denied by city council, a request in substantially the same form shall not be resubmitted with one year of the date of denial. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96; Ord. of 11-25-08(6); Ord. of 6-26-18(4)) 
Sec. 10-3-128. - Procedure. 
(a)  No special use permit shall be approved unless the proposal has been reviewed by the planning commission as provided in article U of this chapter. Following planning commission's public hearing, the planning commission shall prepare and by motion adopt its recommendations, which may include changes in the applicant's original proposal resulting from the hearing, and shall transmit such recommendations, together with any explanatory material, to the city council. Failure of the planning commission to report within ninety (90) days after the close of its public hearing shall be deemed approval, unless the proposed special use permit has been withdrawn by the applicant prior to the expiration of such time period or the time period has been extended by mutual agreement by the city and the applicant. 
(b)  Before approving a special use permit, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing as provided in article U of this chapter after which the city council may make appropriate changes to or impose appropriate conditions upon the proposed special use. Nothing herein shall preclude the city council from holding a joint public hearing with the planning commission. 
(c)  A concurring vote of a majority of the members of city council shall be required to approve a special use permit. 
(d)  Whenever a petitioner seeks both an amendment to the zoning ordinance and a special use permit for the same property, both or all related applications may be made and processed jointly. 
(e)  Posting of property. Notwithstanding any advertising requirements imposed by the Code of Virginia, as amended, any property proposed for review due to a special use permit or any public hearing as elsewhere specified in this ordinance shall be posted for public notice as specified below. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the planning commission's public hearing on the pending application, the city shall erect on the subject property signs indicating the special use permit proposed and a contact phone number for persons wanting more information regarding the public hearing/meeting. Such signs may not be removed until the city council has acted upon the application, and shall be removed no later than five (5) days thereafter. The city shall determine the number of signs required, placement, and type of posting; however, there shall be at least one sign posted along each public right-of-way abutting the property.

Sec. 10-3-129. - Expansion or enlargement of a special use. 
    A special use may not be enlarged or expanded unless approved by city council through the approval procedure outlined in this article, or unless the expansion or enlargement was specifically authorized in the original approval or as otherwise permitted. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96; Ord. of 7-28-15(30) ) 
Sec. 10-3-130. - Expiration and revocation. 
(a)  Unless a time limit is specified for a special use permit, the same shall be valid for an indefinite period of time, except that if the use or activity should cease for any reason for a continuous period of two (2) years or more, the special permit shall automatically terminate without notice and become null and void. 
(b)  The approval of a new special use permit shall be required prior to any subsequent reinstatement of the use. 
(c)  Whenever a special use permit is approved by the city council, the special use authorized shall be established, or any construction authorized shall be commenced and diligently pursued, within such time as the city council may have specified, or, if no such time has been specified, then within twelve (12) months from the approval date of such permit. 
(d)  If the special use or construction has not commenced in accordance with the above provisions, then the special use permit shall automatically expire without notice and become null and void. 
(e)  A special use permit shall be revocable upon written order of the city council at any time because of the failure of the owner or operator of the use covered by the permit to observe all requirements with respect to the maintenance and conduct of the use and all conditions in connection with the permit that were imposed in issuing the same. A revoked permit shall become null and void. 
(Ord. of 4-23-96) 
Sec. 10-3-131. - Existing special uses. 
    Any use listed as requiring approval as a special use, and which use legally exists at the effective date of the regulations of this article, shall be considered a nonconforming use unless it has been approved as a special use by the city council.

A member whose term expires shall continue to serve until their successor is appointed and qualifies. Any board member may be removed for malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance in office, or for other just cause, by the court that appointed them, after a hearing held after at least fifteen (15) days' notice. Each member shall receive such compensation as the city council may authorize for attendance at each regular or called meeting of the board. 
(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-133. - Organization. 
    The board shall elect one of its members as chairman and one of its members as vice chairman. The chairman shall preside at all meetings of the board and in the chairman's absence the vice-chairman shall preside. The city manager, or designated agent, shall appoint a recording secretary whose duty it shall be to keep the minutes and other records of the actions and deliberations of the board and perform such other ministerial duties as the board shall direct.

(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-134. - Procedure. 
    The board shall adopt such rules of procedure as it may deem necessary in order to carry into effect the provisions of this chapter, said rules to be in writing and copies available to the public at the office of the zoning administrator and the recording secretary of the board. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. Such chairman, or in the chairman's absence the vice-chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The recording secretary shall keep minutes of the board's proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of the board's examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. A quorum shall consist of three (3) board members, one which shall be either the chairman or the vice-chairman. The board shall submit a report of its activities to the city council at least once each year. 
(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-135. - Powers. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the administration or enforcement of this chapter. During such appeals: 
a.  The determination of the administrative officer shall be presumed to be correct. 
b.  At the hearing on appeal, the administrative officer shall explain the basis for their determination after which the appellant has the burden of proof to rebut such presumption of correctness by a preponderance of the evidence. 
c.  The board shall consider any applicable ordinances, laws and regulations in making its decision. The decision on such appeal shall be based on the board's judgment of whether the administrative officer was correct. 
(2)  To grant a variance from the terms of this chapter if the evidence shows that the strict application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property and as will not be contrary to the public interest. 
(3)  To hear and decide applications for interpretation of the zoning district map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary. The board shall not have the power to change substantially the locations of the district boundaries as established by ordinance. 
(4)  To determine, in cases of uncertainty, of the district classification of any use not specifically named in these regulations; provided, however, such use shall be in keeping with uses specifically permitted in the district in which such use is to be classified. 
(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-136. - Variances. 
    Subject to the provisions of this article, the board shall have the power to grant the following variances: 
(1)  A variance in the yard and lot area requirements in any district as to relieve practical difficulties or particular hardships in cases where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date of this chapter or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of this chapter would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property. 
(2)  No variance shall be granted by the board unless it finds that: 
a.  The strict application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property. 
b.  Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity. 
c.  The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. 
d.  The property for which the variance is being requested was acquired in good faith. 
e.  Any hardship was not created by the applicant for the variance. 
f.  The relief or remedy sought by the variance application is not available through any other process available in this chapter such as modifications to this chapter or through approval of a special use permit. 
(3)  No such variance shall be considered except after notice and hearing as required by  15.2-2204 of the Code of Virginia. Such notice may be given by first-class mail rather than by registered mail. 
(4)  No variance shall be granted unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring in nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this chapter. 
(5)  In granting a variance the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. 
(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-137. - Amendment of variance. 
    Amendment of a variance shall follow the same procedures and meet the same criteria as is specified for applications for variances as described in section 10-3-138. 
(Ord. of 5-10-16(5)) 
Sec. 10-3-138. - Procedure on applications and appeals. 
(a)  Application for variances. An application to the board for a variance in which the board has original jurisdiction under this chapter may be made by any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau. Such application shall be made to the recording secretary of the board on forms which shall be provided for the purpose in accordance with rules which shall be adopted by the board. All information including maps and plans required by such forms, or otherwise required by the board in order that it might be fully informed, shall be furnished by the applicant. The recording secretary of the board shall place the matter on the agenda. Every application or appeal shall be advertised for a public hearing and said notice shall appear at least once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. Such notice shall specify the time and place of hearing, not less than six (6) days nor more than twenty-one (21) days after the second advertisement and the property shall be posted in accordance with the rules of the board. 
(b)  Appeals. An appeal to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the administrator, or from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by any other administrative officer in the administration or enforcement of this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken within ten (10) days for a notice of violation involving temporary or seasonal commercial uses, maximum occupancy limitation of a residential dwelling unit, keeping of inoperable vehicles and junk, or similar short term, recurring violations, or within thirty (30) days after the entry of any other decision appealed from by filing with the administrator, and with the board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The administrator shall forthwith transmit to the recording secretary of the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in the furtherance of the action appealed from unless the administrator certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with them, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate of stay would, in their opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or a court of record, on application and on notice to the administrator and on due cause shown. 
    In any case where the administrator has certified conformity with the provisions of this chapter and a building permit has been issued and construction of the building for which such permit was issued is subsequently sought to be prevented, restrained, corrected or abated as a violation of the zoning ordinance, suit may be filed within fifteen (15) days after the start of construction by a person who had no actual notice of the issuance of such permit. The court may hear and determine issues raised in the litigation even though no appeal was taken from the decision of the administrator to the board of zoning appeals. 
(c)  Filing fees: 
(1)  All persons, firms or corporations appealing to the board of zoning appeals shall be required to pay, at the time the application is submitted, three hundred dollars ($300.00) per request for expenses relative thereto. 
(2)  All persons, firms or corporations applying for variances under the provisions of this chapter or applying for an amendment of a variance already approved shall be required to pay, at the time the application is submitted, three hundred dollars ($300.00) per request for expenses relative thereto. 
(3)  The payment of such money in advance to the office of the administrator as specified shall be deemed a condition precedent to the consideration of such appeal, variance request or requested amendment to a variance already approved. 
(d)  Hearing and decision. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an application or appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest and make its decision within ninety days of the filing of the application or appeal. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney. In exercising its powers, the board may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify, any order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative officer or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variance from this chapter. 
(e)  Posting of property. Notwithstanding any advertising requirements imposed by the Code of Virginia, as amended, any property proposed for review due to a variance or any other public hearing as elsewhere specified in this section shall be posted for public notice as specified below. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the board of zoning appeal's public hearing on the pending application, the city shall erect on the subject property signs indicating the variance proposed and a contact phone number for persons wanting more information regarding the public hearing/meeting. Such signs may not be removed until the board of zoning appeals has acted upon the application, and shall be removed no later than five (5) days thereafter. The city shall determine the number of signs required, placement, and type of posting; however, there shall be at least one sign posted along each public right-of-way abutting the property. 
(f)  Equal say. The board shall offer an equal amount of time in a hearing on the case to the applicant, appellant or other person aggrieved and the administrative officer or their staff. 
(g)  Ex parte communications. The applicant, landowner or their agent or attorney and the non-legal staff of the governing body may not discuss the facts or law relative to a particular case with a member of the board prior to the hearing. If any ex parte discussion of facts or law occurs, the party engaging in such communication shall inform the other party as soon as practicable and advise them of the substance of such communication. 
(h)  Availability of materials. Any materials relating to a particular case, including a staff recommendation or report furnished to a member of the board, shall be made available without cost to the applicant, appellant or other person aggrieved within three (3) days of being available to the board member. Any such materials furnished to a board member shall also be made available for public inspection.

Editor's note- An ordinance adopted June 24, 2014(4) amended and reenacted article Y in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article Y,  10-3-160-10-3-176, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. of 1-8-08. See also the Code Comparative Table for full derivation. 

Sec. 10-3-160. - Statutory authorization, purpose, applicability, and compliance and liability. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. This article is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Va. Code  15.2-2280. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent: the loss of life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by: 
(1)  Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies; 
(2)  Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within districts subject to flooding; 
(3)  Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage; and, 
(4)  Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
(c)  Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Harrisonburg and identified as areas of special flood hazard according to the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that is provided to the City of Harrisonburg by FEMA. 
(d)  Compliance and liability. 
(1)  No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this article. 
(2)  The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study, but does not imply total flood protection. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
(3)  This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Harrisonburg or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. 
Sec. 10-3-161. - Records and abrogation and greater restrictions. 
(a)  Records. Records of actions associated with administering this article shall be kept on file and maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(b)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any ordinance currently in effect in flood-prone districts. Any ordinance, however, shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive. 
Sec. 10-3-162. - Designation and duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
(a)  Designation. 
(1)  The zoning administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and is referred to herein as the floodplain administrator. The floodplain administrator may: 
a.  Do the work themselves. In the absence of a designated floodplain administrator, the duties are conducted by the director of planning and community development. 
b.  Delegate duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and other employees. 
c.  Enter into a written agreement or written contract with another community or private sector entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations. Administration of any part of these regulations by another entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22. 
(b)  Duties and responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Review applications for permits to determine whether proposed activities will be located in the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
(2)  Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide available base flood elevation and flood hazard information. 
(3)  Review applications to determine whether proposed activities will be reasonably safe from flooding and require new construction and substantial improvements to meet the requirements of these regulations. 
(4)  Review applications to determine whether all necessary permits have been obtained from the Federal, state or local agencies from which prior or concurrent approval is required; in particular, permits from state agencies for any construction, reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a dam, reservoir, or waterway obstruction (including bridges, culverts, structures), any alteration of a watercourse, or any change of the course, current, or cross section of a stream or body of water, including any change to the 100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing non-tidal waters of the state. 
(5)  Verify that applicants proposing an alteration of a watercourse have notified adjacent communities, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management), and other appropriate agencies (VADEQ, USACE) and have submitted copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
(6)  Approve applications and issue permits to develop in flood hazard areas if the provisions of these regulations have been met, or disapprove applications if the provisions of these regulations have not been met. 
(7)  Inspect or cause to be inspected, buildings, structures, and other development for which permits have been issued to determine compliance with these regulations or to determine if non-compliance has occurred or violations have been committed. 
(8)  Review elevation certificates and require incomplete or deficient certificates to be corrected. 
(9)  Submit to FEMA, or require applicants to submit to FEMA, data and information necessary to maintain FIRMs, including hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses prepared by or for the City of Harrisonburg, within six (6) months after such data and information becomes available if the analyses indicate changes in base flood elevations. 
(10)  Maintain and permanently keep records that are necessary for the administration of these regulations, including: 
a.  Flood insurance studies, flood insurance rate maps (including historic studies and maps and current effective studies and maps) and letters of map change; and 
b.  Documentation supporting issuance and denial of permits, elevation certificates, documentation of the elevation (in relation to the datum on the FIRM) to which structures have been floodproofed, other required design certifications, variances, and records of enforcement actions taken to correct violations of these regulations. 
(11)  Enforce the provisions of these regulations, investigate violations, issue notices of violations or stop work orders, and require permit holders to take corrective action. 
(12)  Advise the board of zoning appeals regarding the intent of these regulations and, for each application for a variance, prepare a staff report and recommendation. 
(13)  Administer the requirements related to proposed work on existing buildings: 
a.  Make determinations as to whether buildings and structures that are located in flood hazard areas and that are damaged by any cause have been substantially damaged. 
b.  Make reasonable efforts to notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a permit to repair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct, and prohibit the non-compliant repair of substantially damaged buildings except for temporary emergency protective measures necessary to secure a property or stabilize a building or structure to prevent additional damage. 
(14)  Undertake, as determined appropriate by the floodplain administrator due to the circumstances, other actions which may include but are not limited to: issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public information materials related to permit requests and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assisting property owners with documentation necessary to file claims for increased cost of compliance coverage under NFIP flood insurance policies. 
(15)  Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the corporate boundaries of the City of Harrisonburg have been modified and: 
a.  Provide a map that clearly delineates the new corporate boundaries or the new area for which the authority to regulate pursuant to these regulations has either been assumed or relinquished through annexation; and 
b.  If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
(16)  Upon the request of FEMA, complete and submit a report concerning participation in the NFIP which may request information regarding the number of buildings in the SFHA, number of permits issued for development in the SFHA, and number of variances issued for development in the SFHA. 
(17)  It is the duty of the community floodplain administrator to take into account flood, mudslide and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use throughout the entire jurisdictional area of the community, whether or not those hazards have been specifically delineated geographically (e.g. via mapping or surveying). 
Sec. 10-3-163. - Use and interpretation of firms. 
    The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(a)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that adjacent ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations; 
(2)  Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the SFHA. 
(b)  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a Federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
(c)  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower 
(d)  Base flood elevations. 
(e)  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
(f)  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
(1)  Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to section 10-3-163(B) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
(3)  Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
Sec. 10-3-164. - Jurisdictional boundary changes. 
    The City of Harrisonburg Floodplain Ordinance in effect on the date of annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements for participation in the national flood insurance program. Municipalities with existing floodplain ordinances shall pass a resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood hazards. If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
    In accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 44 Subpart (B) Section 59.22(a)(9)(v) all NFIP participating communities must notify FEMA and optionally the state coordinating office in writing whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. 
    In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately represent the community's boundaries, a copy of a map of the community suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification 
Sec. 10-3-165. - District boundary changes and interpretation of district boundaries. 
(a)  District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the City of Harrisonburg where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(b)  Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the zoning administrator. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
Sec. 10-3-166. - Submitting technical data. 
    A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
Sec. 10-3-167. - Letters of map revision. 
    When development in the floodplain will cause or causes a change in the base flood elevation, the developer, including state agencies, must notify FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision and then a letter of map revision. 
Sec. 10-3-168. - Description of special flood hazard districts. 
    The various special flood hazard districts shall include the SFHAs. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the FIS and the FIRM for the City of Harrisonburg prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 6, 2008, and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto. 
    The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this article and which shall be kept on file at the offices of the Department of Planning and Community Development. 
(a)  The Floodway District is in an AE Zone and is delineated, for purposes of this article, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one (1) percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. The areas included in this district are specifically defined in table 6 of the above referenced FIS and shown on the accompanying FIRM. 
The following provisions shall apply within the Floodway District of an AE zone. 
(1)  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies-with the City of Harrisonburg's endorsement-for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR), and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
If section 10-3-168(A)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 10-3-170 through 10-3-173. 
(2)  The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring, elevation, and encroachment standards are met. 
(b)  The AE Zones on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which one-percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated. The following provisions shall apply within an AE: 
(1)  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Harrisonburg. 
(2)  Development activities in Zones AE on the City of Harrisonburg's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one (1) foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies-with the City of Harrisonburg's endorsement-for a conditional letter of map revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Sec. 10-3-169. - Overlay concept. 
    The Floodplain Districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
    If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the Floodplain Districts and those of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain districts shall apply. 
    In the event any provision concerning a Floodplain District is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying provisions shall remain applicable. 
Sec. 10-3-170. - Permit and application requirements. 
(a)  Permit requirement. All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain district, including placement of manufactured homes, shall be undertaken only upon the issuance of a permit. Such development shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this article and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, as amended, such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VA USBC) and the City of Harrisonburg Subdivision Regulations. Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the floodplain administrator shall require all applications to include compliance with all applicable state and Federal laws and shall review all sites to assure they are reasonably safe from flooding. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, and/or development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system. 
(b)  Site plans and permit applications. All applications for development within any floodplain district and all building permits issued for the floodplain shall incorporate the following information: 
(1)  The elevation of the base flood at the site. 
(2)  The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement). 
(3)  For structures to be flood-proofed (non-residential only), the elevation to which the structure will be flood-proofed. 
(4)  Topographic information showing existing and proposed ground elevations. 
Sec. 10-3-171. - General standards. 
    The following provisions shall apply to all permits: 
(a)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be according to section 10-3-168 of this article and the VA USBC, and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(b)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(c)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(d)  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(e)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities, including duct work, shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(f)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
(g)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
(h)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(i)  Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any channels or of any watercourse, stream, etc., within this jurisdiction a permit shall be obtained from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (a joint permit application is available from any of these organizations). Furthermore, in riverine areas, notification of the proposal shall be given by the applicant to all affected adjacent jurisdictions, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management), other required agencies, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(j)  The flood carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. 
Sec. 10-3-172. - Elevation and construction standards. 
    In all identified flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) in Zone AE with detailed base flood elevations shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood level or as otherwise required by the Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC). 
(b)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood level. Buildings located in all AE zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus one (1) foot are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the zoning administrator. 
(c)  Space below the lowest floor. In zones AE, fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall: 
(1)  Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
(2)  Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation; 
(3)  Include measures to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria: 
a.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding. 
b.  The total net area of all openings must be at least one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
c.  If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each area must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
d.  The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the adjacent grade. 
e.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
f.  Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above. 
(d)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
(1)  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the elevation and anchoring requirements in section 10-3-171 and section 10-3-172. 
(2)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
b.  Meets all the requirements for manufactured homes in section 10-3-172 (D)(1). 
Sec. 10-3-173. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and 
(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or developed using detailed methodologies, hydraulic and hydrologic analysis, comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser. 
Sec. 10-3-174. - Existing structures in floodplain areas. 
    A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of these provisions, but which is not in conformity with these provisions, may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  Existing structures in the floodway area shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation. 
(b)  Any modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use located in any floodplain areas to an extent or amount of less than fifty (50) percent of its market value shall conform to the VA USBC and the appropriate provisions of this article. 
(c)  The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use, regardless of its location in a floodplain area to an extent or amount of fifty (50) percent or more of its market value shall be undertaken only in full compliance with this article and shall require the entire structure to conform to the VA USBC. 
Sec. 10-3-175. - Variances: factors to be considered. 
    Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
    While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. Variances may be issued by the board of zoning appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the provisions of this section. 
    Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
    In passing upon applications for variances, the board of zoning appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors: 
(a)  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100-year flood elevation. 
(b)  The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
(c)  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
(d)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 
(e)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(f)  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
(g)  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
(h)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
(i)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
(j)  The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
(k)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
(l)  The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(m)  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this article. 
    The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the 100-year flood elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
    A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the FEMA. 
Sec. 10-3-176. - Definitions. 
    Appurtenant or accessory structure: Accessory structures not to exceed two hundred (200) square feet. 
    Base flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. This is a regulatory standard that is also referred to as the "100-year" flood. 
    Base flood elevation: The Federal Emergency Management Agency designated one (1) percent annual chance water surface elevation and the elevation determined per section 10-3-168. The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum specified on the community's flood insurance rate map. For the purposes of this article, the base flood is 100-year flood or one (1) percent annual chance flood. 
    Basement: Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Board of zoning appeals: The board appointed to review appeals made by individuals with regard to decisions of the zoning administrator in the interpretation of this article. 
    Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building: A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers). 
    Encroachment: The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before November 3, 1989. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Flood or flooding: 
(1)  A general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or 
c.  Mudflows which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (1)(b) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
2.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph 1.a. of this definition. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM). 
    Flood insurance study (FIS): A report by FEMA that examines, evaluates and determines flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudflow and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
    Flood proofing: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. 
    Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization in the watershed. When a freeboard is included in the height of a structure, the flood insurance premiums may be less expensive. 
    Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure: Any structure that is 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or, 
(4).  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or, 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: Analyses performed by a licensed professional engineer, in accordance with standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles. 
    Letters of map change (LOMC): A letter of map change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, that amends or revises an effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study. Letters of map change include: 
(1)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA): An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes that a land as defined by meets and bounds or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F), is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
(3)  Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study. 
    Lowest adjacent grade: The lowest natural elevation of the ground surface next to the walls of a structure. 
    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of Federal Code 44CFR 60.3. 
    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, but does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    New construction: For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 3, 1989, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    Post-FIRM structures: A structure for which construction or substantial improvement occurred after November 3, 1989. 
    Pre-FIRM structures: A structure for which construction or substantial improvement occurred on or before November 3, 1989. 
    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and, 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss structure: A building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two (2) occasions in which the cost of the repair, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event; and at the time of the second incidence of flood related damage, the contract for flood insurance contains increased cost of compliance coverage. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure: A structure that: (a) Is covered under a contract for flood insurance made available under the NFIP; and (b) Has incurred flood related damage; (i) For which four (4) or more separate claims payments have been made under flood insurance coverage with the amount of each such claim exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), and with the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeding twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00); or (ii) For which at least two (2) separate claims payments have been made under such coverage, with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the market value of the insured structure. 
    Shallow flooding area: A special flood hazard area with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Special flood hazard area: The land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year as determined in section 10-3-168 of this article. 
    Start of construction: For other than new construction and substantial improvement, under the Coastal Barriers Resource Act (P.L.-97-348), means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition; placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of the construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the state historic preservation officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the community's floodplain management regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

(a)  Except as provided herein, no person may engage in any land-disturbing activity until he or she has submitted to the department of community development for the city an erosion and sediment control plan for the land-disturbing activity and such plan has been approved by the plan-approving authority. Where land-disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction of more than one (1) local control program, an erosion and sediment control plan, at the option of the applicant, may be submitted to the board for review and approval rather than to each jurisdiction concerned. Where the land-disturbing activity results from the construction of a single-family residence, an "agreement in lieu of a plan" may be substituted for an erosion and sediment control plan if executed by the plan-approving authority. 
(b)  The standards contained within the "Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations", the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook and the city's Design and Construction Standards Manual are to be used by the applicant when making a submitted under the provisions of this ordinance and in the preparation of an erosion and sediment control plan. The plan-approving authority, in considering the adequacy of a submitted plan, shall be guided by the same standards, regulations and guidelines. When the standards vary between the publications, the state regulations shall take precedence. 
(c)  The plan-approving authority shall review conservation plans submitted to it and grant written approval within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of the plan if it determines that the plan meets the requirements of the board's regulations and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that he will properly perform the conservation measures included in the plan and will conform to the provisions of this article. In addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land-disturbing activities shown on the approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, to the program authority, as provided by section 10.1-561, of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law, who will be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land-disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence prior to engaging in land-disturbing activities may result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties provided in this ordinance. However, the plan-approving authority may waive the certificate of competence requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single-family residence. If a violation occurs during the land-disturbing activity, then the person responsible for carrying out the agreement in lieu of a plan shall correct the violation and provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, as provided by section 10.1-561 of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence shall be a violation of this ordinance. 
(d)  The plan shall be acted upon within forty-five (45) days from receipt thereof by either approving said plan in writing or by disapproving said plan in writing and giving specific reasons for its disapproval. When the plan is determined to be inadequate, the plan-approving authority shall specify such modifications, terms and conditions that will permit approval of the plan. If no action is taken within forty-five (45) days, the plan shall be deemed approved and the person authorized to proceed with the proposed activity. 
(e)  An approved plan may be changed by the plan-approving authority when: 
(1)  The inspection reveals that the plan is inadequate to satisfy applicable regulations; or 
(2)  The person responsible for carrying out the plan finds that because of changed circumstances or for other reasons the approved plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed amendments to the plan, consistent with the requirements of this chapter, are agreed to by the plan-approving authority and the person responsible for carrying out the plans. 
(f)  Variances: The plan-approving authority may waive or modify any of the standards that are deemed to be too restrictive for site conditions by granting a variance. A variance may be granted under these conditions: 
(1)  At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for requesting variances in writing. Specific variances which are allowed by the plan-approving authority shall be documented in the plan. 
(2)  During construction, the person responsible for implementing the approved plan may request a variance in writing from the plan-approving authority. The plan-approving authority shall respond in writing either approving or disapproving such a request. If the plan-approving authority does not approve a variance within ten (10) days of receipt of the request, the request shall be considered to be disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a variance request with additional documentation. 
(g)  In order to prevent further erosion, the city may require approval of a plan for any land identified as an erosion impact area. 
(h)  When land-disturbing activity will be required of a contractor performing construction work pursuant to a construction contract, the preparation, submission, and approval of an erosion and sediment control plan shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
(i)  Electric, natural gas and telephone utility companies, interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline companies and railroad companies shall file general erosion and sediment control specifications annually with the board for review and written comments. The specifications shall apply to: construction, installation or maintenance of electric, natural gas and telephone utility lines, and pipelines; and; construction of the tracks, rights-of-way, bridges, communication facilities and other related structures and facilities of the railroad company. Individual approval of separate projects within subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection is not necessary when board approved specifications are followed, however, projects included in subdivisions 1 and 2 must comply with board approved specifications. Projects not included in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection shall comply with the requirements of the city's erosion and sediment control program.

Sec. 10-4-6. - Permits; fees; security for performance. 
(a)  Agencies authorized under any other law to issue grading, building, or other permits for activities involving land-disturbing activities may not issue any such permit unless the applicant submits with his application an approved erosion and sediment control plan and certification that the plan will be followed. 
(b)  No person may engage in any land-disturbing activity until he has acquired a land-disturbing permit, unless the proposed land-disturbing activity is specifically exempt from the provisions of this article, and has paid the fees and posted the required bond. 
(c)  An administrative fee shall be paid to the city at the time of each submission of the erosion and sediment control plan which fees shall be set by the city's annual appropriation ordinance. 
(d)  No land-disturbing permit shall be issued until the applicant submits with his application an approved erosion and sediment control plan and certification that the plan will be followed. 
(e)  All applicants for permits shall provide to the city a performance bond, cash escrow, or an irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the director of community development, or their assignee, to ensure that measures could be taken by the city at the applicant's expense should the applicant fail, after proper notice, within the time specified to initiate or maintain appropriate conservation measures required of him as a result of his land-disturbing activity. The amount of the bond or other security for performance shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost to initiate and maintain appropriate conservation action based on the city's list of standard unit prices. Should it be necessary for the city to take such conservation action, the city may collect from the applicant any costs in excess of the amount of the surety held. Within sixty (60) days of adequate stabilization, as determined by the director of community development or their assignee, in any project or section of a project, such bond, cash escrow or letter of credit, or the unexpended or unobligated portion thereof shall be either refunded to the applicant or terminated, based upon the percentage of stabilization accomplished in the project or project section. 
(f)  These requirements are in addition to all other provisions relating to the issuance of permits and are not intended to otherwise affect the requirements for such permits. 
(Ord. of 6-28-11(9)) 
Sec. 10-4-7. - Monitoring, reports and inspections. 
(a)  The city may require the person responsible for carrying out the plan to monitor the land-disturbing activity. The person responsible for carrying out the plan will maintain records of these inspections and maintenance, to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. 
(b)  The director of community development or their assignee shall periodically inspect the land-disturbing activity in accordance with section 4VAC50-30-60 of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. The owner, permittee, or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. If the director of community development or their assignee determines that there is a failure to comply with the plan, notice shall be served upon the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or in the plan certification, or by delivery at the site of the land-disturbing activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. Upon failure to comply within the specified time, the permit may be revoked and the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties provided by this chapter. 
(c)  Upon determination of a violation of this chapter, the director of community development or their assignee may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this chapter, issue an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken. If land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan, the director of community development or their assignee may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this chapter, issue an order requiring that all of the land-disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required permits are obtained. Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where the land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits, such an order may be issued without regard to whether the permittee has been issued a notice to comply as specified in this article. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven (7) days form the date of service pending application by the enforcing authority or permit holder for appropriate relief to the Circuit Court of Rockingham County, Virginia. If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or any required permits within seven (7) days from the date of service of the order, the director of community development or their assignee may issue an order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other than corrective measures, be stopped until an approved plan and any required permits have been obtained. Such an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or the land records of city. The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Circuit Court of Rockingham County, Virginia. Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by director of community development or their assignee may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in the Circuit Court of Rockingham County, Virginia to obey same and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. Upon completion and approval of corrective action or obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the order shall immediately be lifted. Nothing in this section shall prevent the director of community development or their designee from taking any other action authorized by this chapter.

A civil action for such violation or failure may be brought by the city. Any civil penalties assessed by a court shall be paid into the treasury of the city, except that where the violator is the locality itself, or its agent, the court shall direct the penalty to be paid into the state treasury. 
(d)  With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey any regulation or condition of a permit or any provision of this chapter, the city may provide for the payment of civil charges for violations in specific sums, not to exceed the limit specified in subsection (c) of this section. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty which could be imposed under subsection (c). 
(e)  The city's attorney shall, upon request of the city or the permit issuing authority, take legal action to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(f)  Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or equitable proceeding for damages caused by erosion, siltation or sedimentation that all requirements of law have been met, and the complaining party must show negligence in order to recover any damages. 
(Ord. of 6-28-11(9)) 
Sec. 10-4-9. - Civil violations, summons, generally.

(8)  Residential identification signage shall not exceed an aggregate of twenty-four (24) square feet in face area. Said signs shall not exceed six (6) feet in height above grade. No more than two (2) freestanding residential identification signs shall be permitted for each development.

(b)  More than fifty (50) percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than fifty (50) percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation. 
    When one or more of the includable corporations, including the common parent corporation is a nonstock corporation, the term "stock", as used in this subdivision; shall refer to the nonstock corporation membership or membership voting rights, as is appropriate to the context. 
    Assessment: A determination as to the proper rate of tax, the measure to which the tax rate is applied, and ultimately the amount of tax, including additional or omitted tax, that is due. An assessment shall include a written assessment made pursuant to notice by the assessing official or a self-assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or otherwise not pursuant to notice. Assessments shall be deemed made by an assessing official when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by the assessing official or an employee of the assessing official, or mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax is paid. A return filed or tax paid before the last day prescribed by this article for the filing or payment thereof shall be deemed to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return or the payment of tax, as the case may be.

    Contractor shall have the meaning prescribed by section 58.1-3714.B of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, whether such work is done or offered to be done by day labor, general contract or subcontract.

A definite place of business for a person engaged in business may include a location leased or otherwise obtained from another person on a temporary or seasonal basis and real property leased to another. A person's residence shall be deemed to be a definite place of business if there is no definite place of business maintained elsewhere and the person is not subject to licensure as a peddler or itinerant merchant. 
    Financial services: The buying, selling, handling, managing, investing, and providing of advice regarding money, credit, securities, or other investments and shall include the service for compensation by a credit agency, an investment company, a broker or dealer in securities and commodities or a security or commodity exchange, unless such service is otherwise provided for in this article.

    Security, for purposes of this article shall have the same meaning as in the Securities Act (section 13.1-501 et seq.) of the Code of Virginia, or in similar laws of the United States regulating the sale of securities.

    Professional services: Services performed by architects, attorneys-at-law, certified public accountants, dentists, engineers, land surveyors, surgeons, veterinarians, and practitioners of the healing arts (the arts and sciences dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure or alleviation of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities) and such occupations, and no others, as the Department of Taxation may list in the BPOL guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 58.1-3701 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. The department shall identify and list each occupation or vocation in which a professed knowledge of some department of science or learning, gained by a prolonged course of specialized instruction and study is used by its practical application to the affairs of others, either advising, guiding, or teaching them, and in serving their interests or welfare in the practice of an art or science founded on it. The word "profession" implies attainments in professional knowledge as distinguished from mere skill, and the application of knowledge to uses for others rather than for personal profit. 
    Purchases: All goods, wares and merchandise received for sale at each definite place of business of a wholesale merchant. The term shall also include the cost of manufacture of all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by any wholesaler or wholesale merchant and sold or offered for sale.

(Ord. of 11-12-96)

    Every person engaging in the city in any business, trade, profession, occupation or calling (collectively hereinafter "a business"), as defined in this article, unless otherwise exempted by law, shall apply for a license for each such business if (i) such person maintains a definite place of business in the city; (ii) such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does maintain an abode in the city, which abode for the purposes of this article shall be deemed a definite place of business; or (iii) there is no definite place of business but such person operates amusement machines, is engaged as an itinerant merchant or peddler, carnival or circus as specified in sections 58.1-3717, 3718 or 3728, respectively, of the Code of Virginia, or is a contractor subject to section 58.1-3715 of the Code of Virginia, or is a public service corporation subject to section 58.1-3731 of the Code of Virginia. A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business. A person engaged in two (2) or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of the city; (ii) all of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and (iii) the taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96) 
Sec. 12-1-3.1. - Requiring evidence of payment of other licenses and taxes. 
    It shall be unlawful to engage in business, employment or profession without first obtaining the required license and further no business license required by this chapter shall be issued until the applicant has produced satisfactory evidence that all delinquent business license, real estate, personal property, meals, transient occupancy and admissions taxes owed by the business to the city have been paid which have been properly assessed against the applicant by the city. Any person, who engages in a business without obtaining a required local license, or after being refused a license, shall not be relieved of the tax imposed by this chapter. 
(Ord. of 11-9-10(2); Ord. of 11-13-12) 
Sec. 12-1-4. - Due dates and penalties. 
(a)  Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business if he or she was not subject to licensing in this city on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than January thirty-first of the current license year if he or she had been issued a license for the preceding year. Beginning January 1, 1998, any person having been issued a license for the preceding year, or subject to licensing on or before January 1 shall apply for a license no later than March 1 of the current license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the assessing official. 
(b)  The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before January thirty-first and beginning with the calendar year 1998 on or before March first. 
(c)  The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, in which to file an application for a license for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(d)  A penalty of ten (10) percent of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within thirty (30) days, the treasurer may impose a ten (10) percent late payment penalty. The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed shall be abated by the official who assessed them, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he or she acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his or her control. 
    "Acted responsibly" means that (i) the taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business and (ii) the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
    "Events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the assessing official who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information. 
(e)  Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any BPOL tax from the date of payment of due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under section 58.1-3916 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. 
    No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than thirty (30) days from (i) the date of the payment that created the refund, or (ii) the due date of the tax, whichever is later. 
(f)  In the event that said tax, penalty and interest are not paid within ninety (90) days of origination of license by the commissioner of the revenue, and is determined to be the fault of the taxpayer, the treasurer shall notify the business of their noncompliance by letter and phone using the address(s) and phone number(s) provided by the business, to inform said business that unless payment is made in full within fifteen (15) days of notification, business shall be restricted by the installation of a padlock or other restrictive deterrent by the police department and signage shall be posted as to the reason for the closing. Upon payment in full, bringing said business into compliance, the padlock shall be removed and business can resume. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96; Ord. of 11-12-02) 
Sec. 12-1-5. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured in gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within the city. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his or her services are performed, or if his or her services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of section 58.1-3715 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended; 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two (2) or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality; 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then to the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed; and 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at and definite place of business, then to the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule, except as to circumstances set forth in section 58.1-3709 of the Code of Virginia, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to the definite place of business in the city solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than one hundred (100) percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96) 
Sec. 12-1-6. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding section 58.1-3903 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, the assessing official shall assess the city license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six (6) preceding years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any city license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in section 58.1-3940 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, two (2) years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subdivision of this chapter, two (2) years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 12-1-7 (b) or (d) of this chapter, or two (2) years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to section 58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended or similar law for which collections has been stayed, whichever is later. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96) 
Sec. 12-1-7. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an appealable event as defined in this section may apply within one (1) year from the last day of the tax year for which such assessment is made, or within one (1) year from the date of the appealable event, whichever is later, to the assessor for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax periods covered by the challenged assessments, the remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, an audit or further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the application. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an appealable event shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b)  Provided a timely and complete application is made within ninety (90) days of an assessment, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 12-1-4(e) of this chapter, but no further penalty shall be imposed which collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires (i) to depart quickly from the city, (ii) to remove his property therefrom, (iii) to conceal himself or his property therein, or (iv) to do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of a determination, upon an application for correction pursuant to subsection (a), that is adverse to the position asserted by the taxpayer in such application may apply within ninety days of the determination by the assessing official to the tax commissioner of the Commonwealth of Virginia for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within ninety (90) days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to  58.1-1821 of the Code of Virginia, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to  58.1-1822 of the Code of Virginia. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to  58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax commissioner nor the Virginia Department of Taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 12-1-4(e) of this chapter, but no further penalty shall be imposed which collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(e)  Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of a local license tax to a specific situation from the assessor. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentations or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if (i) there is a change in the law, a court decision, or (ii) the assessor notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect. 
(f)  For purposes of this section, "appealable event" means an increase in the assessment of a local license tax payable by a taxpayer, the denial of a refund, or the assessment of a local license tax where none previously was assessed, arising out of the local assessing official's (i) examination of records, financial statements, books of account or other information for the purpose of determining the correctness of an assessment, (ii) determination regarding the rate or classification applicable to the licensable business, (iii) assessment of a local license tax when no return has been filed by the taxpayer, or (iv) denial of an application for correction of erroneous assessment attendant to the filing of an amended application for license. 
(g)  Any taxpayer whose application for correction pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) has been pending for more than two (2) years without the issuance of a final determination may, upon not less than thirty (30) days' written notice to the assessor, elect to treat the application as denied and appeal the assessment to the tax commissioner in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c). The tax commissioner shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision if he finds that the absence of final determination on the part of the assessor was caused by the willful failure or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably needed by the assessor to make his determination. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96; Ord. of 5-27-03) 
Sec. 12-1-8. - Record-keeping and audits. 
    Every person who is assessable with a local license tax shall keep sufficient records to enable the assessor to verify the correctness of the tax paid for the license years assessable and to enable the assessor to ascertain what is the correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those years. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by the assessor in order to allow the assessor to establish whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to the taxable privilege exercised within the city. The assessor shall provide the taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside this jurisdiction, copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the assessor's office upon demand. 
(Ord. of 11-12-96)

Sec. 15-2-1. - Conditions of premises where animals are kept; tethering of dogs. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section: 
    Tether means, when used as a noun, any device, including but not limited to a chain, leash, cable, or tie out, attached to a stationary point or object, trolley or run used to contain or restrain a dog. When used as a verb, tether shall mean to attach a dog to such a device. 
(b)  The party in possession or control of the premises where animals are kept shall ensure that buildings, pens or other areas where animals are kept are maintained in a sanitary, healthy condition. It shall be unlawful to fail to provide any animal with adequate space. "Adequate space" means sufficient space to allow each animal to (i) easily stand, sit, lie, turn about, and make all other normal body movements in a comfortable, normal position for the animal and (ii) interact safely with other animals in the enclosure. 
(c)  When a dog is tethered, "adequate space" means a tether that permits the above actions and is appropriate to the age and size of the dog. The tether must be attached to the dog by a properly applied collar, halter, or harness configured so as to protect the dog from injury and extending over an object or edge that could result in the strangulation or injury of the dog. 
    Furthermore, the tether must be at least three (3) times the length of the dog, as measured from the tip of its nose to the base of its tail, except when the dog is being walked on a leash or is attached by a tether to a lead line. When freedom of movement would endanger the dog, temporarily and appropriately restricting movement of the dog according to professionally accepted standards is considered to be provision of adequate space. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful for any person to tether an unattended dog for more than one hour continuously or four (4) hours cumulatively within any twenty-four (24) hour period, whether or not the tethered dog has been provided adequate space. When the same dog is observed to be tethered in the same location that it was in after an initial observation of the dog in that location, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the dog has been continuously tethered in that location since the initial observation. 
(e)  No person shall tether or cause to be tethered any dog except under all the following conditions: 
(1)  The dog is six (6) months of age or older; 
(2)  If female, the dog is sterilized or not in estrus; 
(3)  The tether does not exceed ten (10) percent of the dog's body weight; and 
(4)  Only one dog is attached to a single tether; 
(f)  The first violation of this section with respect to tethering shall constitute a class 4 misdemeanor, punishable by fine of up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). A second violation (whether or not involving the same dog) within one year of first violation constitutes a class 3 misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00). All subsequent violations within one year of first violation constitute a class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and penalty of up to six (6) months in jail.

An animal on the real property of another, whether restrained or not, without the permission of the person in possession of such real property, shall be construed to be not under control. 
(c)  Any person may, at any time, humanely take temporary control of any animal not under the control of its owner or custodian and immediately notify the police department. 
(d)  This section shall not apply to police, search or rescue dogs engaged in training activities or on official duties. 
(e)  The first violation of this section with respect to spayed or neutered animal shall constitute a Class 4 misdemeanor. Subsequent violations of this section with respect to the same spayed or neutered animal within a one (1) year period, and all violations of this section with respect to non-spayed or non-neutered animals, shall constitute a class 3 misdemeanor, to be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than the maximum permissible by state law.

Cost of caring for the animal while under the temporary control of the investigating officer shall be charged to the custodian of the animal. The investigating officer shall ensure that the animal is cared for in accordance with standards prescribed by the state veterinarian.

Sec. 16-4-63. - Community service work.

If the defendant fails or refuses to complete the community service as ordered by the court, the court may make final disposition of the case and proceed as otherwise provided. If the community service work is completed as the court prescribes, the court may discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is a conviction only for the purposes of applying the ordinance in subsequent proceedings. 
(b)  Community service, to the extent feasible, shall include the repair, restoration or replacement of any damage or defacement to property within the city, and may include clean-up, beautification, landscaping or other appropriate community service within the city.

    This section is enacted pursuant to  15.2-908 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. Whenever the property owner, after reasonable notice, fails to remove or repair the defacement, as defined in this section, of any public building, wall, fence or other structure or any private building, wall, fence or other structure, and where such defacement is visible from any public right-of-way, the city may have such defacement removed or repaired by its agents or employees. Such agents or employees shall have any and all immunity normally provided to an employee of the city. For purposes of this section, the term "defacement" means the unauthorized application by any means of any writing, painting, drawing, etching, scratching, or marking of an inscription, word, mark, figure, or design of any type. 
    If the defacement occurs on a public or private building, wall, fence or other structure located on an unoccupied property, and the city through its own agents or employees, removes or repairs the defacement after complying with the notice provisions of this section, the actual cost or expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such property and may be collected by the city as taxes are collected. No lien shall be chargeable to the owners of such property unless the locality shall have given a minimum of fifteen (15) days notice to the property owner prior to the removal of the defacement. 
    Every charge authorized by this section with which the owner of any such property shall have been assessed and that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property, ranking on a parity with liens of unpaid local taxes and enforceable in the same manner as provided in Articles 3 ( 58.1-3940 et seq.) and 4 ( 58.1-3965 et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended. The city may waive and release such liens in order to facilitate the sale of the property. Such liens may be waived only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has no business association with owner. All such liens shall remain a personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed. 
    Further the Court may order any person convicted of unlawfully defacing property as described above to pay full or partial restitution to the city for costs incurred by the city in removing or repairing the defacement. An order of restitution pursuant to this section shall be docketed as provided in  8.01-446 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, when so ordered by the Court or upon written request of the city and may be enforced by the city in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.

The notice shall further state that failure of the owner or persons having security interests to reclaim the inoperable motor vehicle within the time provided shall constitute a waiver by the owner and all persons having any security interests of all right, title, and interests in the inoperable vehicle, and shall further constitute a consent to the sale of the inoperable motor vehicle at public auction. 
    The costs of removal and disposal as authorized by this section shall be chargeable to the owner of the vehicle or premises and may be collected by the city as taxes are collected. Every cost authorized by this section with which the owner of the premises have been assessed shall constitute a lien against the property from which the vehicle was removed, the lien to continue until actual payment of such costs has been made to the city. 
    Violations of this division shall be subject to a civil penalty, not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first violation, or violations arising from the same set of operative facts. The civil penalty for subsequent violations not arising from the same set of operative facts within twelve (12) months of the first violation shall not exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00). Each business day during which the same violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. In no event shall a series of specified violations arising from the same set of operative facts result in civil penalties that exceed a total of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in a twelve-month period. If three (3) civil penalties are imposed with a twenty-four-month period on the same person for the same or similar violation of this section, not arising out of the same set of operative facts, such person shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor or each subsequent violation. 
    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the owner of such vehicle can demonstrate that he is actively restoring or repairing the vehicle, and if it is shielded or screened from view, the vehicle and one (1) additional inoperative motor vehicle that is shielded or screened from view and being used for the restoration or repair may remain on the property.
