PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Amarillo, Texas of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Code, as amended, and ordinances adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as amended, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    This Code was prepared after an extensive staff review. The fruit of such review was a series of ordinances amending the Code so as to modernize it. The arrangement and numbering system in this Code has been developed with the cooperation of city officers and employees. The Code has been classified by titles. Each title contains chapters. After Title II, each odd-numbered title has been reserved for future use. The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    Each section of the Code is identified with its title and chapter number and any additions can be inserted in their proper place by the use of the decimal system. New material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-4-22 and 2-4-23 would be designated as sections 2-4-22.1, 2-4-22.2 and 2-4-22.3, respectively. When appropriate sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions for future expansion. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2-4 and 2-5 it will be designated as Chapter 2-4.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the cases of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Special Feature 
    A unique feature of the Code is the capitalization scheme. This scheme was developed by the city. In addition to capitalizing the titles of officials and departments, defined terms are capitalized. As Code section 1-2-1 provides that definitions apply throughout the Code, terms defined in section 4-10-3 are applicable throughout the Code. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Merril Nunn, City Attorney, and former Assistant City Manager, Mr. Mark F. Sowa, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(d)  The cost of such improvements may be wholly paid by the City of Amarillo, or partly by the City and partly by property abutting upon the highway or portion thereof ordered to be improved and the owners of such property; but if any part of the cost is to be paid by such abutting property and the owners, then before any such improvements are actually constructed, and before any hearing herein provided for is held, the governing body shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, an estimate of the cost of such improvements, and in no event shall more than all the cost of constructing, reconstructing, repairing and realigning curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, and nine-tenths of the remaining cost of such improvements as shown on such estimate be assessed against such abutting property and owners thereof. 
(e)  If improvements be ordered constructed in any part of the area between and under rails, tracks, double tracks, turn-outs and switches, and two feet on each side thereof, of any railway, street railway, or interurban, using, occupying, or crossing any such highway, portion or portions thereof, ordered improved, then the governing body shall have power to assess the whole cost of the improvements in such area against such railway, street railway, or interurban, and shall have power, by Ordinance, to levy a special tax upon such railway, street railway, or interurban, and its roadbed, ties, rails, fixtures, rights and franchises, which tax shall constitute a lien thereon superior to any other lien or claim except State, County, and City ad valorem taxes, and which may be enforced either by sale of said property in the manner provided by law for the collection of ad valorem taxes by the City, or by suit in any court having jurisdiction. 
The Ordinance levying such tax shall prescribe the time, terms and conditions of payment thereof, and the rate of interest, not to exceed eight percent (8 percent) per annum, and same, if not paid when due, shall be collectible, together with interest, expenses of collection and reasonable attorneys fees if incurred. 
The governing body of the City of Amarillo shall have power to cause to be issued assignable certificates in evidence of any such assessments as hereinafter provided. 
(f)  Subject to the terms hereof, the governing body of the City of Amarillo shall have power by Ordinance to assess all the cost of constructing, reconstructing, repairing and realigning curbs, gutters and sidewalks, and not exceeding nine-tenths of the estimated cost of such improvements, exclusive of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, against property abutting upon the highway or portion thereof ordered to be improved, and against the owners of such property, and to provide the time, terms and conditions of payments and defaults of such assessments, and to prescribe the rate of interest thereon, not to exceed eight percent (8 percent) per annum. 
Any assessments against abutting property shall be a first and prior lien thereon from the date the improvements are ordered, and shall be a personal liability and charge against the true owners of such property at said date, whether named or not. 
The governing body of the City of Amarillo shall have power to cause to be issued in the name of the City of Amarillo assignable certificates in evidence of assessments levied declaring the lien upon the property and the liability of the true owners thereof, whether correctly named or not, and to fix the terms and conditions of such certificates. 
If any such certificate shall recite substantially that the proceedings with reference to making the improvements therein referred to have been regularly had in compliance with the law and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property described in said certificate and the personal liability of the owner of owners thereof have been performed, same shall be prima facie evidence of all the matters recited in said certificate, and no further proof thereof shall be required. 
In any suit upon any assessment or reassessment in evidence of which a certificate may be issued under the terms hereof, it shall be sufficient to allege the substance of the recitals in such certificate, and that such recitals are in fact true, and further allegations with reference to the proceedings relating to such assessment or reassessment shall not be necessary. 
Such assessments shall be collectible with interest, expense of collections, and reasonable attorneys' fee, if incurred, and shall be a first and prior lien on the property assessed, superior to all other liens and claims except State, County and City ad valorem taxes, and shall be personal liability and charge against the owners of the property assessed. 
(g)  The part of the cost of improvements on each portion of highway ordered improved which may be assessed against abutting property and owners thereof shall be apportioned among the parcels of abutting property and owners thereof, in accordance with the Front Foot Plan or Rule, provided that if the application of this rule would, in the opinion of the governing body of the City of Amarillo, in particular cases, result in injustice or inequality it shall be the duty of said body to apportion and assess said costs in such proportion as it may deem just and equitable, having in view the special benefits in enhanced value to be received by such parcels of property and owners thereof, the equities of such owners, and the adjustment of such apportionment so as to produce a substantial equality of benefits received and burdens imposed. 
(h)  Nothing herein shall empower the City of Amarillo, or its governing body, to fix a lien against any interest in property exempt, at the time the improvements are ordered, from the lien of special assessments for street improvements, but the owner or owners of such property shall nevertheless be personally liable for any assessment in connection with such property. The fact that any improvement, though ordered, is omitted in front of property, any interest in which is so exempt, shall not invalidate the lien or liability of assessments made against other property. 
The lien created against any property and the personal liability of the owner or owners thereof may be enforced by suit in any court having jurisdiction, or by sale of the property assessed in the same manner as may be provided by law or Charter in force in the City of Amarillo for sale of property for ad valorem city taxes. 
(i)  No assessment herein provided for shall be made against any abutting property or its owners, nor against any railway, street railway or interurban, or owner, until after notice, and opportunity for hearing as herein provided, and no assessment shall be made against any abutting property or owners thereof in excess of the special benefits of such property, and its owners in the enhanced value thereof by means of such improvements as determined at such hearing. 
Such notice shall be as provided by applicable state law or in the absence of such law, by advertisement inserted at least three times in some newspaper published in and of general circulation in the City of Amarillo, the first publication to be made at least ten days before the date of the hearing. 
If any such notice shall describe in general terms the nature of the improvements for which assessments are proposed to be levied, and to which such notice relates, shall state the highway, highways, portion or portions thereof, to be improved, shall state the estimated amount or amounts per front foot proposed to be assessed against the owner or owners of abutting property, and such property on each highway or portion, with reference to which hearing mentioned in the notice is to be held, and shall state the estimated total cost of the improvements on each such highway, portion or portions thereof, and if the improvements are to be constructed in any part of the area, between and under rails, tracks, double tracks, turn-outs, and switches, and two feet on each side thereof of any railway, street railway, or interurban, shall also state the amount proposed to be assessed therefore, and shall state the time and place at which such hearing shall be held, then such notice shall be sufficient, valid and binding upon all owning or claiming such abutting property, or any interest therein, and upon all owning or claiming such railway, street railway, or interurban, or any interest therein.

(a)  Establishment of administrative adjudication. For accused violators desiring to contest a notice of violation, this Article provides for a system of civil administrative hearings for the following motor vehicle violations, which are deemed to be civil nuisances and not criminal offenses: 
(1)  All stopping, standing, and parking violations, except any identified as criminal offenses in Section 1-1-5(e)(1) of this Code of Ordinances; and 
(2)  All traffic signal photographic enforcement cases, as provided for in Article XII of Chapter 16-3 of this Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  Hearing officers . A sufficient number of hearing officers shall be appointed by the city manager. Such officers shall have authority to administer oaths and to issue orders compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, such orders to be enforced by the municipal court. For budgeting purposes or administrative convenience, the city manager may assign the Office of Civil Hearings to a City department, but oversight of these appointees shall remain in the city manager or designee. Hearing officer is disqualified and shall not preside over any case in which the officer has a business relationship; a familial relationship within the third degree by blood or second degree by marriage; or, is otherwise unable to render a fair and unbiased opinion. In such a case, the hearing officers may exchange cases to avoid the conflict or bias if possible, or a special hearing officer to hear such case, as designated by the City Manager. 
(c)  Notice of right to hearing; notice of time and place of scheduled hearings. Notice of a parking violation pursuant to Section 1-1-5(e) may be affixed to the vehicle in a manner reasonably assured that it will be seen by the operator, or handed to the operator, if present. A notice of violation for a traffic signal photographic enforcement system shall be mailed to the registered owner as provided in Chapter 16-3, Article XII. Upon receipt of a notice of violation, the owner receiving a notice of violation must either timely pay the civil penalty or, alternatively, timely appear at the place, time, and day indicated in the notice of violation for an administrative hearing or as stated in a subsequent notice to appear mailed to the address on the State's vehicle title registration records or operator's driver's license address, if allowed for the type of violation being noticed. 
(Ord. No. 7780, § 1, 3-26-2019) 
Sec. 2-8-201. - Hearing procedures. 
(a)  Right to hearing . A person who receives a notice of violation advising the violator of a right to a civil administrative hearing may contest the imposition of the civil penalty for the violation by timely appearing or making a written request for administrative hearing as specified in the notice of violation. 
(b)  Evidence . In a civil administrative hearing, the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. In addition to any other competent evidence offered at the hearing, the hearing officer is authorized to accept the following presumptive and prima facie evidence: 
(1)  Presumption . It is presumed that the registered title owner of the vehicle that is the subject of the hearing is the person who parked or stopped the vehicle at the time and place of the offense charged, if the actual operator is not known. 
(2)  Prima facie evidence . (i) A computer generated record of the State of Texas vehicle title data base indicating the registered vehicle owner is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein; (ii) The original or copy of the summons or citation is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein; and (iii) The failure or refusal of a person charged with a violation to appear at the hearing shall be deemed an admission of liability for the charged civil nuisance violation. 
(c)  Affirmative defenses . It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this Article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
(1)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle being operated by a person without the effective consent of the Owner; 
(2)  The vehicle in violation was, at the time of violation, either stolen or was displaying a stolen license plate. To establish that the vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate at the time of the violation, the Owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been promptly and previous to the violation reported to an appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(3)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other extenuating condition prevented strict compliance; or 
(4)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the Owner of the motor-vehicle at the time of the violation, as evidenced by a bill of sale or prior transfer or assignment of the State certificate of title for that motor vehicle. 
(d)  Record of hearing; other procedures . The record of witness testimony shall be preserved by the use of an audio tape recording or a video tape recording for appellant review. Other procedures for conducting a hearing under this Article shall be as stated in Chapter 16-3, Article XII. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between that Article XII and this Article, this Article shall prevail for hearings conducted pursuant to Section 1-1-5(e)(3). 
(e)  Entry of Order . At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a signed and dated order stating whether the person charged with the violation is liable for the violation and if so, shall re-state the penalty amount and describe the right to appeal to municipal court in accordance with other provisions of this Article. 
(f)  Retention of records . The orders issued under this section together with any affidavits and other documents associated with each hearing or appeal shall be filed with and maintained by the Office of Civil Hearings, in a separate index and file for each hearing, either in hardcopy or electronic form. Such information shall be retained for the period specified by State law. 
(Ord. No. 7780, § 1, 3-26-2019) 
Sec. 2-8-202. - Appeal. 
(a)  A person who is found liable after an administrative hearing may appeal that determination of civil liability to the municipal court, by filing both: (1) a written notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipal court not later than the 31 st day after the date on which the administrative hearing officer entered the written finding of civil liability; and (2) a notarized statement of personal financial obligation (that is, either post a bond or sign a promissory note that is immediately due and payable upon entry of a judgment of liability by the municipal court and providing for recovery of the City's reasonable attorney fees and court costs for collection of the note, and providing for waiver of notice, presentment, and demand) in the amount of the civil penalty; and, (3) paying the applicable civil court appeal fee of twenty-seven dollars ($27.00). 
(b)  Collection or enforcement of the civil penalty is stayed during the period allowed for perfecting an appeal and during the pendency of the appeal. 
(c)  The clerk of the municipal court shall set the matter for a trial-by judge as expeditiously as possible on the court's docket and issue notice of the date, time and place of the trial to the appellant and the City attorney's office. The appeal shall be conducted as a civil trial de novo and all issues determined by the judge upon a preponderance of the evidence. The municipal judge shall allow into evidence all affidavits, prima facie evidence, or presumptions which were filed or allowed in the administrative hearing, subject to such evidence being further challenged or rebutted in the municipal court trial. 
(d)  At the conclusion of the trail, the trial judge shall enter a written judgment declaring whether the person is liable for the nuisance and civil penalty stated in this Article or is not liable for same. A person found liable in the municipal court trial shall immediately pay the civil penalty and any outstanding costs prescribed by this Article. The court is authorized to immediately collect the civil penalty by cash, credit card, or by immediately proceeding against any bond or note posted by the person. If the person is exonerated, then the statement of personal financial obligation required to perfect the appeal shall be immediately released. 
(Ord. No. 7780, § 1, 3-26-2019) 
Sec. 2-8-203. - Nature of liability; collection. 
(a)  The imposition of a civil penalty under this Article is not a criminal conviction for any purpose and shall not be reported to any insurance company or state agency that issues driver licenses or maintains driving records. However, a failure to pay the civil penalty or a late fee may be enforced or collected as follows: 
(b)  Vehicle impoundment . If a vehicle has been the subject of six (6) or more civil nuisance violations (that is, a civil stopping, standing, or parking offense pursuant to section 1-1-5(e); a red light camera violation; or, a combination of those violations) within the prior twelve (12) months, or a sum of three hundred dollar ($300.00) or more is then past due for unpaid civil penalties or costs, and that vehicle is again found parked on a public street, alley, right-of-way, easement, or government owned property, then the police may impound the vehicle in accordance with the procedures then in place for non-consent towing (see, chapter 10-3, Article VII). The vehicle owner is then liable for payment of outstanding parking penalties, any costs that have been assessed by a hearing officer, and the fees owed to the towing company, all of which must be paid before the vehicle will be released. In accordance with Texas Occupation Code, Chapter 2308, Subchapter J, a person who believes his/her vehicle was towed without probable cause is entitled to a hearing in justice of the peace court, upon timely request for a hearing on that issue. 
(b)  Hold on vehicle registration . As provided by Texas Transportation Code § 702.003 reporting to the Texas Department of Transportation an outstanding and unpaid penalty and costs assessed against that vehicle, by a hearing officer or municipal judge. A county may thereafter refuse to re-register the vehicle until the amount is paid to the City. 
(c)  Other civil action . Unless prohibited by other law, the city attorney or designee is authorized to file suit and to take other reasonable steps to collect the civil penalty and any fees imposed. 
(Ord. No. 7780, § 1, 3-26-2019) 
Sec. 2-8-204. - No double violations. 
    A civil penalty may not be imposed under this Article on the Owner of a vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a citation or summons to appear in municipal court for the same violation. However, a civil penalty may be imposed on the vehicle Owner for the violation, if the arrest, citation, or summons of the vehicle operator is for a different violation of law than the notice of violation of a civil nuisance as defined in this Code of Ordinances.

The Building Official shall also cause the Dangerous Structure to be secured from unlawful entry if the Interested Persons who received the Initial notice fail, refuse or neglect to so secure the place by the tenth day after receipt of such notice. 
(c)  Provisional permit; opportunity to cure or remove structure. 
(1)  If the Interested Persons in the property cannot secure the Dangerous Structure and remedy the defects within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice, but desires more time to do so, then the Interested Persons must apply for a provisional permit within the ten (10) days from the date such notice is received. A provisional permit authorizes the Interested Persons to either remove the structure in accordance with this Code of Ordinances or take such corrective remedial work that can be substantially complete within sixty (60) days, as agreed in writing with the Building Official. 
(2)  The Building Official shall issue a provisional permit for the agreed corrective work or removal of the structure when the Interested Persons (i) demonstrates the structure has been temporarily secured as required in the notice letter; (ii) tenders a plan and schedule of work that is feasible to accomplish within sixty (60) days or less, in consideration of: the season; availability of materials; skills of the owner or availability of skilled or licensed contractors in the local market; the scope and amount of work to be performed; and other objective factor reasonably bearing on likelihood of success of the endeavor; (iii) demonstrates reasonably adequate financial resources to accomplish the agreed corrective work within sixty (60) days, such as cash on hand, revenue stream, pre-approved loan, line of credit or a combination of these or other liquid resources readily available to allow substantial completion within sixty (60) days; and, (iv) pays the required fee of three hundred forty-five dollars ($345.00) for the permit.

Apart from any ordinarily required construction inspection as required by another applicable code, the Building Official shall cause an abatement re-inspection of the property after the 60th day, and shall issue a written determination that either: finds substantial completion of the work authorized by the provisional permit (and thereupon may grant an extension of the provisional permit as provided for above or issue a standard building permit and other permits for additional work to continue on the Structure); or, finds that there is not substantial compliance and the condemnation process provided in this Article shall continue. 
(d)  Prosecution. Failure, refusal or neglect of the Interested Persons in a Dangerous Structure to abate such a nuisance after the Initial Notice of violation is an offense punishable in accordance with section 1-1-5. However, the Building official shall delay filing of any charges in municipal court until such as time as there is probable cause to believe that the Interested Persons shall fail, neglect or refuse: (1) to comply with the Initial Notice of violation and need to secure or to repair the Dangerous Structure; or (2) to demolish the Dangerous Structure or portion thereof; or, (3) to timely and substantially complete the terms of a provisional permit, then the Building Official may proceed to prosecute same in the Amarillo Municipal Court. 
(e)  Notice of Condemnation Hearing. 
(1)  In the event that the Interested Persons shall fail, neglect or refuse: (1) to comply with the Initial Notice of violation to repair or rehabilitate: or (2) to demolish the Dangerous Structure or portion thereof; or, (3) to timely and substantially complete the terms of a provisional permit, then the Building Official shall cause to be presented to the Condemnation Appeals Commission a resolution setting a date for a condemnation hearing, which allows for not less than ten (10) days notice to the Interested Persons in the property, and ordering that a written notice of such hearing be promptly sent to such person(s) at the last known address for such person(s), and by publication of a notice of such hearing one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation in the City prior to the date of such hearing. In addition, the Building Official may post notice of the hearing on the property. 
(f)  Conduct of Hearing. 
(1)  The chairman of the Commission or acting chairperson in the absence of the chairman shall announce the case and administer an oath or affirmation to all persons desiring to testify in the matter. 
(2)  The Building Official or designee shall present photographs, documents, and other relevant and material testimony and evidence concerning (i) the conditions existing on and at the property; (ii) problems and nuisances arising out of same, (iii) the notices sent or effort to locate Interested Persons; and (iv) the existence and status of any provisional permit or reasons for denial of same by the Building Official. At the conclusion of the Building Official's testimony, the chairman shall admit the file into the record of the proceeding and for individual review and questioning by any Condemnation Appeals Commission member. 
(3)  The Interested Persons in the property shall then have the right to cross-examine the Building Official or designee and challenge any aspect of the evidence or testimony offered by the Building Official. The Interested Persons shall then be allowed to offer direct testimony, photos, and other relevant and material evidence in support of that person's position or in opposition to the Building Official. 
(4)  Any other person desiring to offer testimony about the matter shall then be heard by the Condemnation Appeals Commission. 
(5)  If the Interested Persons who were sent notice of the hearing fails, refuses, or neglects to appear at the hearing, then such person is deemed to admit liability for the defects and violations stated in the initial notice. 
(6)  The Condemnation Appeals Commission may adopt such other procedural rules it deems reasonable and helpful for the conduct of such hearings. The chair shall, in consultation with the City Attorney as needed, rule on all procedural questions in order to do substantial justice with due regard for notions of fair play, judicial efficiency, private property rights, and public health and safety concerns posed by the condition of property. 
(7)  Upon conclusion of all testimony from interested persons, the chair shall close the hearing. The Condemnation Appeals Commission shall publicly deliberate its decision, giving due consideration to and weighing the following factors: validity of the violations as alleged by the Building Official; the severity of such violations and any corresponding danger to the public; due regard for private property rights; fair opportunity for the Interested Persons to have been notified of the problems and a corresponding opportunity to repair, remediate, or remove the defects or Dangerous Structure; weighing the private property interests of neighbors affected by further delay or deterioration of the subject property; and any other relevant consideration unique to the circumstances of that case but which may materially affect due process and equal protection of involved persons. The Condemnation Appeals Commission shall then announce its decision during that meeting and issue its resolution order: 
(i)  Finding that the Structure is not a dangerous one or one marked by accumulation of vegetation, debris or trash, and ordering the matter be dismissed and City to dismiss the notice filed in the county real property records; or, 
(ii)  Finding the Structure or any other improvement of any kind, or any part thereof, is dangerous and ordering its removal ten (10) days after notice of decision; or, 
(iii)  Finding the Structure is a danger and ordering its removal ten (10) days after notice of decision, however, further finding that good cause exists to grant a reprieve on that order to allow the Interested Persons in the property to seek to qualify for and obtain a provisional permit during that period, and if obtained then the reprieve shall continue for the duration of such permit or successor permit, as provided in this Section. The reprieve granted under this subsection shall expire upon the later of the expiration of time to apply for and obtain a provisional permit or the expiration of such permit. If at expiration of the reprieve the Building Official finds that the defects that gave rise to the finding of a Dangerous Structure have been abated, then the prior order of the Condemnation Appeals Commission to remove the Structure is moot; or, if the defects remain, then the Building Official shall proceed to carry out the Condemnation Appeals Commission's prior order to remove the Dangerous Structure; or, 
(iv)  Finding good cause exists to defer the adjudication of the case and directing reinstatement or extension of a prior provisional permit, for a period of time determined by the Condemnation Appeals Commission not exceeding sixty (60) days from date of the hearing. If at the end of the deferral period, the Building Official finds that there has been no substantial progress toward abatement of the defects, the Building Official shall request the Condemnation Appeals Commission to set a new hearing and proceed with an adjudication of whether the Structure is dangerous or not, in accordance with the procedures of subsection (e). 
(g)  Notice of Decision. A copy of the decision (resolution, order, or other document) of the Condemnation Appeals Commission shall be promptly sent to the Interested Persons in the Dangerous Structure or Premises in the same manner provided in subsection (b)(3) of this Section. 
(h)  Default; assessment of costs; lien; law suit. 
(1)  If the Interested Persons shall fail, refuse, or neglect: (i) to remove or remedy the Dangerous Structure in accordance with the Condemnation Appeals Commission's resolution order not later than ten (10) days after notice of same is sent or posted; or (ii) either to apply for or to timely and substantially perform the terms of a provisional permit or extended provisional permit as ordered by the Condemnation Appeals Commission. (iii) or to timely and fully comply with the terms of a deferred adjudication, then the Building Official shall proceed to execute the Condemnation Appeals Commission's finding and order to remove the Dangerous Structure. 
(2)  All expenses incurred by the City in the course of sending notices, removing and disposing of the Dangerous Structure or other improvements, as well as any other work performed on the premises or Structure, shall be invoiced to the owner of the property, with notice to any occupant and lien holder of record. 
(3)  If the Interested Persons in the Premises shall fail, refuse, or neglect for a period of thirty (30) days to pay or discharge the expenses assessed by the City, then the City shall have a privileged lien second only to tax liens, and may file a record of such lien against such property in the appropriate county deed records, which shall bear interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum or as otherwise allowed by law. In no case shall the City foreclose such lien by forced sale, except as may otherwise be prescribed by applicable state law. 
(4)  Apart from any other action, right, or remedy mentioned in this section, the City Attorney may file a civil law suit for any or all of the following: injunctive relief, declaratory judgment against the nuisance, for recovery of expenses incurred with interest.

The security shall be issued in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the cost estimate approved by the City Engineer for all public improvements associated with the subdivision. Surety instruments provided must be issued by a financial entity located within three hundred fifty (350) miles of the City of Amarillo. The security shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney. 
(c)  Security in the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Where the land to be platted lies within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Amarillo, the security shall be in a form and contain such terms as are consistent with an interlocal agreement between the City and the county under Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 242, where the proposed development is located in whole or in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and in the county. In cases where the requirements governing the form and terms of the security are defined in such an agreement, they will supersede any conflicting provisions of Subsection (a), (b), and (c) above. 
(d)  Partial Release . As portions of the public improvements are completed in accordance with the City of Amarillo regulations, and the approved public improvement plans, the developer may make application to the City Engineer to reduce the amount of the original letter of credit, bond or cash escrow. If the City Engineer is satisfied that such portion of the improvements has been completed in accordance with city policies, he may cause the amount of the letter of credit, bond or cash escrow to be reduced by such amount that he deems appropriate, so that the remaining amount of the letter of credit or bond or cash escrow adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements. 
(1)  Public improvements secured with a letter of credit, bond, or cash, and deemed completed and available for partial release will have passed all testing requirements of the applicable portions of the City of Amarillo's technical specifications. The value of completed improvements available for partial release will be the total value of the public improvement outlined in the development agreement minus any associated appurtenances required to insure the completion of the remaining related public improvements. Developer's application for release must provide a detailed estimate of costs provided by an Engineer of Record certifying that to the best of the engineer's knowledge the quantity of work requested for surety release is accurate related to the completed improvement. 
(2)  For public improvements secured with the cash escrow option before construction begins, a developer may request a partial release of the cash surety through a formal written request to the City Engineer. Developer's application for release must provide a detailed estimate of costs provided by an Engineer of Record certifying that to the best of the engineer's knowledge the quantity of work requested for surety release is accurate related to the installed improvement. The release of funds will be based on the level of detail and amounts provided in the schedule of values identified within the executed Developer Agreement. An amount equal to thirty (30) percent of the partial release request will be retained until such time the improvements have passed all testing requirements and are considered acceptable by the City Engineer. The frequency of this type of partial release request must meet appropriate policy guidelines and contract documents established by the City Engineer. 
(3)  The Assistant City Manager of Development Services and other necessary City officials shall execute any documents necessary to cause release of any portion of the security in accordance with this provision, provided that all such documents shall be subject to approval by the City Attorney. 
(4)  No partial release shall be granted where any substantial part of work performed prior to the date of the application fails to meet City standards and specifications for any release other than incompleteness. 
(e)  Warranty and Maintenance. In addition to providing security as described in (a) above, the Developer or contractor shall also provide a warranty for the improvements for a period of one (1) year following acceptance by the City and shall provide a maintenance bond in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the costs of the improvements for such period.

If the City Engineer and Director of Utilities find upon inspection (prior to acceptance and dedication and within the surety or warranty period) that any of the required public improvements have not been constructed properly and in accordance with the approved Construction Plans, the Developer, or the party which the City has executed an agreement for the improvements with, shall be responsible for properly completing and/or correcting the public improvements. 
(b)  Submission of Record Drawings. The City shall not accept dedication of required public improvements until the contractor or the Developer's Engineer has provided to the City Engineer a detailed record drawing, when appropriate, or detailed information that includes changes made by change order or field order, revised plans or other matters not originally specified, showing the location, dimensions, materials, and other information to establish that the public improvements have been built in accordance with the approved Construction Plans and to reflect actual construction.

(3)  The City Engineer shall reject such construction only if it fails to comply with standards and specification of the City of Amarillo. 
    If the City Engineer rejects such construction, the City Attorney shall, on direction of the City Manager, proceed to enforce the guarantee provided by agreements called for in this section; and 
(4)  If the City Engineer accepts such construction, the City shall execute all the necessary documents to release the full amount of security, including any retainage. The City Engineer shall issue a letter to the Developer stating that all required public improvements have been satisfactorily completed. Acceptance of the improvements shall mean that the Developer has transferred all rights to all the public improvements to the City for use and maintenance. 
(d)  Disclaimer. Approval of a Preliminary Plan or Final Plat shall not constitute acceptance of any of the public improvements required to serve the subdivision or development. No public improvements shall be accepted for dedication by the City except in accordance with this Division. 
(e)  Acceptance of Improvements in the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Where the facilities to be constructed under the Subdivision Improvement Agreement are located within the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, and are to be dedicated to a county, the City Engineer shall inform the county that the public improvements have been constructed in accordance with approved Construction Plans, and are ready for acceptance by the county.

See the Code Comparative Table for a complete derivation. 

Sec. 4-6-65. - Policy established. 
(a)  Adequate Public Facilities Policy. Land proposed for development in the City and in the City's Extraterritorial Jurisdiction must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including water, wastewater, roadway, and drainage facilities. Land shall not be approved for platting or development unless and until adequate public facilities necessary to serve the development exist or provision has been made for the facilities, whether the facilities are to be located within the property being developed or off-site. 
(b)  Responsibility of the Developer to Provide. The Developer shall be responsible for the following to ensure that public facilities provided are adequate: 
(1)  Phasing of development or improvements in order to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities; 
(2)  Extensions of public facilities and roadways (including any necessary on-site and off-site facilities) to connect to existing public facilities or roadways to the development; 
(3)  Providing and/or procuring all necessary property interests, including rights-of-way and easements, for the facilities (whether on-site or off-site), 
(4)  Providing proof to the City of adequate public facilities; 
(5)  Making provisions for future expansion of the public facilities as needed to serve future developments, in coordination with the City's oversize participation regulations (i.e., when the City will provide for the cost of over-sizing facilities), if applicable; 
(6)  Providing for all operations and maintenance of the public facilities, or if the City is not the provider, providing proof that a separate entity will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the facilities; 
(7)  Providing all fiscal security required for the construction of the public facilities; 
(8)  Obtaining approvals from any applicable utility providers other than the City; and 
(9)  Comply with all requirements of utility providers, including the City or other applicable providers. 
(c)  Responsibility of the Developer to Conform to Adopted Plans. The Developer shall ensure that facilities provided are consistent with the City's adopted plans. 
(1)  Proposed facilities serving new development shall conform to and be properly related to the public facility elements of the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan, other adopted master plans for public facilities and services, and applicable capital improvement plans, and shall meet the service levels specified in such plans. 
(2)  The design and construction of all water and wastewater facilities to serve the subdivision shall be in conformance with the City's master plans for water and wastewater facilities and with the City's technical specifications. 
(d)  Study Required. If a Developer seeking approval of a Plat or Construction Plan for which an exaction requirement is imposed as a condition of approval, believes the exaction requirement is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impact created by the proposed development, then the Developer shall state in writing the reasons for such and shall provide a study in support of such position. The City Engineer shall evaluate the study and shall make a determination based upon analysis of the information contained in the study. The City Engineer shall notify, in writing, the Developer of the determination. The Developer's study shall, at a minimum, include the following information, and may also contain other pertinent data and analysis: 
(1)  Total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, storm water, or roadway system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of the capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases, such information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed, including any phases already developed; 
(2)  Total capacity to be supplied to the City's water, wastewater, storm water, or roadway system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land or construction of capital improvements. If the development application is part of a phased development, the information shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedications or construction of capital improvements; 
(3)  Comparison of the capacity of the City's public facilities system(s) to be consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such system(s) by the proposed dedication of an interest in land or construction of capital improvements. In making this comparison, the impacts on the City's public facilities system(s) from the entire development shall be considered; 
(4)  The effect of any City participation in the costs of oversizing the capital improvement to be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements; 
(5)  Any other information that shows the allege disproportionality between the impacts created by the proposed development and the dedication or construction requirement imposed by the City; 
(6)  This proportionality analysis should not only be based on any immediate plans for the property, but should be based on the size of the property, existing use of the property, the existing zoning, and what impacts the highest and best use of the property could have on the City's infrastructure system; and 
(7)  Only costs directly related to the dedication or construction requirement should be included in the analysis. Indirect costs, such as applications, permits, and fees, shall not be included. 
(e)  Responsible Official. The City Engineer is the Responsible Official for an appeal for relief from a dedication or construction requirement. Where the appeal is for relief from dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of a facility in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction that is to be dedicated to the public, the City Engineer may coordinate a recommendation with the county official responsible for reviewing plats in the county. 
(f)  Evaluation and decision. The Development Review Committee shall make an initial review of the appeal and supporting study and shall provide comments to the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall evaluate the appeal, the supporting study, and the Development Review Committee comments and shall make a determination based upon the information contained in the Developer's study, any comments received from the county and Development Review Committee, and the City Engineer's own analysis of pertinent data and the circumstances of the case. 
(g)  Adjustments. If the City Engineer is persuaded by the materials considered under the preceding subsection, then the City Engineer is authorized to make reasonable and necessary adjustments to infrastructure requirements, exactions, required dedications, and similar, so as to render such roughly proportionate to the impact of the development on the City's facilities. In most instances where an adjustment is warranted, a reduction of the requirements would likely be most appropriate, rather than a complete waiver of dedication or construction requirements. 
(Ord. No. 7507, §§ 3, 4, 3-3-2015) 
Sec. 4-6-66. - Appeal. 
(a)  Purpose and Policy. The purpose of an appeal of the City Engineer's determination that the routine application of uniform dedication and construction standards to a proposed plat does not result in a disproportionate burden on the property owner, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed plat on the City's public facilities systems relative to what is normal and reasonable for other similar subdivisions of property. 
(b)  Appeal. A Developer who disputes the determination made under this article may appeal to the City Council as provided in the Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 212.904, as amended. 
(c)  Procedure. The developer seeking relief from a required dedication, allocation of construction cost, or other exaction shall allege that application of the standard requirement is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the City's water, wastewater, storm water, other utility, roadway system, or other public facility as the case may be, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development. The appeal shall be in the form of a letter to the City Manager explaining the Developer's grounds and reasoning for why the Developer believes the requirements are not proportional to the development's impact on City facilities. The City Manager shall forward the appeal letter to the City Council for consideration, together with all evaluation materials produced or considered by the City Engineer and Development Review Committee under the preceding section, including the Study submitted by the Developer in the preceding section. 
(d)  Time for Filing. An appeal shall be filed within ten (10) business days after the City Engineer's determination of the matter. 
(e)  Public Hearing; Burden of Proof. The City Council shall promptly schedule and conduct a public hearing after the appeal letter is received from the City Manager. The Developer bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that the City Engineer's determination results in a disproportionate burden on the Developer. 
(f)  Action. Within thirty (30) days after the Public Hearing, the City Council shall determine the matter and issue one of the following actions: 
(1)  Deny the appeal, and impose the standard or condition in accordance with the initial decision; 
(2)  Deny the appeal, and further require that additional dedications of rights-of-way for or improvements to such systems, or other requirements, be made as a condition of approval of the application in order to adequately offset the impacts of the development; 
(3)  Grant the appeal and waive part or all of a dedication or construction requirement to the extent necessary to achieve proportionality; or 
(4)  Grant the appeal and further direct that the City participate in some or all of the costs of constructing the capital improvement under standard participation policies. 
(g)  Notification of Decision. The Developer shall be notified of the City Council's decision by the City Engineer within five (5) business days after the decision. 
(h)  Judicial review. The Developer may appeal the City Council's decision as provided by State law.

ARTICLE V. - SERVICE PROVIDER USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT(S)-OF-WAY 

Sec. 4-6-200. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  Public and private uses of Public Right(s)-of-Way for location of Facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the City must insure that the primary purpose of the Right(s)-of-Way, passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, City utility system, Facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the Public Right(s)-of-Way corridors by private users is secondary to these public objectives and to the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of Public Right(s)-of-Way for location of public and private Facilities. The article thus has several objectives: 
(1)  To insure that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
(2)  To protect the City's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, Facilities, and property in the Public Right(s)-of-Way, when work is accomplished. 
(3)  To facilitate work within the Public Right(s)-of-Way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  To maintain an efficient permit process. 
(5)  To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of the Public Right(s)-of-Way held in public trust by the City. 
(6)  To establish a public policy for enabling the City to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition, and technological development. 
(7)  To promote cooperation among the Service Providers and the City in the occupation of the Public Right(s)-of-Way, and work therein, in order to eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly, lower the Service Providers' and the City's costs of providing services to the public, and preserve the physical integrity of the Streets, Alleys, Easements and highways by minimizing Pavement Cuts. 
(8)  To assure that the City can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  This article does not grant any rights to use or occupy the City's Right(s)-of-Way but is intended to impose reasonable regulations on the use of the Public Right(s)-of-Way by persons authorized by License and Hold Harmless Agreements, franchises and/or by law to place and maintain equipment and Facilities within the Public Right(s)-of-Way.

The City shall be responsible for maintaining its respective Facilities buried in the Service Provider's trenches and bores under this paragraph. Service Provider(s) shall have reciprocal rights in City trenches or bores except trenches and bores for water and sewer lines and when prohibited by applicable ordinances or codes. The City may install or affix and maintain its own Facilities for City purposes in or upon any and all of Service Provider's Ducts, Conduits, or equipment in the Public Right(s)-of-Way and other public property, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties (but in no event greater than the best price charged by Service Provider to any other user), to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available. 
(d)  Common Users. 
(1)  The Public Right(s)-of-Way have a finite capacity for containing Facilities, yet municipalities are increasingly not allowed to exclude a new Service Provider from the market. Accordingly, there is a paramount public interest in maximizing the use of the capacity of the use of existing Public Right(s)-of-Way. Whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable to jointly trench or share bores or cuts, the Service Provider shall work with other, licensees, Service Providers, Contractors and franchisees so as to reduce as much as possible the number of Public Right(s)-of-Way cuts within the City. Whenever the City determines it is impractical to permit Construction of an underground Conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain Conduits or Ducts in the Public Right(s)-of-Way, but excluding entities providing services in competition with Service Provider and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or state law regulations, the City may require Service Provider to afford to such entity the right to use Service Provider's surplus Ducts or Conduits in common with Service Provider, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus Ducts or Conduits entered into by Service Provider and the other entity. When the Service Provider and entity are unable to agree on the terms and conditions for use, the City may require them to default to the following: share a rental rate equal to the portion of the costs based on the space to be encumbered at a rate of capital installation costs plus ten (10) percent amortized over a period of ten (10) years. Nothing herein shall require Service Provider to enter into an agreement with such entity if, in Service Provider's reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of the Service Provider's Facilities. 
(2)  Service Provider shall give a Common User (with a copy to the City Engineer) a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days notice of its need to occupy a Conduit and shall propose that the Common User take the first feasible action as follows: 
a.  Pay revised Conduit rent designed to recover the cost of retrofitting the Conduits or Ducts with space-saving technology sufficient to meet Service Provider's space needs; 
b.  Pay revised Conduit rent based on the cost of new Conduits or Ducts constructed to meet Service Provider's space need; 
c.  Vacate the needed Ducts or Conduits; or 
d.  Construct and maintain sufficient new Conduits or Ducts to meet Service Provider's space needs. 
(3)  When two (2) or more Common Users occupy a section of Conduit, the last user to occupy the Conduit shall be the first to vacate or construct new Conduit unless otherwise agreed to by Common Users. When Conduit rent is revised because of retrofitting, space-saving technology or Construction of new Conduit, all Common Users shall bear the increased cost. 
(4)  All Facilities shall meet all applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between Service Provider and the other Common User. Service Provider or Contractor may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the Common User for its costs. Each Common User shall pay for any fines, fees, damages or other costs the Common User's attachments incurs. 
(e)  Excavation Safety. On Construction projects in which Excavation exceeds a depth of four (4) feet, the Service Provider must have detailed plans and specifications for Excavation safety systems. The term Excavation includes trenches, structural or any Construction that has earthen Excavation subject to collapse. The Excavation safety plan shall be designed in conformance with state law and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and regulations. 
(f)  Erosion Control. The Service Provider shall be responsible for providing stormwater management and erosion control that complies with City, state and federal guidelines. 
(g)  Wireless Communication Facilities in the Rights-of-Way . For any entity that is governed by Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Permit Required. A permit is required for the installation, modification, or repair of a network node, node support pole, pole, or other wireless communication facility that will encroach upon or be located in, on, or within a right-of-way street, alley, or other right-of-way within the City. 
(2)  Design Manual. Pursuant to the terms outlined in Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code, the City Manager shall enforce any design manual adopted by the city and the terms and conditions of the design manual shall outline the terms and conditions of any permit issued hereunder and are binding upon any entity subject to this section. 
(3)  Construction. The terms and conditions of this section and any design manual adopted in accordance with Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code shall be read in conjunction with this Article of the Amarillo Code of Ordinances. In the event of any discrepancy or ambiguity between this Article, this Code of Ordinances, the Design Manual, or Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code, the later shall control. 
(4)  City Council may establish a fee for issuance of a permit under this Article and any such fee may be included in fee schedule adopted by the City Council. For any entity that is governed by Chapter 284 of the Texas Local Government Code, the fee shall be $500.00 per application covering up to five network nodes (as that term is defined in Tex. Loc. Gov't Chapter 284 as amended), two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each additional network node per application and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per application for each pole. All fees must be paid in full before any permit shall be issued by the City.

Sec. 4-6-207. - Joint planning and construction; coordination of excavations. 
(a)  Excavations in Public Right(s)-of-Way disrupt and interfere with the public use of the City Streets and Alleys and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among Service Providers making Excavations in Public Right(s)-of-Way and between these Service Providers and Contractors and the City. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of Excavations being made wherever feasible and will ensure the Excavations in Public Right(s)-of-Way are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the reconstruction of the Streets and Alleys by the City. 
(b)  Utility Coordination Meeting. 
(1)  The City will hold a utility coordination meeting a minimum of once per year. The purpose of the meeting is for the City to inform Service Providers of proposed and current capital improvement projects in the City and also for the Service Providers to inform each other and the City of current and future projects. Each Service Provider shall make reasonable efforts to attend and participate in the meetings of the City, in which the Service Provider will be made aware of Public Right(s)-of-Way issues that may impact its Facilities. 
(2)  Except in an Emergency the City will notify the Service Providers at least four (4) months before Construction will start on a major City project. Preliminary engineering plans will be available for inspection to the Service Providers at least two (2) months before the project is to start Construction. Final engineering plans will be made available to the Service Providers at least one (1) month before the project is to start Construction. 
(c)  Excavation Plan. In addition to participating in the Utility Coordination Meetings, every Service Provider owning, maintaining or installing Facilities in Public Right(s)-of-Way shall meet annually with the City Engineer, at the City Engineer's request, to discuss Service Provider's planned or reasonably anticipated Excavations to occur in the calendar year of the meeting and for the next two (2) calendar years. Between the annual meetings to discuss planned Excavation work, Service Provider shall inform the City Engineer of any substantial changes in the planned Excavation work discussed at the annual meeting.

In cases where the Federal Insurance Administration has not conducted a study, then the area defined in the Storm Water Management Master Plan by HDR Engineering, Inc. or the area defined by any approved engineering report, study, or plan as an area subject to Flooding. The more restrictive interpretation shall apply. In a playa lake and its watershed, the area encompassing the Base Flood shall constitute a Special Flood Hazard Area - see Area of Special Flood Hazard. 
    Start of Construction: Any construction work beyond initial site preparation. Includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start date means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alternation of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building or structure, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building or structure. 
    Structure: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above-ground, as well as a manufactured or mobile home.

    Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have "incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by local code enforcement officials and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alternation of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." For the purposes of floodplain management regulation, the market value of the structure shall be as shown on the appraisal records of the Potter-Randall Appraisal District (PRAD) or as certified by a real estate appraiser either before the reconstruction or repair is begun, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    Variance: A grant of relief from the requirements of the floodplain management regulations, except Section 4-8-5. 
    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the City's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 4-8-3. - Statement of Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public harm and private losses due to flood conditions in Special Flood Hazard Areas. It has been designed to regulate and restrict uses of land that cause increases in flood heights or velocities and to prevent the construction of barriers which will divert flood-waters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards. This chapter seeks to control the alteration of natural floodplains and their protective barriers, to regulate changes to stream channels, and development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage. 
    The provisions of this chapter are designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for flood control projects by ensuring that developments are in compliance with comprehensive plans of the City; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in Special Flood Hazard Areas; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone Areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are able to determine that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area. 
(b)  In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restricts or prohibits land uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requires that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Controls filling, grading, dredging and other development which might increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will divert floodwaters or which might increase flood hazards to other lands.

Cross reference- Manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks, Ch. 4-7. 
Sec. 4-8-11. - Areas of shallow flooding. 
    Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with Base Flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable or indeterminate and where velocity flow may be evident. Shallow flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or; 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvement of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or; 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the Base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the Base Flood Elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-12. - Floodways and floodway fringe of natural water courses. 
(a)  Typical relationships between the floodway and floodway fringe and their significance to Special Flood Hazard Area development are shown in Figure 1 Flood Schematic, Section 4-8-25. 
(b)  Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments of any kind are prohibited within a regulatory floodway, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City during the occurrence of the Base Flood discharge. When the above provision is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of the City's floodplain management regulations. 
(2)  Placement of any manufactured home within a floodway is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. Placement must comply with this chapter. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, the City may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in Base Flood Elevations, provided that the City first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(c)  As shown in Figure 1 Flood Schematic Section 4-8-25, floodway fringe may exist adjacent to a floodway. Floodway fringe is the portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area that may be developed by raising the ground level. Encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments are permitted within the Floodway Fringe providing that: 
(1)  In areas where the floodway is not delineated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map, encroachment will not increase the FEMA Base Flood elevation by more than one (1) foot collectively, where it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic 
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the cumulative effects of former, existing and anticipated development have all been accounted for in the potential increase in elevation. 
(2)  The Lowest Floor of any Development is constructed a minimum of two (2) feet above the adjacent FEMA Base Flood elevation as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps. 
(3)  When a Base Flood elevation is not shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map, the elevation must be determined by a registered professional engineer. The determination method and elevation must be approved by the City Engineer. 
(d)  The developer shall obtain a Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision-F from the Federal Emergency Management agency for development in the floodway fringe unless the City allows otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-13. - Floodplain Administrator Duties and playa lake pro rata fees. 
(a)  The Floodplain Administrator shall administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate sections of Title 44 CFR Chapter I Parts 59 - 78 (Emergency Management and Assistance - National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the City Engineer shall include the following: 
(1)  Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Review permit applications to ensure that the proposed building site project, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(3)  Review, approve or deny all applications for floodplain development permits required by the adoption of this chapter. 
(4)  Review permits for proposed developments to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local government agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334 regarding U.S. Army Corp of Engineer approval for discharge of dredged or fill material in any portion of the navigable waters of the United States) from which prior approval is required. 
(5)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards, make the necessary interpretation to resolve conflicts between the exact and mapped boundaries. Assist with determination of Special Flood Hazard Area boundaries. 
(6)  Notify adjacent communities, Potter County, Randall County and the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(7)  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained by the landowners. Flood-carrying or holding capacity shall not be diminished. 
(8)  Require the developer to provide Base Flood Elevation data if such information is not available in a technically documented report prepared under the supervision of the Engineering Department, or in an engineering study that evaluates the extent of all proposed changes to a Special Flood Hazard Area. Obtain, review and reasonably use any Base Flood Elevation data available from a Federal, State, local or other source to administer the provisions of the City's floodplain management regulations. 
(9)  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, require that no new construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the City's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the Base Flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City. 
(10)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, may approve certain developments in Zones A1-30, AE and AH on the City's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the Base Flood by more than one (1) foot, provided that the City first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
(b)  Effective June 4, 2010, pro rata fees for playa lake development shall no longer be collected by the City. Funds previously collected for pro rata playa lake fees prior to June 4, 2010 shall remain on deposit with the City until such time as the owner or owners of the area does one (1) of the following: 
(1)  Makes an excavation which will contain the Base Flood; 
(2)  Determines that the Base Flood area will be retained in its natural state and files legal instruments approved by the City which will prohibit future development in such area; 
(3)  Installs and provides for perpetual operation of a positive drainage method. 
    Such funds on deposit shall be disbursed on a pro rata basis to the owner or owners of the area at the time of compliance with paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) above. Interest from funds on deposit may be utilized by the City in solving drainage-related problems within the watershed from which the funds were collected. Any interest not utilized on drainage problems will remain in the designated fund and be disbursed on a pro rata basis in accordance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-14. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 7315, § 2, adopted Jan. 24, 2012, repealed § 4-8-14, which pertained to board of appraisal review and derived from Ord. No. 7217, § 2, adopted June 1, 2010. 
Sec. 4-8-15. - Variance. 
(a)  Applications for a variance shall be submitted in writing by the developer, subdivider or property owner to the City Engineer. The application shall state fully the grounds for the variance and all facts relied upon by the applicant. 
(b)  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the authority to grant a variance to the requirements of this chapter only when the following shall be found: 
(1)  No increase in the Base Flood Elevation will result if the variance is granted. 
(2)  No additional risk of flooding on the property will result if the variance is granted. 
(3)  The variance requested is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  The variance is issued upon (i) showing good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; (iii) a determination that granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  When the City Engineer has made the finding required in subsection (b) and has reduced the same in writing to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the requirements of this chapter may be varied for the following: 
(1)  Rehabilitation of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state or local inventory of historic places provided that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2-acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures equal to or above the Base Flood Elevation, provided the relevant factors of this chapter have been fully considered. As lot sizes increase above the 1/2-acre size, the potential for higher runoff and flooding increases, therefore, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases accordingly. 
(3)  The construction and use of storm cellars or fallout shelters in residential and nonresidential areas provided that the storm cellar or fallout shelter is not attached to any main structure and is not used for other than emergency occupancy; and provided further, that all electrical, heating and other mechanical equipment for storm cellars and fallout shelters shall be equal to or above the Base Flood Elevation. 
(4)  Substantial improvements where the lowest Floor elevation is between the Base Flood Elevation and one (1) foot above the elevation of the Base Flood. 
(d)  The City Engineer may make a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission to grant a variance for lowering the lowest floor elevation required by this chapter. All material necessary to elevate the building pad and its adjoining slopes shall be excavated from the area of the playa lake in accordance with Section 4-8-5. In no event shall such variance reduce the lowest floor elevation below the Base Flood Elevation adopted in the City's current floodplain management regulations, unless the City allows otherwise under an appeal in accordance with Section 4-8-16. Any such appeal sustained by the City Council could result in an amendment to this chapter and could cause a violation of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
    To grant a variance, the City Engineer shall first receive an executed contract between the lake owner and the applicant requesting the variance, which authorizes the applicant to remove material from the lake. A time schedule acceptable to the City Engineer for the removal of the material and its deposit on the building site or outside of any Special Flood Hazard Area must be provided. In a lake owned by the City, the City Engineer shall allow the applicant to remove the necessary material from the lake affected. Approved variances shall not alter other requirements of this chapter. 
    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the Base Flood Discharge would result. 
    For Playa Lake #6, Lawrence Lake, the applicant will not be required to remove material from the Special Flood Hazard Area. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010; Ord. No. 7658, § 2, 3-14-2017) 
Sec. 4-8-16. - Variance appeals. 
(a)  Any applicant, developer, subdivider or property owner who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning a variance request may appeal to the City Council within fifteen (15) days from the date of notification of the ruling, by filing a written request with the City Secretary that the application be heard and determined by the City Council. 
(b)  The City Engineer shall transmit to the City Council all the papers constituting the record for which the original variance was refused. 
(c)  The City Secretary shall thereupon fix a time for a hearing before the City Council and shall notify all interested persons of the hearing. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010; Ord. No. 7658, § 2, 3-14-2017) 
Sec. 4-8-17. - Written notice to applicants granted a Variance. 
    Any applicant granted a variance with the elevation of the lowest floor equal to or above the Base Flood Elevation shall be given written notice by the City Engineer that the structure shall be permitted to be constructed, that the area is subject to periods of flooding, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with any increased hazard resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such variance shall be filed in the deed records of the proper county by the City Engineer at the applicant's cost. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-18. - Record of Variances. 
    The City Engineer shall maintain records of all variances and shall report all variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-19. - Compliance with chapter. 
(a)  No structure or land shall be located or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(b)  All land located within Special Flood Hazard Areas shall remain under the requirements of this chapter regardless of what elevation changes are made within the Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
(c)  Prior to a building permit or any other permit being issued by the City for any land in the Special Flood Hazard Area of a playa lake, the lot or tract of land for which such permit is sought must comply with all the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-20. - Interpretation and application. 
    In the interpretation of this chapter all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted to the City by State statutes. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-21. - Disclaimer of Liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be further increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages, costs or claims that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-22. - Conflicts and Severability. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter as amended from time to time and another provision of this Code conflicts or overlaps, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
    If any section, clause, sentence or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-23. - Penalties and Violations. 
    This chapter is a public safety requirement. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter. A violation of this chapter shall constitute an offense punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense punishable in accordance with Section 1-1-5. 
(Ord. No. 7217, § 2, 6-1-2010) 
Sec. 4-8-24. - Findings of Fact. 
    The flood hazard areas of the City of Amarillo are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

The elevation of any point on the Primary Surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the Runway Centerline. 
The width of a Primary Surface for other than a utility Runway is one thousand (1,000) feet for Precision Instrument Runways and one thousand (1,000) feet for a Nonprecision Instrument Runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile. 
    Surface, Transitional: Surfaces extending outward at ninety-degree angles to the Runway Centerline and the Runway Centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the Primary and Approach Surfaces to where they intersect the Horizontal and Conical Surfaces. Transitional Surfaces for those portions of the Precision Approach Surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the Conical Surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the Approach Surface and at ninety-degree angles to the extended Runway Centerline. 
    Tree: Any object of natural growth. 
    Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The twenty-four-hour average sound level in decibels, for the period from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of ten (10) decibels to sound levels for the periods between midnight and 7:00 a.m. and between 10:00 p.m. and midnight (local time) as averaged over a span of one (1) year. A mathematical definition of Ldn can be found in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 150 on file in the planning department of the City.

Sec. 4-9-3. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  It is hereby found that Airport Hazards and Obstructions have the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of Amarillo International Airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an Obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of Amarillo International Airport; and that an Obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft. Accordingly, it is declared that: 
(1)  The establishment of an Obstruction has the potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by Amarillo International Airport; 
(2)  The encroachment of noise-sensitive or otherwise incompatible land uses within certain areas set forth hereinbelow may endanger the health, safety and welfare of the owners, occupants or users of the land; 
(3)  It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of Obstructions that are a Hazard to Air Navigation or potential incompatible land uses be prevented; 
(4)  The prevention of these Obstructions and land use conflicts should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation; 
(5)  The Amarillo International Airport fulfills an essential community purpose. 
(b)  It is further declared that the prevention of the establishment of Hazards to Air Navigation; the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of Hazards to Air Navigation; the marking and lighting of Obstructions; and the prevention of the establishment of incompatible land use on properties adjacent to the Airport are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

Sec. 4-9-71. - Zones. 
(a)  In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created and established certain Height Hazard Zones which include all of the land extending outward and upward from the primary surface and lying beneath the Approach Surface, Transition Surface, Horizontal Surface, and Conical Surface as defined on the Height Hazard Map dated June 25, 1990. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Primary zones. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of a runway. The width of the primary surface is one thousand (1,000) feet for nonprecision instrument runways having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways, the elevation of any point on a primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
(2)  Approach zones. 
a.  Runway 4 Left/22 Right and Runway 31 (Precision Instrument Runways): Approach zone is established beneath the Approach Surface at the ends of Runway 4 Left/22 Right and Runway 31 on Amarillo International Airport for precision instrument landings and takeoffs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet which coincides with the width of the Primary Surface at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the Runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet beyond each end of the Primary Surface, its Centerline being the continuation of the Centerline of the Runway. 
b.  Runway 13 and Runway 4 Right/22 Left (Nonprecision Instrument Runways): Approach zone is established beneath the Approach Surface at the ends of Runway 13 and Runway 4 Right/22 Left on Amarillo International Airport for nonprecision instrument landings and takeoffs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet which coincides with the width of the Primary Surface at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the Runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet beyond each end of the Primary Surface, its Centerline being the continuation of the Centerline of the Runway. 
(3)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath the Transitional Surface adjacent to each Runway and Approach Surface as indicated on the Height Hazard Map. Transition Surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of Runways, have variable widths as shown on the Height Hazard Map. Transitional Surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the Runway Centerline and the Runway Centerline extended at a slope of 7:1 from the sides of the Primary Surface and from the sides of the Approach Surfaces. Transitional Surfaces for those portions of the precision Approach Surface which project through and beyond the limits of the Conical Surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the Approach Surface and at right angles to the Runway Centerline. 
(4)  Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane which is one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established Airport Elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the Primary Surface of Runways 4, 22 and 31 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(5)  Conical zone. The area beneath the Conical Surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the Horizontal Surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
(b)  Three (3) official and identical copies of the Height Hazard Map dated June 25, 1990, and approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and reflecting the boundaries of the Height Hazard Zones are hereby adopted; the Mayor and the City Secretary are authorized to sign and attest each map as the Height Hazard Map for Amarillo International Airport.

Sec. 4-9-72. - Height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no Structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no Tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a Height in excess of the applicable Height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable Height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. 
a.  Runway 4 Left/22 Right and Runway 31 (Precision Instrument Runways): One (1) foot in Height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the Primary Surface and extending to a point ten thousand (10,000) feet from the end of the Primary Surface, then rising one (1) foot in Height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance for an additional forty thousand (40,000) feet from the end of the Primary Surface. 
b.  Runway 13 and Runway 4 Right/22 Left (Nonprecision Instrument Runways): One (1) foot in Height for each thirty-four (34) feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the Primary Surface and extending to a point ten thousand (10,000) feet from the end of the Primary Surface. 
(2)  Transition Zones. Slope seven (7) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the Primary Surface and the Approach Surface, and extending to a Height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the Airport Elevation. There are also established Height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the Approach Surface, and extending to where they intersect the Conical Surface. Where the Precision Instrument Runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established Height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the Approach Surface, and extending a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the extended Runway Centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. Establish at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the Airport Elevation, or a Height of three thousand seven hundred fifty-five (3,755) feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the Airport Elevation and extending to a Height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the Airport Elevation. 
(b)  In addition to the Height restrictions imposed by the imaginary surfaces, no Structure or natural growth shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in an Airport Hazard Area at such Height as would result in the increase of any minimum flight altitude, vectoring altitude, ceiling, minimum descent altitude or landing or takeoff visibility minimum for any category of aircraft as established by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any Tree or Structure to a Height up to seventy-five (75) feet above the surface of the land.

(2)  When any developed Lot, Parcel or Tract of land is reduced in size by a taking for public necessity and the reduction affects the Lot Area, Width, Depth, Building Setback or Off-Street Parking of the Lot to the extent that the use at the time of taking would be rendered a violation of this chapter. 
(b)  No Nonconforming Use may be expanded or increased beyond the Lot or Tract upon which such Nonconforming Use is located as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived except to provide off-street loading or Off-Street Parking space upon approval of the Building Official. 
(c)  Any Nonconforming Use may be changed to a Conforming Use, and once such change is made, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to a Nonconforming Use. 
(d)  A change of Occupancy from one (1) Nonconforming Use to a more restrictive Nonconforming Use may be made by securing a Specific Use Permit. 
(e)  Where a conforming use is located in a Structure not meeting the requirements of section 4-10-151 and Article V, Divisions 2, 3 and 4 of this chapter the use may be changed to another conforming use by securing a Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance. 
(f)  Whenever a Nonconforming Use is terminated, all nonconforming rights shall cease and the use of the Premises shall thereafter conform to the zoning requirements for the Premises. Any Nonconforming Use which discontinues and which remains unused as the use which made the Premises a Nonconforming Use for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months shall be terminated. 
(g)  If a Structure not meeting the requirements of section 4-10-151 and Article V, Divisions 2, 3 and 4 of this chapter is partially destroyed by fire, the elements or other cause and said destruction exceeds fifty (50) percent of its reasonable value, the Structure shall not be restored to its nonconforming state unless approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.

(h)  Outdoor storage uses. Nonconforming Uses involving outdoor storage of materials, equipment or merchandise of any type and required by this chapter to screen such outdoor storage shall provide such screening in all Zoning Districts where required not later than two (2) years from the date of annexation or rezoning that caused the use to be nonconforming. 
(i)  An Adult Business which is in operation on the effective date of an annexation which does not conform to the location and zoning requirements pertaining to an Adult Business shall be a Nonconforming Use which may continue for three (3) years from the effective date of annexation. Upon the expiration of three (3) years, all Nonconforming Use rights shall terminate, and the use shall be illegal and shall terminate. 
(1)  The Nonconforming Use, as defined herein, shall not be increased, enlarged or altered except to comply with the requirements of section 4-10-153. 
(2)  If two (2) or more Adult Businesses are rendered Nonconforming by the required separation in section 4-10-152 only, first in time is first in right. It shall be the burden of the Adult Business asserting a priority to prove its prior right. 
(3)  If the Owner of an Adult Business is unable to recoup its investment in such business prior to termination, it may request an extension of time by filing a request with the Planning Department ninety (90) days prior to the termination date. 
a.  The application for an extension shall contain all of the data the applicant wishes to be considered in determining whether or not an extension should be granted. 
b.  The City Council may consider the application for extension and may grant additional time not to exceed one (1) year if it finds that the applicant's need outweighs the public interest in termination. 
(j)  Any premises that already sells alcoholic beverages on the date of the first reading [January 20, 2004] of this section, and which does not comply with the zoning requirements of this section, may continue in operation as a nonconforming use until any of the following events occurs:

(4)  Special exceptions and Appeals regarding the application of Downtown Urban Design Standards adopted in Article IV, Division 3 to a particular parcel or site. 
(c)  The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such Variance of the Height, Yard, area and coverage regulations and required number of parking and loading spaces prescribed by this chapter, and of the Downtown Urban Design Standards such as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. 
(1)  In authorizing a Variance, the Board shall find and show in its minutes such facts and/or special conditions by which each of the following conditions has been satisfied: 
a.  (i) Special circumstances exist on the property on which the application is made relating to its size, area, topography, location or surrounding conditions that do not apply generally to the other property in the same area and the same Zoning District, or (ii) that a substantial proportion of the other properties in the same area and Zoning District are legally enjoying the conditions which the applicant is requesting.

c.  That the Variance, if granted, will be of no material detriment to the public safety or welfare or injury to the use, enjoyment or value of the property in the vicinity. 
(2)  In exercising such authority, the Board shall be mindful that a Variance shall not be granted where it will operate to relieve the applicant of a condition or circumstance: 
a.  Which is not inherent in the property itself, but rather is the result of the use or development of the property; 
b.  Which was caused by the division of land after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, which division of land caused the property to be unusable for any reasonable development under the existing regulations; 
c.  Which was otherwise self-imposed by the present or a previous owner; 
d.  Which is founded solely upon the opportunity to make the property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner. 
(d)  The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal the reduction or variation of landscaping requirements, as specified by this chapter, which would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. This subsection also authorizes the Board to grant reductions, waivers, or variations under the Downtown Urban Design Standards. 
(1)  In authorizing a Variance, the Board shall find and show in its minutes that the Variance would allow for the installation of alternative landscaping materials not otherwise contemplated by this chapter. 
(2)  In considering a Variance under this section, the Board shall consider Variances to minimum parking requirements, minimum Setback requirements, or maximum Lot Coverage requirements, or any combination of requirements of Article 4, Division 6 of this chapter. It shall be the policy of this section that the Board shall endeavor to make a particular site and project feasible by varying first the Parking, Setback, and Lot Coverage, then varying the landscaping requirements, except when considering property that is subject to the Downtown Urban Design Standards in which case those standards shall be applied or varied as deemed most appropriate in keeping with the intent of such design standards.

Sec. 4-10-166. - Compliance with division; applicability. 
(a)  Except as herein provided, no Structure or part thereof shall be erected, altered or converted for any use permitted in the District in which it is located unless it is in conformity with all the minimum regulations specified in this division for Lot Area, Lot Width, Lot Depth, Lot Coverage and Front, Side and Rear Yards. The area regulation shall not apply in the usual manner to individual Lots of Parcels in a PD District. 
(b)  Where lot area regulations present hardships regarding accessibility or physical barrier issues related to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Director of Community Services, or designee, shall determine the manner in which requirements of this Article are to be applied, in order to make a reasonable accommodation. 
(c)  In determining what is a reasonable accommodation, the Director of Community Services shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  Nature of the disability and whether the requested accommodation is directly responsive to the disability; 
(2)  Whether the requested accommodation poses a safety risk to the requestor or other persons; 
(3)  The relative costs of various alternatives, including modifying the Structure; 
(4)  The presence, if any, of existing Structures or variances in the neighborhood which are the same or similar to that sought under this section as an ADA accommodation; 
(5)  Availability of alternative accommodations that will have less visual or aesthetic impact on the neighborhood; 
(6)  Other accommodation factors suggested or mandated by ADA regulations or interpretative opinions thereof. 
(d)  If a question arises as to whether a person has a disability, the extent of disability, or the level of accommodation that is reasonable and necessary, then the Director of Community Services or designee shall first compare statements of the applicant's physician with current legal sources describing conditions that are recognized as a disability under the ADA. If there remains a question, then the Director of Community Services shall request the Disability/Accommodation Review Committee of the Amarillo Transit Department (or a successor or similar body associated with the City of Amarillo) to review the matter and make an advisory recommendation to the Director. The Director will then render a decision using the criteria stated above and taking into consideration the committee recommendation. The Applicant shall cooperate with the reviews described in this section by promptly providing all requested documentation and, by appearing before the Disability/Accommodation Committee, if requested. 
(e)  An Applicant who disagrees with the determination of the Director of Community Services may appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment by filing a written notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after the Director renders the decision. The appeal notice must state the specific grounds, reasons, or complaint. The notice must be filed with the Director, who shall transmit to the Board the notice and all papers constituting the record upon which the decision was made.

Sec. 4-10-226. - Purpose and applicability. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of a site plan is to ensure that a development project is in compliance with all applicable City ordinances and guidelines prior to commencement of construction. The site plan review and approval process is intended to promote, among other items, the efficient and harmonious use of land, safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking and loading, lighting, screening, and landscaping. 
(b)  Applicability. Approval of a site plan is required for the following: 
(1)  Prior to the development of any use or structure other than single-family detached (excluding Manufactured Home Parks), single-family attached, or duplex residential development within the City limits. 
(2)  A site plan approved as part of a Planned Development District or Specific Use Permit shall be considered a site plan approval. 
(c)  Exemptions. Accessory use which is considered incidental to an established development and which results in: 
(1)  No change in use, and 
(2)  No increase in traffic or is used only for storage and/or warehousing, 
(d)  Extent of Area To Be Included In a Site Plan. When the overall development project is to be developed in phases, the Site Plan area shall include only the portion of the overall property that is to be developed/constructed. However, any excluded area must be separately developable as a stand-alone site in the future. This provision shall not be interpreted to allow portions of a property to be excluded so as to avoid development standards, other requirements, or otherwise required improvements to the site. 
(e)  Submittal and Timing. A Site Plan shall be submitted prior to or in conjunction with a building permit application. No building permit shall be issued until a Site Plan, if required, and all other required engineering/construction plans are first approved by the City.

(2)  To supplement and aid the incorporated statutory provisions and definitions of state law, the following definitions are enacted to further inform and define such Penal Code offenses occurring within the City limits, when such is prosecuted pursuant to this article: 
a.  Water . Liquid water; reasonably free of algae blooms, dirt, and debris. 
b.  Shelter . Access to structure that is suitable for the species, age, condition, size, and type of each Animal; and, protects each Animal from rain, sleet, snow, hail, wind and direct sunlight; with no accumulation of excrement, wasted food, or other debris; and, for dogs and cats, provides a solid surface, resting platform, pad, floor mat, or similar device that is large enough for the Animal or Animals intended to occupy to be able to lie upon in a normal manner and can be maintained in a sanitary manner. 
c.  Food . Provision of such food as is appropriate in approximate quantity and type, suitable for the Animal's species, size, and age, as to sustain good health. 
(3)  Presumptions. For violations arising under this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that: 
a.  Food that is inaccessible to the Animal's mouth is neither adequate nor the necessary food as required by the incorporated statute or this article. 
b.  Water that is either frozen, exhibits unreasonable algae bloom or dirt, contained within a hole in the earth, or is located so as to be inaccessible to the Animal's mouth is neither adequate nor necessary water as required by the incorporated statute or this article. 
c.  Shelters with wire, grid, or slat floors that: (i) permit the Animal's feet to pass through the openings; or (ii) sag under the Animal's weight; or (iii) otherwise do not protect the Animal's feet or toes from injury, is neither adequate nor necessary shelter as required by the incorporated statute or this article.

(4)  Ear cropping and tail docking. 
a.  For purposes of this section: Ear cropping means the re-shaping of an Animal's ear by removing any part thereof by surgery or other means; and tail docking means the amputation of all or part of an Animal's tail by cutting, crushing, or other means. Subject to the stated exception, ear cropping and tail docking are each declared to be cruel and inhumane treatment of an Animal. 
b.  It is an offense: 
1.  For any person to perform ear cropping or tail docking, except as allowed in this subsection. 
2.  For an Animal Owner to perform or allow ear cropping or tail docking of his or her Animal, except by a person authorized in this subsection. 
c.  Exception: It is not an offense when ear cropping or tail docking are performed by a licensed veterinarian or one acting under the supervision of a veterinarian in a clinical setting. 
(b)  Unlawful restraint; tethering. 
(1)  Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 821, Subchapter D, "Unlawful Restraint of Dog," as amended, is hereby incorporated into this article. Where any provision of this article conflicts with this incorporated state law and cannot be harmonized, then state law shall prevail. 
(2)  To supplement and aid the incorporated statutory provisions and definitions, the following definitions and restrictions are enacted to further inform and define such offense occurring within the City limits, when such is prosecuted pursuant to this article: 
a.  Restraint. In addition to the requirements of incorporated statute, a rope, tether, cable or other similar device or material must have a swivel at each end and not unreasonably interfere with the dog's access to water, food and shelter. 
b.  Attachment. The restraint or tether shall be attached to the dog by a harness or properly fitted collar. However, in no event shall a restraint tether be attached to a dog by a choke collar, prong collar, or chain used as a collar. 
c.  Chain. Chain is not an acceptable material for purposes of a tether restraint and such is hereby prohibited. This prohibition does not apply to a handheld leash used while walking a dog. 
(3)  Negation of defense or excuse. Tethering is one available technique for confining an Animal to avoid it from being At-Large. The failure of any component of a tether system to restrain an Animal is not a defense to an Animal At-Large offense. Such a failure does not relieve or excuse an Owner from the legal duty to prevent an Animal from being At-Large. 
(c)  Investigation and prosecution. Upon discovering or being notified by any person that an Animal is or may be treated cruelly or inhumanely, or that a dog is unlawfully restrained or tethered, then an Animal Management & Welfare Officer or peace officer shall investigate such report. If probable cause is found for an allegation of cruelty to an Animal or unlawful restraint of a dog, then the Animal Management & Welfare Officer or peace officer may issue a citation for violation of this section for prosecution in municipal court, or refer the matter to the county or district attorney for prosecution, or seize the Animal pursuant to Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 821, or a combination of these.

(h)  Compliance visits; offense. 
(1)  For public safety and protection, Animal Control Officers and peace officers are authorized to make periodic unannounced visits (maximum of six (6) times per calendar year or more often upon probable cause) to the premises where the Dangerous Animal is kept, in order to verify the Owner's continuous compliance with the provisions of subsection (a). Animal Control Officers and peace officers are also authorized to obtain a search and seizure warrant for the Dangerous Animal if there is probable cause to believe that the Owner is failing or refusing to comply with any of the requirements of subsection (a). A Dangerous Animal seized under this subsection shall be impounded and maintained by the Department at the Owner's expense. The Department shall inform the prosecutors office and the court of the Dangerous Animal being in custody, whereupon the municipal court shall expeditiously set a hearing with notice to the owner, and conduct an inquiry into the animal's status and order a disposition of the Dangerous Animal. 
(2)  A person commits an offense if the person is the Owner of an animal previously deemed a Dangerous Animal per this Section and released to the Owner pursuant to the requirements of subsection (a), and thereafter the person fails or refuses to comply with the requirements of subsection (a). Upon conviction of an offense under this subsection, the court may order the Dangerous Animal to be seized (if it is not already in the custody of the Department) and humanely destroyed pursuant to applicable state law and Departmental euthanasia policy, or be returned to the Owner pursuant to the requirements of subsection(a). In addition the court shall assess against the Owner all costs and fees incurred by the Department for keeping, feeding, and caring for the Dangerous Animal.

CHAPTER 14-9. - CABLE TELEVISION 

Sec. 14-9-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to implement the authority to regulate Cable Television rates and services as authorized by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the "Act"), within the parameters promulgated in regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") and to administer FCC requirements. 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-2. - Compliance and administration. 
    The City will comply with and administer, to the fullest extent practicable, the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC as well as the FCC Regulations currently in effect and the rules set out in this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-3. - Rate regulation. 
(a)  Thirty (30) days following the adoption of this Chapter the Cable Television Franchise (the "Cable Operator") shall submit rate schedules and supporting data for its basic service rate schedule. The basic service tier is that tier which includes all broadcast signals, except those originating to satellites for transmission, delivered by television cable. 
(b)  Within thirty (30) days of receipt the City will: 
(1)  Issue a written order allowing additional time for analysis: 
a.  Not to exceed ninety (90) days if the rate schedules are based on benchmark rates, 
b.  Not to exceed one hundred and fifty (150) days if the rate schedules and supporting data are based on cost of service; 
(2)  Issue a written order allowing the proposed rates to take effect; or 
(3)  Issue a written order disallowing the proposed rate schedule. 
Failure on the part of the City to act within any required time will allow the proposed rates to go into effect by default. Should the City later determine that rates in effect by default are excessive, it may set proper rates and order refunds relating back one (1) year, but in no event earlier than September 1, 1993. 
(c)  Upon receipt of a proposed rate schedule the City may determine the proper level of rates to be charged and enter an order by ordinance setting such rates. 
(1)  If the proposed rate schedule is based on the benchmark formula and calculations, the City may not set rates lower than those prescribed by the FCC's benchmark rate tables or lower than ten (10) percent less than the cable operator's September 30, 1992 per channel rate, whichever is higher. 
(2)  If the proposed rate schedule is based on cost of service, the City may disregard the benchmark rates and the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates and prescribe rates it finds to be just and reasonable. 
(3)  Should the FCC lower the benchmark rates, the City may reduce the cable operator's rates on its own motion. 
(d)  Rates will not be set by the City without a public hearing which shall be called by resolution passed at least two (2) weeks prior to the public hearing. Notice of such public hearing will be published once one (1) week prior to the public hearing. Formal notice to the cable operator will be required prior to such hearing. Any interested person may participate in the public hearing. Should the cable operator fail to appear for such hearing, its rates may be set at a level the City finds reasonable. The burden of proof shall be on the cable operator to show that its rates conform to the Act and FCC Regulations. 
(e)  The City may hire such rate analysts and consultants as it requires to make recommendation to the City. The cable operator shall have a ministerial duty to provide the City's consultant with any information in whatever detail the consultant requires to make the required recommendation. The City shall adopt the report of such consultant before the consultant's recommendations can be relied on by the City. Upon adoption of the consultant's report and approval of the consultant's fees and charges, the cable operator shall reimburse the City for the reasonable expenses relating to the consultant's work. 
(f)  Rate making is a quasi judicial function of the City, and rates may not be enacted as a result of a settlement. 
(g)  Should the City determine that rates being charged by the cable operator are excessive it may order the cable operator to refund the excessive portion of such rates to subscribers. The cable operator shall maintain an accounting of customer billings for at least one (1) year at all times on which such refunds shall be based. The cable operator's liability for refunds shall be limited to one (1) year and shall not extend prior to September 1, 1993. Within sixty (60) days of a refund order the cable operator shall submit a refund recapitulation to the City detailing the refund calculation, the interest calculation and when the refund was made. Refunds shall be a ministerial duty of the cable operator. 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-4. - Equipment and customer charges. 
(a)  The cable operator may not impose charges for use of equipment by subscribers that exceed the reasonable costs of providing such equipment based on amortization of initial equipment purchases over a reasonable time. Amortization periods employed by the cable operator for Federal Income Tax purposes shall be presumed reasonable. The cable operator may recover a reasonable level of profit above the cost recovery. 
(b)  The cable operator may not impose charges for customer services which exceed the incremental costs of providing such services plus a reasonable level of profit on such costs. 
(1)  No charge will be imposed on a customer for changing levels of service based on the cable operator's re-tiering of service if such changes are requested by the customer within thirty (30) days of notice of re-tiering. 
(2)  The cable operator shall not implement or use a negative billing option which tells the customer, in effect, "we will provide you the following service unless you tell us you do not want the service." 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-5. - Confidentiality of information. 
    Should the cable operator assert or contend that any information submitted to the City or required by the City or its consultants is confidential and should be protected from disclosure under the Texas Open Records Act or the Freedom of Information Act, it shall be incumbent on the cable operator to submit to the City a legal brief supporting its assertion of confidentiality. The City will not rule on the confidentiality but will request a ruling from the appropriate decision-making authority using solely as justification the cable operator's brief. The City will be bound by the decision of the appropriate decision-making body. The cable operator may pursue whatever remedies from such decision it deems advisable. 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-6. - Customer service standards. 
(a)  FCC Regulations require specific standards for customer service by cable operators. The cable operator will file with the City Secretary its written procedures for compliance with FCC customer service standards. 
(b)  Should the City receive a customer service complaint it will transmit details of the complaint to the cable operator by telephone or facsimile transmission. The cable operator will give the city its response to the complaint within the time prescribed by the FCC Regulations for responding to the type of complaint. If the cable operator is unable to respond to the complaint within the prescribed time it will notify the City in writing of the reason for its inability and the expected time of response. 
(c)  Failure of the cable operator to respond to customer complaints as required may result in a complaint being filed with the FCC. 
(Ord. No. 6044, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 14-9-7. - Severability. 
    Should any word, clause, phrase, sentence or portion of this ordinance, or of the provisions adopted hereby be determined invalid due to conflict with or lack of enabling authority such portion shall be severable and shall be severed from these provisions and shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 16-3-353. - Purpose. 
    The efficiency and safety of a roadway facility without control of access depends to a large extent upon the amount and character of roadside interference, most of which originates in vehicle movements to and from businesses, residences, or other development along the roadway. Interference resulting from indiscriminate roadside development and uncontrolled driveway connections results in lowered capacity and increased hazard. Accordingly, regulation and overall control of driveway connections are necessary to provide efficient and safe operation of the roadway. 
(Ord. No. 6726, § 2, 5-19-2004) 
Sec. 16-3-354. - Authority and Adoption of Driveway and Parking Manual; Process; Publication; and Effective date.

(b)  Process. Upon both the initial adoption of and each subsequent amendment or supplement of the Driveway & Parking Manual, the following process shall be followed: 
(1)  The Traffic Commission shall conduct at least one (1) public hearing for the adoption of and each subsequent amendment or supplement, so that the Traffic Engineer may hear further comments and questions from the public, interested persons the Traffic Commission, and other City staff. At the public hearing the Traffic Engineer shall report to the Traffic Commission any comments received during the thirty-day comment period. The Traffic Engineer shall carefully consider each comment, weighing same against the engineer's professional knowledge, experience, and the goals of the manual and the proposed amendment or supplement. 
(2)  The Traffic Engineering Department shall publicize and receive comments upon every proposed amendment and supplement by the means described in subsection (c) below, for a period of not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the Traffic Commission conducts the public hearing.

A proposal or plan for a driveway or parking project submitted for review during the fifteen-day period shall be subject to the new manual or amendment or supplement thereto. However, an amendment or supplement shall not apply to or be effective as to any project or location that was already approved or issued a permit by the Traffic Engineering or Building Safety departments under a prior version of the Driveway & Parking Manual, provided that such prior approval or permit has not lapsed or expired. 
(4)  The manual shall not be amended or supplemented more often than once every twelve (12) months, from the date of the last amendment or supplement, unless such is required sooner in order to comply with changes in other laws or regulations. 
(c)  Publication. Upon proposing both the initial adoption of and each subsequent amendment or supplement of the Driveway & Parking Manual, the affected text, drawings, and tables shall be disseminated to the general public and interested persons by reasonable means, including but not limited to: posting on the City's internet website; mailing to parties who have enrolled on a mailing list with the Traffic Engineering Department; and, having a copy available for public review in the City offices of Traffic Engineering, Building Safety, and the City Secretary.

(1)  The traffic-control signal was faulty; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer or other person directing traffic at the request of a police officer, or was a participant in an authorized funeral procession or parade that had the right-of-way through the intersection in disregard of the red signal;

(4)  If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  The User shall report any significant changes in operations, or Wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(f)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the Director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change. 
(1)  The Director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 18-3-51(d) of this chapter. 
(2)  The Director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 18-3-30 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 18-3-51(a) of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(g)  Notice of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately contact and notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known) and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  Failure to notify the Director of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
(4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to contact in the event of a discharge described in subsection (1) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analyses and submit the results of the repeat analyses to the Director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The User is not required to resample if the Director monitors at the User's facility at least once a month, or if the Director samples between the User's initial sampling and when the User receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Analytical requirements. All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an industrial waste permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(j)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the City, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c), and (d) of this section. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite collection techniques unless the Director approves time proportional sampling. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory; total residual chlorine, pH, and temperature samples may not be composited under any circumstances. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in Sections 18-3-31(a) and (c) of this chapter [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 18-3-32(c) [40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)], the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the persons(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-32. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  Every User shall provide and operate at the User's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the Building Sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated on the User's Premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the User, allow the facility to be constructed in a public Street or Sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by Landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the User. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days following written notification by the City. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-33. - Inspection and sampling. 
(a)  Policy. The City may inspect the facilities of any User at least once per year to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Occupants of Premises where Wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the Premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling and records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The City, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA shall have the right to set up on the User's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring or metering operations or all. Where a User has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their Premises, the User shall make necessary arrangements with its security so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA will be permitted to enter the User's Premises, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(b)  Determining character, volume and concentration of waste. The Industrial Waste discharged or deposited into the Sanitary Sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the Director. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the Wastewater under operational conditions. The determination of the character and concentration of Industrial Waste shall be made by the Director at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the Director. Should a User discharging Industrial Waste into the Sanitary Sewers desire that a determination of the quality of such Industrial Waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the Director, such special determination may be made by the Director at the expense of the User discharging such Industrial Waste. 
    Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided for the proper handling of liquid Wastes containing Greases in excessive amounts, or any flammable Wastes, sand and other prohibited ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or Dwelling Units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Wastewater Treatment Director and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
    Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. 
    Sizing of such Grease and Oil interceptors shall be in accordance with the provisions of the City's plumbing code. 
    Where installed, all Grease, Oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the User at his expense in proper operating condition at all times. 
(c)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing Abnormal Sewage surcharges shall be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the Water Department. If a User discharging Waste into the city's Sanitary Sewer system produces evidence to the Director demonstrating that a substantial portion of the total amount of metered water does not reach the City's Sewer system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be established by the Director. 
    Any User who procures any part or all of his water supply from sources other than the City Water Department, all or part of which is discharged into the Sanitary Sewer, shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of the type approved by the Director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing Sewer service charges. Such meters shall be read monthly and tested for accuracy when deemed necessary by the Director. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director that a substantial portion of the water as measured by the aforesaid meter, or meters, does not enter the Sanitary Sewer system of the City, then the Director may require or permit the installation of additional meters at the User's expense in such manner as to measure the quantity of water actually entering the Sanitary Sewer system from the Lot, Parcel of land, Building or Premises of such User, and the quantity of water used to determine the Sewer service charge may be the quantity of water actually entering the Sewer system as so determined, if the Director so elects. 
    If the Director finds that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of Waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, he shall determine the quantity or quality, or both, of the Waste in any manner or method he may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the Sanitary Sewer system of the City and the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the Sewer service charge. 
(d)  Search Warrant. If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the Director may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-34. - Pretreatment. 
    Users shall provide necessary Wastewater Treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all Industrial Waste Permit Limits within the time limitations as specified by the Industrial Waste Permit. Any facilities required to Pretreat Wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the User's expense. Detailed plans showing the Pretreatment Facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of the article. Any subsequent changes in the Pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the User's initiation of the changes. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-35. - Confidential information; trade secrets. 
(a)  Information and data on a User obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the User specifically requests and is able to demonstrate pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods or production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the User. 
(b)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, and an opinion requested form the Attorney General of Texas. Nonetheless, such questioned information shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) Permit, or the Pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-36. - Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance. 
    The Director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the significant users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(a)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, by any amount; 
(b)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(c)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(d)  Any discharge of pollutants that have caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or have resulted in the City's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(e)  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(f)  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(g)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(h)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the Director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010; Ord. No. 7658, § 2, 3-14-2017) 
Sec. 18-3-37. - Administrative enforcement procedures; revocation of permit. 
    Enforcement procedures for violations of this article shall be as stated in the Approved Pretreatment Program, including but not limited to the following. The Director is specifically authorized, in consultation with the City Attorney, to prescribe such further procedural details, steps, and timelines for enforcement as may be deemed necessary or convenient to protect the public and City's legal interests, provided that such does not conflict with this article or established law. 
(a)  Immediate danger. When in the opinion of the Director a continuing or proposed discharge presents an immediate danger to the health or welfare of citizens or the environment, or an immediate danger to the Wastewater collection and Treatment system or any of its components, he shall immediately terminate the discharging person's Sewer and water service. The discharging person shall be notified as soon as possible of the termination of service and of the reason for the termination. After notice, the discharging person may appeal the decision of the Director to the City Manager, who may uphold, amend or overrule the Director' decision. Any person dissatisfied with the City Manager's decision may appeal to the City Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Secretary, within five (5) days of the City Manager's decision. The notice of appeal shall clearly state the precise grounds, the alleged point(s) of error made, and the relief sought. The City Council may uphold, amend or overrule the City Manager's decision after a hearing. In any hearing before the City Council under this section the substantial evidence rule shall govern determination of the matter. 
(b)  Substantial danger. The City may suspend the Wastewater Treatment service or an Industrial Waste Permit or both when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Director, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which endangers or might endanger the health or welfare of persons or the environment, or causes, or could cause, interference with the POTW, or causes, or could cause, the City to violate any condition of its TPDES permit. The determination of the Director may be appealed by the same procedures stated above for "Immediate danger." 
    Any person notified of a suspension of the Wastewater Treatment service, or the Industrial Waste Permit, or both shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as it deems necessary, including immediate severance of the Sewer connection and termination of the violator's water service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system, danger to any individuals, or violation of the City's TPDES Permit. The City shall, if possible, conduct an administrative hearing prior to the severance of a User's Sewer service. Such administrative hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as is prescribed for a show cause hearing in the case of a revocation of a permit; provided, however, three (3) days' notice shall be deemed sufficient notice to the violator of the administrative hearing if such notice is personally served by the City. The City shall reinstate the Industrial Waste Permit or the Wastewater Treatment service or both upon proof of the permanent elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the User describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. 
(c)  Revocation of permit. 
(1)  Policy. Any User who violates the conditions of this article, or applicable State and federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this section. The following are specific, but not inclusive, violations: 
a.  Failure of a User to factually report the Wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
b.  Failure of the User to report significant changes in operations, or Wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the User's Premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
d.  Violation of conditions of the permit. 
(2)  Notification of violation. Whenever the City finds that any User has violated or is violating this article, his Industrial Waste Permit, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the City shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time for satisfactory correction thereof. 
(3)  Consent Orders. In consultation with the City Attorney, the Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections d and e of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(4)  Show cause hearing. 
a.  The City shall order any User who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the Director, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Director, regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the User to show cause before the Director, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or member of a User which is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company or similar entity. 
b.  The Director, may conduct the hearing or designate an officer or employee of the City to: 
i.  Issue in the name of the Director, notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
ii.  Receive evidence and sworn testimony; 
iii.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Director, for action thereon. 
c.  After the Director, has reviewed the evidence, he may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the Sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate Treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
d.  Failure of a User to attend a show cause hearing or failure of a User to present evidence required by the person conducting the hearing shall be cause for immediate termination of sewer service. 
(5)  Compliance orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an Industrial Waste Permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified period of time. If the User does not come into compliance with the period of time specified, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(6)  Cease and desist orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an Industrial Waste Permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010; Ord. No. 7658, § 2, 3-14-2017) 
Sec. 18-3-38. - Judicial enforcement; penalties. 
(a)  Generally. If any person discharges Wastewater, Industrial Wastes or other Wastes into the City's Wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article, or applicable federal or state requirements, or any order of the City, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition to the penalties provided below, the City may recover actual costs, including but not limited to, repairs, fines and penalties, reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, other expenses of litigation, and interest against the person found to have violated this article or the applicable orders, rules, regulations and permits. In consultation with the City Attorney, the Director may employ any other remedies authorized by State or Federal administrative agency regulations. 
(b)  Injunctive relief. When the Director finds that a User has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an Industrial Waste Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may, through the City Attorney's office, request a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a restraining order, temporary, or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial waste permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the User. The Director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action, remedy or enforcement of any nature against a User. 
(c)  Civil Penalties. Any User who is found to have violated an order of the Director or who has willfully, knowingly or recklessly failed to comply with any provision of this article or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be penalized no less than an amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) nor more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each violation for each day that it exists. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. 
(d)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A User who has willfully or with criminal negligence violated any provision of this article, an industrial waste permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation, per day. 
(2)  A User who has willfully or with criminal negligence introduced any substance into the POTW which cause personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per day of offending discharge. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available to any person or entity under state law. 
(3)  A User who knowingly makes any materially false, misleading, or incomplete statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, industrial waste permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation, per day. 
(d)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false misleading, or materially incomplete statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or Industrial Waste Permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, be referred to the district attorney or other appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the state law. 
(e)  Corporate responsibility. A director, officer, employee, member or other person authorized to act in behalf of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association or other entity having responsibility for the discharge of a duty to act imposed by law on a corporation or association is criminally responsible for a violation under this chapter to the same extent as if such individual were personally a permittee under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 7222, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 18-3-39. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  A user shall have an affirmative defense to any type of enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference, and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when the POTW was in regularly in compliance with its TPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(b)  Act of God. If a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a statute within the City's jurisdiction or a rule adopted or an order or a permit issued under such a statute was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of that statute, rule, order, or permit. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays. 
(2)  A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of Subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  Bypass Notifications. 
a.  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A User shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days from the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Provided, however: 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life. personal injury, or severe property damage; 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
iii.  The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
b.  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (4) of this section.
