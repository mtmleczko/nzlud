PREFACE 
    This book constitutes a republication of the City Code of Kennewick, Washington. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of this republication were the City Code of Kennewick, Washington, as updated through August 2017, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the county. Any ordinances adopted after said date supersede the provisions of the City Code to the extent that they are in conflict or inconsistent therewith. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The City Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 18.12.050 is Section .050, located in Chapter .12 of Title 18. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the City Code. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Mary Summers, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Terri Wright, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a publication which will make the ordinances of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Such amount may be used to provide restitution to the victim at the order of the court. In such case the court shall make a finding as to the amount of the defendant's gain or victim's loss from the crime, and if the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support such finding, the court may conduct a hearing upon the issue. For purposes of this Section, the terms "gain" or "loss" refer to the amount of money or the value of property or services gained or lost. 
(Ord. 3370 Sec. 1, 1992) 
1.12.060: - Disposition by Agreement. 
    The City and a defendant may agree to the disposition of any case and such agreement may include, but need not be limited to, payment of costs of prosecution, continuance of the case for a period not to exceed two years, payment of restitution, payment of money to or for any specific purpose, dismissal of the case or its prosecution upon specific conditions or any other condition or term appropriate under the circumstances. If the court finds the agreed disposition to be fair and reasonable, it may enter the same upon the record and such agreement shall have the force and effect of any other judgment or order entered by the court. 
(Ord. 3370 Sec. 2, 1992) 
1.12.070: - Penalties Differing from State Law.

1.12.080: - Civil Penalties for Vandalism or Maintaining a Public Nuisance.

Violation of any of the above-mentioned provisions necessarily includes a violation of this Section, which need not be separately charged. 
(Ord. 3516 Sec. 1, 1994) 
CHAPTER 1.20 - RIGHT OF ENTRY FOR INSPECTION 

1.20.010: - Right of Entry for Inspection. 
    Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any provision of this Code, or whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that there exists a violation of this Code in any building or upon any premises within the jurisdiction of the City, any authorized official of the City may, upon presentation of proper credentials, enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon him by this Code; provided that, except in emergency situations, he shall first give the owner and/or occupant, if they can be located after reasonable effort, 72 hours' written notice of the authorized official's intention to inspect.

(1)  Whenever it is necessary to enter upon private property or the public property of another governmental agency to carry out the lawful directions of any ordinance, rule or statute or to carry out the lawful order, ruling or holding of any governmental office or agency, the City or any governmental agency may apply for a warrant authorizing the entry upon such property to carry out the same, if permission to enter has been refused by the owner, or if the owner cannot be found or reasonably ascertained. 
(2)  The application for a warrant shall be supported by an affidavit or the testimony of the officer intending to enter upon the property stating his office, purpose, and authority to so enter, the owner's refusal to permit such entry or the owner's unavailability, the work, action or other activity to be conducted upon the property and by whom and approximate time that the activity will be conducted. 
(3)  If the Court finds just cause for the issuance of the warrant, it shall subscribe the same with a return date of not more than ten days following completion of the action or activity to be conducted upon the property. 
(4)  Nothing in this section is intended to limit, restrict or otherwise affect the right of officers or agents of any governmental entity to enter upon private or public property for any lawful purpose.

(Ord. 5275 Sec. 1, 2009; Ord. 5270 Sec. 1, 2009; Ord. 3495 Sec. 1, 1993; Ord. 3313 Sec. 1, 1991; Ord. 3149 Sec. 1 (part), 1988) 
1.32.020: - Report from Department.

(Ord. 5270 Sec. 2, 2009; Ord. 3149 Sec. 1 (part), 1988) 
1.32.030: - No Action to be Commenced. 
    No action shall be maintained against the City for any claim for damages until the same has been presented to the City by filing the same with the City Clerk and 60 calendar days have elapsed after such presentation.

(Ord. 5270 Sec. 3, 2009; Ord. 3149 Sec. 1 (part), 1988) 
1.32.040: - Payment of Judgments-Warrants. 
    The Treasurer may draw warrants against the Risk Management Fund for the full amount of any judgment, including interest and costs against the City on account of personal injuries suffered by any person as shown by a transcript of judgment duly filed with him or the clerk.

1.32.050: - Tax Levy for Fund. 
    The City Council, after the drawing of warrants against the Risk Management Fund, shall estimate the amount necessary to pay warrants with accrued interest thereon and may appropriate and transfer money from any contingency fund sufficient therefor, or if there is not sufficient money in the contingency fund, may levy a tax sufficient to pay all or such unpaid portion of any judgment not exceeding $0.75 per thousand dollars of assessed value. If a single levy of $0.75 per thousand dollars of assessed value is not sufficient, and if other monies are not available therefor, an annual levy of $0.75 per thousand dollars of assessed value shall be made until the warrants and interest are fully paid. 
(Ord. 3149 Sec. 1 (part), 1988)

(Ord. 3149 Sec. 1 (part), 1988) 
CHAPTER 1.40 - REQUESTS FOR ACCESS TO OR COPIES OF CITY RECORDS 

1.40.010: - Policy. 
(1)  The City of Kennewick is committed to transparency in government. We will provide our customers the fullest assistance possible when requesting access to public records. 
(2)  The City is required by RCW 42.56 to adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations consistent with the intent of the Public Records Act: to provide access to public records, to protect public records from damage or disorganization, and to prevent interference with other essential City business. 
(3)  The City of Kennewick makes all public records available except those that are exempt by state or federal statute. 
(4)  Any person wishing to inspect or copy identifiable public records of the City should make the request in writing in one of the following ways: 
(a)  The primary and preferred request method is via the City's online Public Records Request Center. This method is more efficient to administer, maximizes taxpayer resources, and provides a cheaper and more prompt delivery of responsive records to the customer. 
(b)  By letter, fax, or email (see KMC 1.40.030 for the proper email address) addressed to the Public Records Officer. Individual email accounts are not to be used for submitting public records requests. Requests submitted to individual e-mail accounts are not permitted as they are not a reliable method to ensure receipt of a request. 
(5)  The following information should be included in the request: 
(a)  Name and address of requestor (optional but encouraged). Please note that anonymous requestors may not have access to records which include sensitive information such as social security numbers, identification numbers, addresses of public safety employees, lists of individuals, etc.); 
(b)  Contact information, including telephone number and email address (when applicable); 
(c)  Identification of the requested records adequate for the Public Records Officer to locate the records; and 
(d)  The date of the request. 
(6)  Oral Requests. The Public Records Officer may accept requests for public records that contain the above information by telephone or in person. If an oral request is made, the Public Records Officer will confirm receipt of the information and the substance of the request in writing. The requestor shall immediately notify the Public Records Officer if the City's interpretation of the oral request is incorrect and shall provide clarification. Oral requests to individuals other than the Public Records Officer are not permissible and will not be considered properly delivered to the City of Kennewick. 
(7)  Reasonable Notice That a Request is for Public Records. A requestor must give the City reasonable notice that the request is being made pursuant to the Public Records Act and that request should not be buried within another document. In most cases, a request made using the terms "public records," "public disclosure," "Public Records Act," or "Freedom of Information Act" provides reasonable notice. (WAC 44-14-04002(1)). All requests must be submitted pursuant to this policy and are not considered "received" under any other manner of submission. 
(8)  Existing, Identifiable Records. A requestor must request an "existing, identifiable record" or "class of records" before the City must respond to it. An "identifiable record" is one that City staff can reasonably locate. Requestors are not allowed to search through City files for records which cannot be reasonably identified or described to the City. However, a requestor is not required to identify the exact record he or she seeks. Other information sought from the requestor will be used to determine whether exemptions apply to the request. (WAC 44-14-04002(2)). 
(a)  In general, an "identifiable record" is not a request for "information." For example, asking "what policies the City has for handling discrimination complaints" is merely a request for "information." A request to inspect or copy the City's policies and procedures for handling discrimination complaints would be a request for an "identifiable record." Zoning Inquiries are not requests for public record and are subject to the City's Land Use Permit Fee Schedule. 
(b)  Public records requests are not interrogatories. The City is not required to conduct research for a requestor. A request for "any law that allows the City to impose taxes on me" is not a request for an identifiable record. Conversely, a request for "all records discussing the passage of this year's tax increase on real property" is a request for an "identifiable record." 
(c)  Requests are subject to the records which existed as of the date the request was submitted. Requests will not apply to records which come into existence at any time after the request is made including those which may come into existence while the request is open. 
(9)  No Obligation to Create Records. The City is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request. However, the City may, at its discretion create a new record to fulfill the request where it may be easier for the City rather than to collect and make available voluminous records that contain small pieces of information responsive to the request. However, the requestor must agree in writing that the new records will satisfy the request. 
(10)  No Duty to Supplement Responses. If a public record is created or comes into the possession of the City after a request is received by the City, it is not responsive to the request and will not be provided. A new request must be made to obtain later created public records. 
(11)  Counter Documents. Documents retained by the City that are readily available and can be provided without substantial research may be released without filing a written public record request form. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.020: - Index of Records. 
    The City finds that creating and maintaining a central city index of records is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations. The City Clerk's office shall maintain and make available to the public indices of ordinances, resolutions, and policies adopted by the city council, minutes of regular meetings of the city council and amendments, revisions, and repeals thereof and all public contracts, deeds and leases. These and all other indices maintained for City use will be made available for review by the public upon request to the Public Records Officer, unless exempted by state law. 
(Res. 04-15; Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.030: - Agency Description-Contact Information-Public Records Officer. 
(1)  Any person wishing to request access to public records of the City, or seeking assistance in making such a request, shall contact the City's Public Records Officer. 
(2)  The Public Records Officer will oversee compliance with the Act but may designate other City staff members who may process requests for public records. For Police records, the Public Records Officer has designated the Public Records Specialist. 
(3)  The Public Records Officer or designee(s) will provide the fullest assistance to requestors; ensure that public records are protected from damage or disorganization; and prevent fulfilling public records requests from causing excessive interference with essential functions of the City. 
(4)  When using these Rules, references to the Public Records Officer should be interpreted to also include his/her designees. 
(5)  Requests for records other than Police records. Requests to inspect or copy any records maintained by the City, other than Police records, should be made to the Public Records Officer at: 
City of Kennewick 
Public Records Officer - City Clerk's Office 
Public Records Request Center - (as the primary and preferred method) 
210 West 6 th Avenue 
P.O. Box 6108 
Kennewick, WA 99336 
Telephone: (509) 585-4578 
Fax: (509) 585-4445 
Email: PRRequest@ci.kennewick.wa.us 
(6)  Requests for Police Records. Requests to inspect or copy records maintained by the City's Police Department shall be made to the Public Records Specialist at: 
Kennewick Police Department 
Public Records Request Center - (as the primary and preferred method) 
211 West 6 th Avenue 
P.O. Box 6108 
Kennewick, WA 99336 
Telephone: (509) 585-4208 
Fax: (509) 582-9528 
Email: PolicePDR@ci.kennewick.wa.us 
(7)  Internet access to records. Many records are also available on the City of Kennewick website. Requestors are encouraged to preserve taxpayer resources by viewing documents available on the website prior to submitting a public records request. In accordance with RCW 42.56.520(2) the City may satisfy its obligation by providing an internet address and link on the agency's web site to the specific records requested. 
(8)  A computer kiosk is located in the lobby of City Hall and provides customers with direct access to the Public Records Request Center. City staff members are available to assist customers with this service. 
(9)  The "City" does not include the Kennewick Public Facilities District, the Kennewick Housing Authority, or any other independent body. Requests of those agencies will not be coordinated via the City of Kennewick's Public Records Officer and shall be made directly to those agencies by the requestor. 
( Ord. 5805, Sec. 1, 2019 ; Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.040: - Certain Personal and Other Records Exempt. 
(1)  The City is subject to the exemptions contained in RCW 42.56 and all other federal/state statutes including those that may be later amended and adopted. An exemption from disclosure will be narrowly construed in favor of disclosure (RCW 42.56.030). An exemption from disclosure must specifically exempt a record or portion of a record from disclosure. 
(2)  No provision of this policy shall be construed to require dissemination of any confidential communication from the City Attorney or any department head that is not subject to the disclosure requirements of RCW 42.56 or any communication that may lawfully be transmitted in an executive session pursuant to the State Open Public Meetings Act. 
(3)  The Code Reviser's Office annually provides the State Sunshine Committee with a list of public disclosure exemptions contained in the Revised Code of Washington. This list (as may be later amended) is incorporated into this Policy. However, the City's failure to list an exemption shall not affect the efficacy of any exemption. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.050: - Other Exemptions. 
(1)  Nothing in this policy shall be construed as authorizing the copying of any other document exempt by federal or state law. Police records are subject to RCW 10.97, RCW 42.56, RCW 13.50, RCW 68.50, and RCW 70.48. 
(2)  The City is prohibited by statute from disclosing lists of individuals for commercial purposes. (RCW 42.56.070(9). The Public Records Officer will investigate any requests for individuals (according to industry standards and best practices) to determine whether or not they are being sought for commercial purposes. If it is determined the lists are for commercial purposes the request will be denied. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.060: - Procedures for Exemptions and Redactions. 
(1)  The City reserves the right to redact identifying details when disclosing the public record if there is reason to believe that disclosure of such details would be an invasion of personal privacy or involves exempt material as noted above in 1.40.040. When exempt portions of Public Records can be redacted, the remainder thereof shall be open to public inspection and copying. 
(2)  Exemption Log. If the City determines that a record is subject to an exemption and is withholding the record in its entirety, the City shall prepare an exemption log that contains the following information: 
(a)  A description of the exemption including the statutory reference; 
(b)  The type of record being withheld; 
(c)  A short explanation of how the exemption applies to the record (or part) being withheld; 
(d)  The date the record was created; 
(e)  The number of pages; 
(f)  The author and recipient, or if otherwise protected, other means of sufficiently identifying particular records without disclosing protected contents; and 
(g)  Where the use of any identifying features would reveal protected contents, the City may designate the record with a numbered sequence. 
(3)  Notice of Redaction/Redaction Log. If the City determines that part of a record is subject to an exemption, the City shall redact the exempt portion(s), provide the non-exempt portions and note the redaction(s) in correspondence to the requestor or by creating a Redaction Log for numerous exemptions. The following information shall be included in writing: 
(a)  Page number where the exemption occurs; 
(b)  A description of the exemption including the statutory reference; and 
(c)  A short explanation of how the exemption applies to the record (or part) being withheld. 
(4)  Exemption and Redaction Logs for non-routine requests are to be reviewed by the City Attorney's Office prior to being provided to the requestor. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.070: - Retention and Destruction of Public Records. 
(1)  The Washington State Archivist has developed retention schedules for local government records including e-mail and electronic records. Records of the City should be retained and destroyed consistent with the retention schedules. If a public records request is made at a time when a record exists, but is scheduled for destruction in the near future, the person with possession and control of the record shall retain the record until the request is resolved. 
(2)  Backup copies of public records performed by information services personnel are not a substitute for records retention. Retention is the responsibility of the sender of the record, not the backup process. Backups are for disaster recovery only and files are not individually indexed/identifiable. To avoid interference with essential government operations, and to preserve organization of government records, backup tapes will not be examined in response to a public records request. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.080: - Medical Records, Information Access, and Disclosure. 
    Medical records shall be released or disclosed under a patient's written authorization, or in compliance with RCW 70.02.020. Therefore, requests for medical records shall be made to the Ambulance Billing Department by fax at 509-585-4254 and not through this public records policy. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.090: - Costs of Providing Copies of Public Records. 
(1)  There is no fee for inspecting public records. 
(2)  The City does not charge a fee for locating records. 
(3)  There is a cost to receive copies of records as described in the City's fee schedule which is adopted by Council resolution. 
(a)  The fee schedule for City Hall and Fire Department records is available at City Hall and on the City's website. 
(b)  The fee schedule for Police records is available at the Police Department and on the City's website. 
(4)  For security reasons and to avoid unreasonable disruption of operations, the City cannot offer copying facilities for public use or open files beyond business hours. 
(5)  Before beginning to make copies, the Public Records Officer or designee may require a deposit of up to ten percent of the estimated costs of copying all the records selected by the requestor. The Public Records Officer, or designee, may also require the payment of the remainder of the copying costs before providing all the records, or the payment of the costs of copying an installment before providing the installment. The City will not charge sales tax when it makes copies of public records. 
(6)  Cost of Mailing. The City may also charge the actual costs of mailing, including the cost of the shipping container. 
(7)  Fees are normally waived for government agencies or when supplying the copy would be in the City's interest. 
(8)  Customized Access is a matter of law as noted in RCW 42.56.120. The City may assess a customized service charge for exceptionally large records requests that require staff and resources beyond what is normally available to the agency. The fee is in addition to the authorized copying costs, and may include reimbursement for the actual costs of providing the records. A customized service charge is warranted if: 
(a)  Fulfilling the request requires extensive use of information technology resources to identify, locate, format, or translate a record, or provide electronic access services; or 
(b)  The request requires specialized analytical, research, or supervisory assistance to identify, locate, compile, or transfer the records. 
(9)  This policy does not apply to records sought under the rules of discovery in the course of litigation. If a requestor is seeking records under discovery, they need to make their request to the City Attorney's Office and not through this policy. All records requests made under this policy, regardless of intended use are subject to RCW 42.56 (including the exemptions allowed under the Act). 
(10)  GIS Information is available pursuant to KMC 1.40.100. 
(11)  Requests for Replacement Jobsite Plans: 
(a)  The City maintains (for a period of 90 days following project completion) a set of submitted plans in their original format. The City does not retain a stamped set of plans. Therefore, customers are responsible for protecting their stamped originals from loss, damage and destruction and for maintaining a copy of the stamped plans at the jobsite at all times. 
(b)  To obtain a replacement set of stamped jobsite plans, please submit your request and payment to the customer service permit desk (subject to current fee schedule) and not through this policy. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.100: - Geographic Information System Policy. 
(1)  GIS information is available to the general public on the City's website. 
(2)  When a request is made for the creation of custom electronic GIS information (files), the requestor will be asked to submit their request via the Public Records Request Center and upload a fully-executed "Request for Information Disclaimer" form in order to provide a time and cost estimate to complete the request. In this form, the requestor will be asked to provide details for the specific files/layers desired, the coverage/area required, and delivery method for electronic files. The requestor will be asked to approve the cost estimate (and provide a down payment of ten percent when requested) before the work will be scheduled. Upon completion of the project, the requestor will be notified and arrangements will be made for invoicing, payment, and delivery of the information requested. 
(3)  Fees for GIS services are based on the actual staff time required to create the data files plus any applicable printing fees and apply to all outside entities not covered by the GIS Data Sharing Agreement or doing work for the City. The current fee schedule for printed maps is available on the City's website. 
(4)  The current data sharing agreements with local governmental agencies will continue to define information release policies among these groups. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.110: - Prompt Responses Required. 
(1)  Within five business days of receiving a valid/proper public records request, the Public Records Officer must respond to the requestor in (one or more of) the following ways: 
(a)  Providing the record; 
(b)  Providing an internet address and link on the City's website to the specific records requested, except that if the requester notifies the City that he or she cannot access the records through the internet, then the City will provide copies of the record; 
(c)  Acknowledging that the City has received the request and providing a reasonable estimate of the time required to respond to the request; 
(d)  Requesting clarification from the requestor; or 
(e)  Denying the public records request. 
(2)  Additional time required to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request, collaborate with the requestor to ensure a successful search, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request and to prepare redaction logs as appropriate. 
(3)  As a courtesy, rather than denying an invalid request outright, the Public Records Officer may provide the requestor an opportunity to rephrase a request that does not sufficiently describe an identifying document. This courtesy is extended based upon availability of staff time and resources. If, within 30 days, the requestor fails to properly rephrase the request so that they have described an existing, identifiable document(s), the City need not respond to it. The request will not be considered "received" until it sufficiently requests and describes "existing, identifiable" records. The five-day deadline will begin on the date the request was properly submitted. 
(4)  Denials of requests must be accompanied by a written statement of the specific reasons therefor in accordance with RCW 42.56. 
(5)  Should a requestor not receive a timely response to their request as described above, the requestor shall be responsible for contacting the agency to confirm receipt of the request and that it complied with the requirements of RCW 42.56 and this policy. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.120: - Administrative Review of Actions by the Public Records Officer. 
(1)  Any person who objects to the denial of a request for a public record or the closure of a public records request shall petition for prompt review of such action by tendering a written request for review to the City Attorney. The written request shall specifically refer to the written statement by the Public Records Officer or other staff member which constituted or accompanied the action taken. 
(2)  Immediately after receiving a written request for review of a decision of the Public Records Officer, the City Attorney (or designee) shall request a response from the Public Records Officer or other person who responded to the request. The City Attorney (or designee) will immediately consider the matter and either affirm or reverse such action within two business days following the receipt of the written request for review of the action. 
(3)  Administrative remedies shall not be considered exhausted until the City Attorney (or designee) has made a written decision, or until the close of the second business day following receipt of the written request for review of the action of the Public Records Officer, whichever occurs first. 
(4)  No lawsuit to review the action taken, compel the production of a public record, or impose a penalty or attorney fees shall be brought before the administrative remedies set out in this section have been exhausted by the party seeking the record. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.130: - Managing Multiple, Frequent Requests from an Individual. 
    In order to provide the fullest assistance to all requesters; to prevent damage to or disorganization of City records or excessive interference with other essential City functions; or to assure that the appropriate amount of City time and resources will be fairly allocated among all requests and requesters, the Public Records Officer has the discretion to administer multiple, frequent open requests from an individual by either: 
(1)  Considering each request individually; or 
(2)  Administering requests sequentially. The Public Records Officer shall administer each request by the same requestor one at a time in consecutive order. 
(a)  The earliest request submitted will be the earliest request resolved. Work will begin on the next request once the earlier request has been resolved. Work will continue in this manner until all requests have been resolved. 
(b)  A requestor shall be permitted no more than two opportunities within a 12-month period to reorder their requests to the priority of their choosing; these requests for reprioritization shall be honored whenever practical to do so. 
(c)  Requestors are cautioned that work will not continue on subsequent requests until they have provided a timely response to requests for inspection, retrieval or payment or until the request is abandoned, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.140: - Protecting Rights of Others. 
    In the event that the requested records contain information that may affect rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure, the Public Records Officer or designee may, prior to providing the records, give notice to such others whose rights may be affected by the disclosure. The Public Records Officer or designee shall give sufficient notice to other persons so that the affected person can review the request, and if necessary, seek an order from a court to prevent or limit the disclosure. The notice to the affected persons will include a copy of the request. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.150: - Copyrighted Material-Commercial Purposes. 
(1)  Certain documents that are in the hands of the City may be protected by a statutory or common-law copyright. If the department believes that copying may violate fair use of the document, the owner will be promptly notified that he must seek prompt relief if he wishes to protect the document from copying. 
(2)  Copying of copyrighted material, other than fair use, will be refused if the department finds that copying will be for commercial purposes and fair value has not been paid to the copyright holder. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.160: - Providing Records in Installments. 
    When the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee, will provide access for inspection and copying in installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records in that way. If, within 30 days, the requestor fails to inspect (or provide payment for) the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017) 
1.40.170: - Closing the Request. 
(1)  The Public Records Officer shall provide requestors 30 days to respond to requests from the City to retrieve/review documents and/or provide payment (reproduction expenses or deposits). This notice shall be made in writing and shall include the deadline to respond. The notice shall also provide language alerting the requestor that their request will be automatically closed at the end of the deadline if they do not adequately respond. Should the 30 days lapse without the appropriate action of the requestor, the request will be listed as abandoned and closed. No further work will take place on the request. 
(2)  The Public Records Officer shall notify requestors that the City of Kennewick is not required to retain records longer than the minimum length of time prescribed by law. In order to not artificially extend the retention period of records and/or cause disorganization of the City's records, copies of records compiled for abandoned requests will not be retained. Therefore, records compiled for abandoned requests may not be available for later submittals. 
(3)  Requestors are urged to take timely action to prevent their requests from lapsing into an abandoned status. 
(Ord. 5708 Sec. 1 (part), 2017)

The pamphlet will contain information on how a person may register to vote and how he may obtain an absentee ballot. 
    The pamphlet will contain the text of each measure to be submitted accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared by the attorney for the jurisdiction submitting the measure and reviewed by the City Attorney and arguments for and against each proposition. Under normal circumstances candidate's statements and photographs will not be included within the pamphlet unless the Clerk determines that local newspapers will not carry candidate's statements or other than political advertising by them.

He will mail a copy of the notice to persons known to be for or against the proposition and will promptly notify the City Council of committee volunteers. 
    As soon as practical after the publication and mailing of notice, the City Council will appoint a person or committee not exceeding three to prepare statements for or against each proposition. If no person can be found to prepare such a statement, then the pamphlet will so indicate. In the event that the City Council does not or cannot appoint a person or committee to prepare a statement, the Clerk will publish any statement received or submitted by any citizen, subject to appropriate editing. 
(Ord. 2847 Sec. 1(part), 1984)

(b)  If no impact fee was paid for the immediately preceding use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate for the immediately preceding use. 
(c)  If the calculated impact fee is a negative amount, the applicant will not be required to pay impact fees nor will the applicant be compensated by the City for a negative impact fee. 
(3)  For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use, based on the applicable measurement in the impact fee rates in KMC 3.90.160. 
(4)  Impact fees shall be determined at the time the complete application for a building permit is submitted using the impact fees then in effect. Except as provided in Section 3.90.050(6) impact fees shall be due and payable before the certificate of occupancy is issued by the City.

(ii)  Pay the applicable administrative fee; 
(iii)  Grant and record at the applicant's expense a deferred impact fee lien in a form approved by the City against the property in favor of the City in the amount of the deferred impact fee that:

(D)  Binds all successors in title after the recordation; and 
(E)  Is junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees. 
(d)  The amount of impact fees deferred shall be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for a deferral. 
(e)  Prior to final inspection or 18 months from the date of original building permit issuance, the applicant may pay the deferred amount in installments, with no penalty for early payment. 
(f)  The City shall withhold final inspection until the impact fees have been paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of impact fees deferred under this subsection, the City shall execute a release of deferred impact fee lien for each single-family attached or detached residence for which the impact fees have been received. The applicant, or property owner at the time of release, shall be responsible for recording the lien release at his or her expense. 
(g)  The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection. 
(h)  If impact fees are not paid in accordance with the deferral and in accordance with the term provisions established herein, the City may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW. 
(i)  Each applicant for a single-family attached or detached residential building permit, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number or other unique identification number, is entitled to annually receive deferrals under this section for the first 21 single-family residential construction building permits.

The alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant. 
(2)  An applicant may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee structure in KMC 3.90.160, in which case the applicant shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development for which a building permit is being sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made. An independent fee calculation shall use the same methodology used to establish impact fees adopted pursuant to KMC 3.90.160. 
(3)  There is a rebuttable presumption that the calculations set forth in the rate study are valid. The director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the director reasonably deems to be inapplicable, inaccurate, incomplete, or unreliable. The director may require the applicant to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. The fees or alternative fees and the calculations therefor shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the applicant.

(3)  An applicant may request a credit for past tax for past payments made for the particular system improvements listed in the rate study as the basis for the impact fee. For each request for a credit for past payments the applicant shall submit receipts and a calculation of past payments earmarked for or proratable to the particular system improvement for which credit is requested. The director shall determine the amount of credits, if any, for past payments for system improvements. 
(4)  Any claim for credit must be received by the City prior to issuance of the building permit. The failure to timely file such a claim shall constitute an absolute bar to later request any such credit. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.090: - Adjustments for Future Tax Payments and Other Revenue Sources. 
    Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the rate study has provided adjustments for future taxes to be paid by the development authorized by the building permit which are earmarked or proratable to the same new park facilities which will serve the new development. The impact fees in KMC 3.90.160 have been reasonably adjusted for taxes and other revenue sources which are anticipated to be available to fund parks, open space, and recreation improvements. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.100: - Establishment of Impact Fee Accounts. 
(1)  The City shall establish a separate impact fee account for the parks, open space, and recreation impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter. Funds appropriated or otherwise withdrawn from the impact fees received must be used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable state law. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the accounts and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected. 
(2)  On an annual basis, the director or designee shall provide a report to the council on the impact fee accounts showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the parks, open space, and recreation improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. 
(3)  Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within ten years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reasons for the City to hold the fees beyond the ten-year period, pursuant to RCW 82.02.070(3). 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.110: - Refunds and Offsets. 
(1)  If the City fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within ten years of the date the fees were paid, unless extraordinary or compelling reasons are established pursuant to this section, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis. 
(2)  The City shall notify potential claimants of the refund by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant must be the current owner of record of the real property against which the impact fees were assessed. 
(3)  Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later. 
(4)  Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the City and expended on the system improvements for which they were collected. 
(5)  Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the City. 
(6)  When the City seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this chapter. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the City, but must be expended for the park facilities for which the impact fees were collected. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated. 
(7)  The City shall also refund to the current owner of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, however, that, if the City has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the director may decline to provide the refund. If within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar building permit, the owner can petition the director for an offset in the amount of the fee originally paid and not refunded. The petitioner must provide receipts of impact fees previously paid for a building permit of the same or substantially similar nature on the same real property or some portion thereof. The director's determinations shall be in writing and shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in KMC 3.90.140. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.120: - Use of Impact Fees. 
(1)  Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees: 
(a)  Shall be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development authorized by the building permit; 
(b)  Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in park facilities; and 
(c)  Shall not be used for maintenance or operation. 
(2)  Impact fees may be spent for system improvements including, but not limited to, planning, land acquisition, right-of-way acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized. 
(3)  Impact fees may also be used to recoup system improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs. 
(4)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, such impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this chapter. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.130: - Review and Adjustment of Rates. 
(1)  The fees and rates set forth in the rate study may be reviewed and adjusted by the council as it deems necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual budget process so that adjustments, if any, will be effective at the first of the calendar year subsequent to budget period under review. 
(2)  The fees and rates set forth in the rate study may be amended to reflect changes to the 20-year park project list as part of adoption of amendments to the capital facilities element of the City's Comprehensive Plan. Amendment to the schedule for this purpose shall be adopted by the council. 
(3)  Annually, and prior to the first day of January, the Director shall adjust the fees by the same percentage changes as in the most recent annual change of the Construction Cost Index published in the Engineering News Record (ENR) for the Kennewick area. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.140: - Review by Director and Appeals. 
(1)  The applicant may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest so that the Certificate of Occupancy, or a change in use when no building permit is required, can be issued. No appeal shall be permitted until the impact fees at issue have been paid. 
(2)  Requests for review regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may be filed only by the applicant for the development activity at issue. 
(3)  The applicant must first file a request for review regarding impact fees with the Director, as provided herein: 
(a)  The request shall be in writing on the form provided by the City; 
(b)  The request for review by the Director shall be filed within 14 calendar days after the applicant's payment of the impact fee at issue; 
(c)  The failure to timely file such a request shall constitute a final bar to later seek such review; 
(d)  No administrative fee will be imposed for the request for review by the Director; 
(e)  The Director shall issue his/her determination in writing. 
(4)  Determinations of the Director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the Director's decision concerning the independent fee calculation which is authorized in Section 3.90.060, or any other determination which the Director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, may be appealed by the applicant or owner to the Hearing Examiner per KMC 4.02. The appeal, in the form of a letter of appeal, must be delivered to the Community Planning Department within 14 calendar days after issuance of the decision of the Director. The failure to timely file an appeal shall constitute a final bar to later seek such review. In those cases where the proposed development activity may require a public hearing under the authority of other chapters of the KMC the hearings may be combined. For example, if the underlying development permit application is a preliminary plat, the appeal shall be heard at the preliminary plat public hearing. The Hearing Examiner may conduct an open record appeal hearing. The Hearing Examiner only determines whether the fee is reasonable, but does not make adjustment thereto. The Hearing Examiner may remand the matter to the Parks and Recreation Director for further consideration consistent with the Hearing Examiner's findings and decision. 
( Ord. 5736 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
3.90.150: - Existing Authority Unimpaired. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from requiring the applicant or the proponent of a development authorized by a building permit to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the building permit process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions. Such mitigation shall not duplicate the impact fees charged under this chapter.

CHAPTER 4.02 - HEARING EXAMINER 

4.02.010: - General Objectives. 
    It is the general objective of this Chapter to: 
(1)  With regard to land use matters to: 
(a)  Provide a single, efficient, integrated, land use regulatory decision-making process and public hearing system; 
(b)  Render land use regulatory decisions; 
(c)  Provide a greater degree of due process in land use regulatory decision-making and public hearings; 
(d)  Separate land use policy formulation from land use policy administration processes; 
(2)  With regard to other matters to: 
(a)  Provide a single, efficient integrated system for hearing appeals of administrative decisions; 
(b)  Provide a forum to hear other matters as established by City Code. 
(Ord. 5321 Sec. 1, 2010) 
4.02.020: - Creation of the Hearing Examiner. 
    The office of the Hearing Examiner, hereinafter referred to as "Examiner," is hereby created. The Examiner shall interpret, review, and implement land use regulations as provided in this Title and other ordinances, issues and matters as assigned, delegated and/or referred to the Examiner. The term "Examiner" shall likewise include the Examiner Pro Tem. 
(Ord. 5321 Sec. 1, 2010) 
4.02.030: - Appointment and Term. 
    The Hearing Examiner shall be appointed by the City Manager and subject to confirmation by the Kennewick City Council. In the event that the appointed Examiner is unable to perform the duties of office for whatever reason, or in the event of a vacancy in office, the City Manager shall appoint an Examiner Pro Tem who shall have the authorities herein provided.

Participants in the land use regulatory process have the right, insofar as possible, to have the Examiner free from personal interest or prehearing contacts on land use regulatory matters considered by him.

Any application, approved pursuant to this Chapter, shall be implemented within one year of such approval unless other time limits are prescribed elsewhere. Any application, which is not so implemented, shall terminate at the conclusion of that period of time and become null and void. The Examiner may grant one extension of time for a maximum of one year for good cause shown. The burden of justification shall rest with the applicant.

The Responsible Official will determine the lead agency in accord with WAC 197-11-050 and WAC 197-11-922 through WAC 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or he is aware that another agency is in the process of determining the lead agency. 
(2)  If the City is the lead agency, the department receiving or initiating a proposal will forward the application to the Responsible Official who will make the threshold determination and, if an EIS is necessary, supervise its preparation. 
(3)  If the City is not the lead agency, the department must use and consider the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on its proposal. No department will prepare or require a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency unless required by WAC 197-11-600. The City may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600. 
(4)  If the City receives a lead agency determination which appears inconsistent with WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. The objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination. If not resolved within 15 days, the Responsible Official may petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination. 
(5)  Departments may make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties, but the Responsible Official and any affected department must approve the agreement. 
(6)  Any department taking a license application must obtain sufficient information to identify other agencies which may have jurisdiction over the proposal. 
(Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984) 
4.08.050: - Transfer of Lead Agency Status to a State Agency. 
    The Responsible Official may transfer lead agency status over a private project to the State agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority list of WAC 197-11-936. The City will remain an agency with jurisdiction. The Responsible Official must send notice of the transfer together with all relevant information on the proposal to the State agency. He will also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and all other agencies with jurisdiction. 
(Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984; Ord. 2486 Sec. 1, 1980) 
4.08.060: - Time for Making Threshold Determinations. 
    The following time limits (expressed in calendar days) apply to all private projects and proposals by other agencies: 
(1)  Categorical Exemptions. The City will identify categorical exemptions within seven days of receiving a complete application. 
(2)  Threshold Determination. The City will make a threshold determination which can be based solely upon the environmental checklist within 45 days of receiving an adequate application and completed checklist. 
(Ord. 3644 Sec. 2, 1996; Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984; Ord. 2486 Sec. 1, 1980)

4.08.110: - Categorical Exemptions. 
(1)  The following types of construction are categorically exempt except when undertaken in any part on lands covered by water, within 300 feet of any areas which might contain aquatic resources, including wetlands, streams, or other areas where surface water or groundwater might collect, pond or flow or parcels designated as "Survey Highly Advised: Very High Risk" by the Washington State Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation: 
(a)  The construction or location of single family residential structures of 30 dwelling units or less. 
(b)  The construction or location of multi-family residential structures of 60 dwelling units or less. 
(c)  The construction of a barn, loafing shed, farm equipment storage building, produce storage or packing structure, or similar agricultural structure in an agricultural zone, covering 40,000 square feet or less, and to be used only by the property owner or his agent in farming the property. This exemption does not apply to feed lots. 
(d)  The construction of an office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage building with 20,000 square feet of gross floor area, or less, and with associated parking facilities designed for 90 automobiles or less. 
(e)  The construction of a parking lot designed for 90 automobiles or less. 
(f)  Any landfill or excavation of 1,000 cubic yards or less throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any fill or excavation classified as a class I, II or III forest practice under RCW 76.09.050 or regulations thereunder. 
(2)  If the Responsible Official believes that special circumstances warrant further environmental review, he may so direct even for categorically exempt projects. 
(Ord. 5669 Sec. 1, 2016; Ord. 5392 Sec. 1, 2011; Ord. 3644 Sec. 3, 1996; Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984) 
4.08.120: - Use of Exemptions. 
(1)  Each department receiving an application for a license or making a proposal, will determine if it is exempt. Its determination is final and not subject to review and none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply. No environmental checklist is required for exempt proposals. 
(2)  Each department will properly define each proposal and identify the licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the City will determine the lead agency even if the license is exempt. 
(3)  The City may authorize exempt actions before nonexempt so long as there is no significant adverse impact on the environment and choices are not limited, but may withhold approval which might lead to modification of the physical environment which would serve no purpose if nonexempt action were not approved, or might financially burden a private applicant if nonexempt action were not approved. 
(Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984; Ord. 2486 Sec. 1, 1980) 
4.08.130: - Environmental Checklist. 
(1)  A completed environmental checklist must be filed with all license applications unless exempt, but a checklist is not needed if the City and applicant agree that an EIS is required or SEPA compliance has been completed or initiated by another agency. The City will use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and make the threshold determination. 
(2)  The applicant must complete the environmental checklist. The City will assist as necessary. The department making a proposal must complete the environmental checklist. 
(3)  The City and not the private applicant will complete the environmental checklist if the City has technical information that is unavailable to the applicant or the applicant has previously given inaccurate information. The costs of preparing the checklist must be paid by the applicant before final approval. 
(Ord. 2873 Sec. 1(part), 1984; Ord. 2486 Sec. 1, 1980) 
4.08.140: - Mitigated DNS-Early Notice. 
(1)  As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the Responsible Official may issue a determination of non-significance (DNS) based on conditions he attaches to the proposal or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant. 
(2)  An applicant may request early notice of the likelihood of a DS. His written request must be made after his application and environmental checklist but before the City's actual threshold determination. 
(3)  The Responsible Official will respond within 15 working days indicating whether the City considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, the areas of concern. The applicant may change or clarify his proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts and revise his environmental checklist or license application. 
(4)  The City will assist in identifying the impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigating measures. 
(5)  If an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal or a revised environmental checklist, the City will base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal within 15 days. 
(a)  If the proposal includes sufficient, specific, mitigating measures, the City will issue and circulate a determination of non-significance. 
(b)  The City will make the threshold determination if the proposal does not include sufficient, specific, mitigating measures. 
(c)  Proposed, mitigating measures must be in writing and specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent storm water runoff" are inadequate. Proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "construct 200 feet storm water retention pond at Y location" are adequate. 
(d)  Mitigating measures may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency reports, studies or other documents. 
(6)  A mitigated DNS is subject to a 15-day comment period and public notice. 
(7)  Mitigating measures incorporated in a DNS become conditions of the license and will be enforced accordingly. 
(8)  The City's Early Notice is not a determination of significance. Discussion on clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, do not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination.

CHAPTER 4.12 - PERMIT PROCESS 

4.12.010: - Findings. 
    The City Council finds and declares the following: 
(1)  As the number of environmental laws and development regulations has increased for land uses and development, so has the number of required land use permits, each with its own separate approval process. 
(2)  The increasing number of local and state land use permits and separate environmental review processes required by agencies has generated continuing potential for conflict, overlap, and duplication between the various permit and review processes. 
(3)  This regulatory burden has significantly added to the cost and time needed to obtain local and state land use permits and has made it difficult for the public to know how and when to provide timely comments on land use proposals that require multiple permits and have separate environmental review processes. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.015: - Applicability. 
    These rules apply to all land use permits under Titles 5, 15, 17, and 18, and to any related regulation implementing these provisions or any other ordinance or law. Unless another department is the primary agency in a permit process, the Director of Planning administers those chapters and may adopt such rules as will assist in administering these provisions. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.020: - Definitions. 
    Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this Chapter. 
(1)  Closed Record Appeal means an administrative appeal on the record following an open record hearing on a project permit application when the appeal is on the record with no or limited new evidence or information allowed to be submitted and only appeal argument allowed. 
(2)  Director means the Director of Planning unless another department or agency is in charge of the project permit in which case it refers to the chief administrative officer of that department or agency. 
(3)  Open Record Hearing means a hearing, conducted by a single hearing body or officer that creates the record through testimony and submission of evidence and information. An open record hearing may be held prior to a decision on a project permit to be known as an "open record pre-decision hearing." An open record hearing may be held on an appeal, to be known as an "open record appeal hearing," if no open record pre-decision hearing has been held on the project permit. 
(4)  Project Permit or Project Permit Application means any land use or environmental permit or license required from the City for a project action, including, but not limited to, building permits, subdivisions, binding site plans, planned unit developments, conditional uses, shoreline substantial development permits, site plan review, permits or approvals required by critical area ordinances, site-specific rezones authorized by a comprehensive plan or subarea plan, but excluding the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan, subarea plan, or development regulations except as otherwise specifically included in this subsection. 
(5)  Public Meeting means an informal meeting, hearing, workshop, or other public gathering of people to obtain comments from the public or other agencies on a proposed project permit prior to a decision. A public meeting may include, but is not limited to, a design review or architectural control board meeting, a special review district or community council meeting, or a scoping meeting on a draft environmental impact statement. A public meeting does not include an open record hearing. The proceedings at a public meeting may be recorded and a report or recommendation may be included in the local government's project permit application file. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.030: - Purpose. 
    In enacting Sections 4.12.040 and 4.12.050, the City Council intends to establish a mechanism for implementing the provisions of Chapter 36.70A RCW regarding compliance, conformity, and consistency of proposed projects with adopted comprehensive plans and development regulations. In order to achieve this purpose the City Council finds that: 
(1)  Given the extensive investment that public agencies and a broad spectrum of the public are making and will continue to make in comprehensive plans and development regulations for their communities, it is essential that project review start from the fundamental land use planning choices made in these plans and regulations. If the applicable regulations or plans identify the type of land use, specify residential density in urban growth areas, and identify and provide for funding of public facilities needed to serve the proposed development and site, these decisions at a minimum provide the foundation for further project review unless there is a question of code interpretation. The project review process, including the environmental review process under Chapter 43.21C RCW and the consideration of consistency, should start from this point and should not reanalyze these land use planning decisions in making a permit decision. 
(2)  Comprehensive plans and development regulations adopted by the City under Chapter 36.70A RCW and environmental laws and rules adopted by the state and federal government have addressed a wide range of environmental subjects and impacts. These provisions typically require environmental studies and contain specific standards to address various impacts associated with a proposed development, such as building size and location, drainage, transportation requirements, and protection of critical areas. When a permitting agency applies these existing requirements to a proposed project, some or all of a project's potential environmental impacts will be avoided or otherwise mitigated. Through the integrated project review process described in subsection (1) of this Section, the Director will determine whether existing requirements, including the applicable regulations or plans, adequately analyze and address a project's environmental impacts. Project review should not require additional studies or mitigation under Chapter 43.21C RCW where existing regulations have adequately addressed a proposed project's probable specific adverse environmental impacts. 
(3)  Consistency should be determined in the project review process by considering four factors found in applicable regulations or plans: The type of land use allowed; the level of development allowed, such as units per acre or other measures of density; infrastructure, such as the adequacy of public facilities and services to serve the proposed project; and the character of the proposed development, such as compliance with specific development standards. This uniform approach corresponds to existing project review practices and will not place a burden on applicants or local government. The City intends that this approach should be largely a matter of checking compliance with existing requirements for most projects, which are simple or routine, while more complex projects may require more analysis. 
(4)  When an applicant applies for a project permit, consistency between the proposed project and applicable regulations or plan should be determined through a project review process that integrates land use and environmental impact analysis, so that governmental and public review of the proposed project, by development regulations under Chapter 36.70A RCW, and by the environmental process under Chapter 43.21C RCW run concurrently and not separately. 
(5)  The project review process should address consistency between a proposed project and the applicable regulations or plan: 
(a)  A uniform framework for the meaning of consistency; 
(b)  An emphasis on relying on existing requirements and adopted standards, with the use of supplemental authority as specified by Chapter 43.21C RCW to the extent that existing requirements do not adequately address a project's specific probable adverse environmental impacts; and 
(c)  The identification of three basic land use planning choices made in applicable regulations or plans that, at a minimum, serve as a foundation for project review and that should not be reanalyzed during project permitting. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.040: - Scope of Review. 
(1)  Fundamental land use planning choices made in adopted comprehensive plans and development regulations shall serve as the foundation for project review. The review of a proposed project's consistency with applicable development regulations, or in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted Comprehensive Plan, under Section 4.12.050 shall incorporate the determinations under this section. 
(2)  During project review, the Director or any subsequent reviewing body shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project or, in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted Comprehensive Plan. At a minimum, such applicable regulations or plans shall be determinative of the: 
(a)  Type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, such as planned unit developments and conditional and special uses, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied; 
(b)  Density of residential development in urban growth areas; and 
(c)  Availability and adequacy of public facilities identified in the Comprehensive Plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by Chapter 36.70A RCW. 
(3)  During project review, the Director shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in subsection (2) of this section including issues of code interpretation. 
(4)  The Director may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis and mitigation measures in development regulations and other applicable laws provide adequate mitigation for some or all of the project's specific adverse environmental impacts to which the requirements apply. 
(5)  Nothing in this section limits the authority of the City to approve, condition, or deny a project as provided in its development regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW and in its policies adopted under RCW 43.21C.060. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, transportation demand management, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal's probable adverse environmental impacts, if applicable. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996). 
4.12.050: - Project Consistency. 
(1)  A proposed project's consistency with development regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or, in the absence of applicable development regulations, the appropriate elements of the Comprehensive Plan or subarea plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW shall be determined by consideration of: 
(a)  The type of land use; 
(b)  The level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density; 
(c)  Infrastructure, including public facilities and services needed to serve the development; and 
(d)  The character of the development, such as development standards. 
(2)  In determining consistency, the determinations made pursuant to Section 4.12.040 of this Chapter shall be controlling. 
(3)  For purposes of this Section, the term "consistency" shall include all terms used in this Chapter and Chapter 36.70A RCW to refer to performance in accordance with this Chapter and Chapter 36.70A RCW, including but not limited to compliance, conformity, and consistency. 
(4)  Nothing in this Section requires documentation, dictates procedures for considering consistency, or limits the Director from asking more specific or related questions with respect to any of the four main categories listed in subsection (1)(a) through (d) of this Section. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.055: - Project Concurrency. 
(1)  Concurrency is defined by GMA to mean that needed improvements for water, sewer, and transportation for development proposals are in place at the time of development; or in the case of transportation, that a financial commitment exists to complete the improvements within six years. 
(2)  The concept of concurrency is based on maintenance of specified levels of service (LOS) for water, sewer, and transportation. Level of service standards represents the minimum performance level desired for transportation facilities and services, and the minimum availability of water and sewer. 
(3)  Development permit or project permit means any land use permit required from the City for a project action, including, but not limited to, subdivisions, site plans designated as Tier 2 or Tier 3, planned unit developments, conditional uses, shoreline substantial development permits, but excluding non-site specific development permits such as the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan, subarea plan, or development regulations. 
(4)  The following development permit applications shall be subject to a finding of approval for concurrency conducted in the processing of the development permit application: 
(a)  Preliminary plat (subdivision of ten or more residential lots); 
(b)  Site plans designated as Tier 2 or Tier 3; 
(c)  Any other land use plan or permit which would increase the demand for transportation facilities by 50 or more peak hour trips per day (based upon the latest ITE Trip Generation Manual or other data, including LOS, as approved by the City's traffic engineer). 
CITY OF KENNEWICK 
LOS FOR TRANSPORTATION LOS Signalized Intersections - Existing Level of Service "D" Unsignalized Intersections or Driveways - Minor Street Approach Level of Service "E" Signalized or Unsignalized Intersection with Second Site Access Point within 1/4 mile having a LOS D or better Level of Service "F"  
(d)  Any land use plan or permit that would increase the demand for potable water and/or the demand for sewer requirements above the LOS indicated within the following table for domestic use, or the current water and sewer system plans for commercial or industrial use. 
CITY OF KENNEWICK 
LOS FOR WATER AND SEWER LOS Domestic Water 170 gallons per capita per day Domestic Sewer 120 gallons per capita per day Commercial or Industrial Water and Sewer Per Water and Sewer System Plan  
(5)  If project concurrency for transportation, as defined in Section 4.12.055(1) cannot be met, WAC 365-195-510(1) requires that the project must be denied unless the applicant does one or both of the following to the satisfaction of the City Traffic Engineer or designee: 
(a)  Amend the application to reduce the need for capacity improvements of transportation facilities in order to maintain the adopted level of service; or 
(b)  Arrange to provide capacity for transportation facilities that is not otherwise available. 
(6)  The following development permits are exempt from this section and applicants may submit applications, obtain permits, and commence development without a finding of approval for concurrency, unless otherwise determined by the Director: 
(a)  Uses that were disclosed in a completed application filed before the effective date of this section; 
(b)  Any land use plan or permit that would not increase the demand for transportation facilities by more than 50 peak hour trips per day unless the affected transportation facilities are operating at, or lower than, the adopted level-of-service for the facility; 
(c)  Any land use plan or permit that would increase the demand for potable water and/or the demand for sewer requirements by less than those provided within the current water and sewer system plans. 
(7)  When required as per KMC 4.12.055(3), the City shall not issue a development permit until: 
(a)  A finding of approval for concurrency has been made in accordance with established transportation, water and sewer levels of service and a certificate of concurrency has been issued; or 
(b)  The application has been determined to be exempt from the concurrency requirement as provided in subsection (6) of this section. 
(8)  A finding of approval for concurrency, to determine if adequate capacity exists, shall be provided by the City Traffic Engineer or designee for transportation; and for water and sewer by the Utilities Services Manager or designee, for developments not otherwise exempt from the requirements of this section. 
(9)  The level of service standards for transportation facilities adopted in KAC 13.08.030(5) Design Level-of-Service and as amended, will be used in conducting the concurrency test. 
(10)  The levels of service standards for water and sewer service, as adopted in the Water and Sewer Plan and as amended, will be used in conducting the concurrency test. 
(11)  A finding of approval for concurrency: 
(a)  Is valid only for the development permit with which it was issued and for subsequent development permits for the same property as long as the applicant obtains the subsequent development permit and where the use or intensity has not changed and the previous development permit has not expired; and 
(b)  Will be valid for the same period of time as the development permit with which it was issued; and 
(c)  Can be extended for the same time as a development permit's extension; and 
(d)  Runs with the land and cannot be transferred to a different property but transfers automatically with ownership of the property; and 
(e)  Shall expire if the underlying development permit expires or is revoked or denied by the City and has not been extended to a subsequent development permit for the same property. 
(12)  A finding of approval for concurrency shall be an administrative action of the City and is categorically exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). 
(13)  Projects not meeting the minimum threshold for concurrency review for sewer, water, or transportation are not exempt from other mitigation measures that would be determined during the normal development approval process. 
(Ord. 5179 Sec. 1, 2007) 
4.12.060: - Note of Complete Application. 
(1)  Within 28 days after receiving a project permit application, the Director shall mail or provide in person a written determination to the applicant, stating either:

In determining the number of days that have elapsed after the Director has notified the applicant that the application is complete, the following periods shall be excluded: 
(a)  (i)  Any period during which the applicant has been requested to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. The period shall be calculated from the date the Director notifies the applicant of the need for additional information until the earlier of the date the Director determines whether the additional information satisfies the request for information or 14 days after the date the information has been provided; 
(ii)  If the Director determines that the information submitted by the applicant under (a)(i) of this subsection is insufficient, he shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and the procedures under (a)(i) of this subsection shall apply as if a new request for studies had been made; 
(b)  Any period during which an environmental impact statement is being prepared following a determination of significance pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW; 
(c)  Any period for administrative appeals of project permits, if an open record appeal hearing or a closed record appeal, or both, are allowed. The time period for considering and deciding shall not exceed: 
(i)  Ninety days for an open record appeal hearing; and 
(ii)  Sixty days for a closed record appeal. 
The parties to an appeal may agree to extend these time periods; and 
(d)  Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Director. 
(2)  The time limits established by subsection (1) of this section do not apply if a project permit application: 
(a)  Requires an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or a development regulation; 
(b)  Requires approval of a new fully contained community as provided in RCW 36.70A.350, a master planned resort as provided in RCW 36.70A.360, or the siting of an essential public facility as provided in RCW 36.70A.200; or 
(c)  Is substantially revised by the applicant, in which case the time period shall start from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be complete under Section 4.12.060. 
(3)  If the Director is unable to issue its final decision within the time limits provided for in this section, it shall provide written notice of this fact to the project applicant. The notice shall include a statement of reasons why the time limits have not been met and an estimated date for issuance of the notice of final decision. 
(Ord. 3642 Sec. 1, 1996) 
4.12.075: - Expiration of Applications and Permits. 
(1)  Incomplete Application/Additional Information. 
(a)  The application shall expire if the applicant fails to provide the required information within 90 days of the following:

(b)  Expired applications must be resubmitted as new applications requiring repayment of all applicable fees. 
(c)  Prior to the expiration date, the applicant may request, in writing, an extension of time. The Director may grant a 90-day extension on a one-time basis if the required studies or information warrant additional time. 
(2)  Permits. 
(a)  Absent statute or ordinance provisions to the contrary, and excluding Subdivisions (KMC 17.10 Platting), any application for which a conditional approval has been made and for which no substantial progress has been made to meet permit approval requirements for a period of 180 days after the permit's conditional approval, the application will expire and become null and void. 
(i)  Phased Site Plans: Phased site plans shall expire in accord with KMC 4.12.075(2)(a). In addition, once a phase is completed and a Certificate of Occupancy is issued, the application will expire and become null and void if an application for final site plan approval for another phase is not applied for within 190 days. 
(b)  Expired applications must be resubmitted as new applications requiring repayment of all applicable fees. 
(c)  Prior to the expiration date, the applicant may request, in writing, an extension of time. The Director shall grant a 180-day extension on a one-time basis. 
(Ord. 5644 Sec. 1, 2016; Ord. 5468 Sec. 1, 2012) 
4.12.080: - Agent. 
    The Director may require the applicant for a project permit to designate a single person or entity to receive determinations and notices required by this Chapter.

(8)  The Director shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible with other agencies in holding a joint hearing if requested to do so, as long as: 
(a)  The agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so; 
(b)  Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each of the agencies' adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance, or rule; and 
(c)  The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant to hold its hearing at the same time as the City's hearing. 
(9)  An administrative appeal of the project decision, combined with any environmental determinations, shall be filed within 14 days after the notice of the decision or after other notice that the decision has been made and is appealable. The appeal period shall be extended for an additional seven days, if state or local rules adopted pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW allow public comment on a determination of non-significance issued as part of the appealable project permit decision. 
(10)  The applicant for a project permit is deemed to be a participant in any comment period, open record hearing, or closed record appeal.

(1)  All project permits and project permit applications, except zone changes, plats, street vacations, and other legislative decisions, shall be processed and reviewed in the following manner, upon receipt of a completed application: 
(a)  For an application requiring legislative action or which is illegal, the application shall be denied or processed in accord with subsection (2). 
(b)  For applications which involve more than one permit, the City will prepare a temporary schedule for review by all interested agencies, departments, and the applicant. The schedule will be prepared during the application completion determination in accord with Section 4.12.060. 
(c)  Depending upon the scope of the project, the City will schedule necessary public meetings to coordinate the permit process and gather information following appropriate notification as provided in Section 4.12.090. 
(d)  Unless otherwise required, no open record hearing will be held unless there is a bona fide objection to some portion of the permit or from some determination made during the course of the permit processing. When required, only one open record hearing will be held. The open record hearing will be before the officer or body having jurisdiction over the matter in dispute or over the matter requiring the open record hearing. If the matter disputed or for which an open record hearing is required falls within the jurisdiction of more than one department or agency, a joint hearing will be held if practical. 
(e)  A decision or joint decision if possible, shall be issued and notice given thereof, including the time for appeal and the person or body to whom the appeal must be made. Unless another time is provided, an appeal must be filed within ten days of the decision. The longest appeal period following a joint hearing controls if there are multiple appeal periods. 
(f)  The body or bodies with appellate jurisdiction shall hold a joint closed record appeal. An open record appeal may be held for matters for which no open record hearing has previously been held. The decision of the person or bodies hearing the appeal may be joint or separate. Every effort shall be made in the event of separate decisions to ensure that they are issued simultaneously. Any review of the decision or decisions must be made to the superior court within 21 days. 
(g)  In the event that no appellate body is designated for a matter, the matter shall be heard by the Hearing Examiner. 
(2)  If the decision on an application must be made by the Kennewick City Council, the application will normally be denied until legislative approval has been obtained. Except for Comprehensive Plan Amendments which may never be processed other than as part of the annual review, an applicant may request combined processing in accord with subsection (1) of this section. 
(3)  The actual costs of any hearing or appeal not otherwise required will be borne by the person requesting the review or objecting to a decision. Security for the costs must be posted prior to the setting or notice of hearing or appeal. The failure to post security is a waiver of any objection.

CHAPTER 4.14 - SMALL CELL DEPLOYMENT: FRANCHISE AND SMALL CELL PERMITS 

4.14.010: - Overview. 
    In order to manage its right-of-way in a thoughtful manner which balances the need to accommodate new and evolving technologies with the preservation of the natural and aesthetic environment of the City while complying with the requirements of State and federal law, the City of Kennewick has adopted this process for the deployment of small cell and microcell technology. Service providers who seek to utilize the public right-of-way for small cell deployment in order to provide wireless communication, data transmission or other related services to the citizens of the City must have a valid franchise to provide the specific service and a Small Cell Permit to deploy the technology. Entities with franchises who wish to utilize a small cell deployment to upgrade or expand their services shall utilize the processes set forth in this ordinance and implementing Small Cell Permits to deploy their technology and obtain design approval of specific installations. The Small Cell Permit process administers deployment under the franchise. An entity without a franchise shall apply for a franchise and adjunct Small Cell Permit which shall be processed concurrently as one Master Permit within the meaning of RCW 35.99.010(3) and 35.99.030. For entities with a valid franchise, see KMC 4.14. All required permits for a small cell deployment shall be consolidated for review. 
(1)  Nothing in this ordinance revises or diminishes the rights and obligations of an existing franchise. 
(2)  The term "small cell deployment" shall include the deployment of small cell facilities and small cell networks as small wireless facilities as that term is defined by 47 CFR  1.6002. Small cell deployment elements which require SEPA, Critical Areas or Shorelines review shall comply with those review processes. 
(3)  Definitions for terms used in this chapter can be found in KMC Chapter 4.16. 
( Ord. 5792 Sec. 1 (part) 2018 ; Ord. 5733 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
4.14.020: - Application. 
    Applicants shall apply using the City's franchise application form and submit a $500.00 fee. See Chapter 5.20 KMC for basic requirements. The Director and his or her designee shall coordinate review with the Planning Director with respect to small cell deployments which require review under KMC 18.12.315 in one consolidated process. Phased development is permitted and an applicant is encouraged to specify at least the initial small cell deployment in its application. 
    The following information shall be provided by all applicants for franchises seeking to utilize small cell deployment in addition to the information provided pursuant to Chapter 5.20 KMC. Existing franchisees who seek to utilize a small cell deployment to expand, assist or implement an existing franchise may provide the information as a part of a Small Cell Permit application for small cell deployment. 
(1)  Designation of Facilities. The application shall provide specific locational information including GIS coordinates of all facilities, and specify whether and where small cell facilities are to be located on existing utility poles including City-owned light standards (included in the definition of utility pole), or will utilize replacement utility poles, new poles, towers, and/or other structures. Conduit and/or ground-mounted equipment necessary for and intended for use in the deployment shall also be specified regardless of whether the additional facilities are to be constructed by the applicant or leased from an infrastructure provider. Detailed schematics and visual renderings of the facilities shall be provided by the applicant. Failure to provide sufficient detail may result in a later finding of a significant change in the facility if the facility is not accurately shown on the originally approved franchise exhibit. Failure to specify elements may also result in the requirement that new or undocumented elements complete the approval processes detailed in this Chapter and/or KMC 4.16. 
(2)  Implementation. The rights granted under a franchise are implemented through the issuance of Small Cell Permits. The franchise application may be accompanied by application for a Small Cell Permit to deploy small cells. An initial franchise and all related Small Cell Permit applications including right-of-way use permits shall be processed concurrently as one Master Permit. See RCW 35.99.010(3) for the definition of "master permit." 
(a)  Issuance of a Small Cell Permit to install a small cell deployment shall be contingent upon approval of a franchise or the possession of a valid franchise. 
(b)  All Small Cell Permits which are submitted in conjunction with a franchise application shall be considered as one Master Permit. 
(i)  Any element of a deployment which qualifies as either an Eligible Facilities Request or a collocation shall be specifically designated by the applicant and may be addressed separately by the Director in order to comply with the shot clocks established by federal law and KMC 4.16. 
(c)  The Director may approve, deny or conditionally approve all or any portion of the sites proposed in the Small Cell Permit application. 
(d)  Any application for a franchise or Small Cell Permit which contains an element which is not exempt from Critical Areas, Shorelines or SEPA review shall simultaneously apply under Chapter 43.21C RCW and Chapters 4.08 and 18.58 to 18.68. 
(e)  RF Certification. The applicant shall submit a sworn affidavit signed by an RF Engineer with knowledge of the proposed project affirming that the small cell deployment will be compliant with all FCC and other governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency emissions for every frequency at which the small cell facility will operate. If facilities necessary to the Small Cell Deployment are to be provided by another franchisee, then the Small Cell Deployment in the initial franchise or in a subsequent Small Cell Permit shall be conditioned on an RF Certification showing the cumulative impact of the RF emissions on the entire installation. 
(f)  Regulatory Authorization. Issuance of the Use Permit for the facilities shall also be contingent upon the applicant's provision of proof of FCC and other regulatory approvals required to provide the service(s) or utilize the technologies sought to be installed. 
(g)  Recognizing that small cell technology is rapidly evolving, the Public Works Director is authorized to adopt and publish standards for the technological and structural safety of City-owned light standards and utility structures and to formulate and publish application questions for use when an applicant seeks to attach to City-owned utility structures. 
( Ord. 5792 Sec. 1 (part), 2018 ; Ord. 5733 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
4.14.030: - Review Process. 
    The following provisions relate to applications for a franchise and/or Small Cell Permit for small cell deployments. 
(1)  Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 USC 253 and 47 USC 332 and applicable case law. Applicants for franchises and all permits including Small Cell permits which implement the franchise shall be treated in a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory manner with other service providers utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent, that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement or cumulative impacts. Franchise and Small Cell Permit review under this chapter shall be conducted in a manner which neither prohibits nor has the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services. 
(2)  Concealment. In any zone not designated by KMC 18.12.315(5) for design review ("design review"), upon application for a Small Cell Permit or for facilities designated within a franchise, the City will permit small cell deployment on existing utility poles and replacement poles conforming to the City's generally applicable pole design standard adopted pursuant to KMC 4.14.050. Accordingly, small cell facilities installed pursuant to this concealment authorization may not be expanded pursuant to an Eligible Facilities Request. 
(3)  Design Review. Small cell deployment in Design Zones and Undergrounded Areas, as well as certain new or replacement facilities, are subject to design review. See KMC 18.12.315. 
( Ord. 5792 Sec. 1 (part), 2018 ; Ord. 5733 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
4.14.040: - Facilities Designated in the Franchise and/or Small Cell Permit Application. 
    Small cell deployments may be approved by reference to exhibits in an approved franchise. Approval of the franchise shall be deemed to approve the site and the design of small cell facilities set forth in the franchise. This approval is limited to the specific location, facility and design elements shown on the exhibits to the franchise. Any element not shown on an exhibit must be approved by the governing review processes listed in KMC 4.14.050, 4.14.060, 4.14.070 and, when applicable, KMC 18.12.315. All facilities shall comply with the concealment standards adopted by the City in KMC 4.14.050 and/or KMC 18.12.315. An existing franchisee may, at its option: 
(1)  Apply to amend the existing franchise to designate sites for small cell deployment, as well as approve the small cell facilities to be installed and the concealment measures to be utilized; and/or 
(2)  Apply for a Small Cell Permit which may include: 
(a)  Small cell facilities to be installed on existing utility poles or replacement poles which do not exceed ten feet in additional height, and which utilize the concealment option provided in KMC 4.14.050; and/or 
(b)  Small cell facilities which comply with generally applicable objective design standards adopted by the City in KMC 4.14.050; and/or 
(c)  Small cell facilities which require new utility poles or replacement poles which exceed ten feet in additional height or installations in a Design Zone or Undergrounded Areas, utilize the design approval procedures set forth in KMC 4.14.050. 
( Ord. 5792 Sec. 1 (part), 2018 ; Ord. 5733 Sec. 1 (part), 2017 ) 
4.14.050: - Aesthetic design and concealment standards for small cell deployments. 
    Small cell deployments whether permitted on the right-of way under this Chapter or permitted in accordance with 18.12.315 KMC shall conform to the following design standards: 
(1)  Small Cell Facilities Attached to Non-Wooden Poles. Small cell facilities attached to existing or replacement non-wooden light poles and other non-wooden poles in the right-of-way or poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria: 
(a)  Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures shall be sited and installed in a manner which minimizes the visual impact on the streetscape either by fully concealing the antennae and associated equipment fully within the pole or through a concealment element plan which provides an equivalent or greater impact reduction. This requirement shall be applied in a manner which does not dictate the technology employed by the service provider nor unreasonably impair the technological performance of the equipment chosen by the service provider. 
(b)  All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment. 
(c)  An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than six feet above the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that it appears as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted to match the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas which shall not require screening. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and integrated with the pole. 
(d)  Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the contiguous right-of-way. 
(e)  The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than ten feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary for adequate clearance from electrical wires, whichever is greater. 
(f)  The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the City's setback and sidewalk clearance requirements, ADA requirements, and if a replacement light standard then with the City's lighting requirements. 
(g)  The use of the pole for the siting of a small cell facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small cell facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small cell facility and the small cell facility and all associated equipment shall be removed. 
(2)  Wooden Pole Design Standards. Small cell facilities located on wooden poles shall conform to the following design criteria: 
(a)  The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a small cell facility; provided, that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of ten feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. 
(b)  A pole extender may be used instead of replacing an existing pole but may not increase the height of the existing pole by more than ten feet, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height increase is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. A "pole extender" as used herein is an object affixed between the pole and the antenna for the purpose of increasing the height of the antenna above the pole. The pole extender shall be painted to approximately match the color of the pole and shall substantially match the diameter of the pole measured at the top of the pole. 
(c)  Replacement wooden poles may either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the City. 
(d)  Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the wooden pole on which they are attached. 
(e)  Panel antennas shall not be mounted more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole. 
(f)  Antennas should be placed in an effort to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a wooden pole provided that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume. 
(g)  A canister antenna may be mounted on top of an existing wooden pole, which may not exceed the height requirements described in subsection (2)(b) above. A canister antenna mounted on the top of a wooden pole shall not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, and shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The canister antenna must be placed to look as if it is an extension of the pole. In the alternative, the applicant may propose a side mounted canister antenna, so long as the inside edge of the antenna is no more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole. All cables shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and the wooden pole. 
(h)  An omni-directional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing wooden pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket. 
(i)  All related equipment, including, but not limited to, ancillary equipment, radios, cables, associated shrouding, microwaves, and conduit which are mounted on wooden poles shall not be mounted more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required, and is confirmed in writing by the pole owner. 
(j)  Equipment for small cell facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground mounted pursuant to subsection (5)(a). The equipment must be placed in the smallest enclosure possible for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure may not exceed 17 cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and does not cumulatively exceed the volumetric requirements of a small cell facility, as defined by 47 CFR 1.6003. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole, if such banners or road signs are allowed by the pole owner. 
(k)  An applicant who desires to enclose its antennas and equipment within a unified enclosure may do so, so long as the facility meets the volumetric requirements of a small cell facility. To the extent possible the unified enclosure shall be placed so as to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner. 
(l)  The visual effect of the small cell facility on all other aspects of the appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible. 
(m)  The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small cell facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small cell facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small cell facility and the small cell facility and all associated equipment shall be removed unless retention of the pole is necessary to prevent an effective prohibition of service. 
(n)  All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The number of conduit shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small cell. 
(3)  Small Cell Facilities Attached to Existing Buildings. Small cell facilities attached to existing buildings, shall conform to the following design criteria: 
(a)  Small cell facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme. 
(b)  The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged. 
(c)  New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing building. 
(d)  Small cells shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building. 
(e)  Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited. 
(f)  Small cell facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces. 
(4)  Small cell facilities mounted on cables strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards: 
(a)  Each strand mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume; 
(b)  Only one strand mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing poles; 
(c)  The strand mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than five feet from the pole unless a greater instance technically necessary or is required by the pole owner for safety clearance; 
(d)  No strand mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic; 
(e)  Ground mounted equipment to accommodate a shared mounted facility is not permitted except when placed in pre-existing equipment cabinets; and 
(f)  Pole mounted equipment shall comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(g)  Such strand mounted devices must be installed to cause the least visual impact and without excess exterior cabling or wires (other than the original stand. The small cell facility shall comply with the construction standards of the owner of the strand/cabling infrastructure. 
(5)  General Requirements. 
(a)  Ground mounted equipment in the public right-of-way is prohibited, unless such facilities are placed under ground or the applicant can demonstrate that pole mounted or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators are prohibited on the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of Chapter 9.52 KMC. 
(c)  Small cell facilities are not permitted on traffic signal poles unless denial of the siting could be a prohibition or effective prohibition of the applicant's ability to provide telecommunications service in violation of 47 USC  362 and 332. 
(d)  Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction and sidewalk clearance standards, and state and federal regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way. 
(e)  Replacement poles shall be located as near as possible to the existing pole with the requirement to remove the abandoned pole. 
(f)  The design criteria as applicable to small cell facilities described herein shall be considered concealment elements and such small cell facilities may only be expanded upon an eligible facilities request described in Chapter 4.16 KMC, when the modification does not defeat the concealment elements of the facility. 
(g)  No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer's identification or identification required by governing law is allowed to be portrayed on any antenna, and any such signage on equipment enclosures shall be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose; provided that, signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate. 
(h)  Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, required by a federal or state authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan. 
(i)  Side arm mounts for antennas or equipment are prohibited. 
(j)  The preferred location of a small cell facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact. The small cell facility must adhere to all the construction standards of the pole owner. 
(k)  Antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable, shall not dominate the building or pole upon which they are attached. 
(l)  The City may consider the cumulative visual effects of small cells mounted on poles within the rights-of-way in when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the City. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the service provider. 
(m)  These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape. 
(6)  New Poles in the Rights-of-Way for Small Cell Facilities and Concealment Standards. 
(a)  New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that: 
(i)  The proposed small cell facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole in an alley, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a non-residential use in a residential zone whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure; 
(ii)  The proposed wireless communications facility receives approval for a concealment element design, as described in subsection (c) below; 
(iii)  The proposed wireless communications facility also complies with Critical Areas, Shorelines and SEPA provisions, if applicable; and 
(iv)  No new poles shall be located in a critical area or associated buffer required by the City's Critical Areas ordinance (Chapter 18.58, 18.68 KMC) except when determined to be exempt pursuant to said ordinance. 
(b)  An application for a new pole in the right-of-way is subject to an administrative use review as a minor deviation. See KMC 4.14.060. 
(c)  The concealment element design shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed wireless communications facility, including, but not limited to, fiber and power connections. 
(i)  The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of wireless communications facility installations. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights of way, including to the extent technically feasible similar height. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and texture - or the appearance thereof - as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure or otherwise integrated into the design of the structure. Use of a unified enclosure equal to or less than four cubic feet in volume may be permitted in meeting these criteria. 
(ii)  If the Director has already approved a concealment element design either for the applicant or another wireless communications facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards. 
(d)  Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsection (6)(a)(i) and (ii) the administrative use permit process may determine that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the City, the concealment element design, the City's Comprehensive Plan and the added benefits to the community. 
(e)  Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the city to locate such new pole or ground mounted equipment. This requirement also applies to replacement poles that are higher than the replaced pole, and the overall height of the replacement pole and the proposed wireless communications facility is more than 60 feet. 
(f)  Installation of small cell facilities in a design zone or undergrounded area shall be permitted by an administrative approval of a concealment plan utilizing the design and concealment standards contained in this chapter. 
(g)  These aesthetic design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant or effectively prohibit service, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections of the streetscape.

(3)  Holding Stolen Property. After notice from any law enforcement agency that an item of property has been reported as stolen, the licensee must hold that property intact and safe from alteration, damage, or commingling. He must place an identifying tag or other suitable identification upon the property so held. Property held may not be released for 120 days from the date of notification unless released by written consent of the applicable law enforcement agency or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In cases where the applicable law enforcement agency has placed a verbal hold on an item, that agency must then give written notice within ten days. If such written notice is not received within that period of time, then the hold order will cease. The licensee must give a 20-day written notice before the expiration of the 120-day holding period to the applicable law enforcement agency about the stolen property. If notice is not given within the required 20-day period, then the hold on the property must continue for an additional 120 days. The applicable law enforcement agency may renew the holding period for additional 120-day periods as necessary. After receipt of notification from a licensee, if an additional holding period is required, the applicable law enforcement agency shall give the licensee written notice, prior to the expiration of the existing hold order.

The pawnbroker shall not be required to account to the pledgor for the proceeds received from the disposition of that item. Any provision of law relating to the foreclosure and the subsequent sale of forfeited pledged items, shall not be applicable to any pledge as defined in this chapter, the title to which is transferred in accord with this section.

CHAPTER 6.60 - SECURITY SYSTEMS 

6.60.010: - Scope. 
    This Chapter licenses burglary, robbery, and other alarms designed to detect or alert the Police Department or the public generally of criminal activities and those who sell, install, and service such alarms. Because of the serious threat that false alarms pose to the public safety, the provisions of this Chapter shall be construed so as to best promote the public health, safety and welfare. The purpose of this Chapter is to encourage security alarm users and security monitoring companies to maintain the operational reliability and to properly use alarm systems to reduce unnecessary police responses to false alarms and to require in-person or other independent verification before police respond to emergency calls at premises where an automatic property or automatic burglary alarm system has a record of unreliability.

Verify means an attempt by the Monitoring Company, or its representative, to contact the Alarm Site and/or Alarm User by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary Alarm Dispatch Request. For the purpose of this ordinance, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum, that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an Alarm User who can properly identify themselves to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch. The verification process must not take more than five minutes calculated from the time that the alarm signal has been accepted by the alarm monitoring company until a decision is made whether to call for a police dispatch. The means of verification may include one or more of the following: 
(i)  The establishment of voice communication with an authorized person at or near the premises who may indicate whether or not need for immediate police assistance or investigation exists; 
(ii)  A feature that permits the alarm system user or a person authorized by the user to send a special signal to the alarm system monitoring company that will cancel an alarm immediately after it has been sent and prevent the monitoring company from requesting a police dispatch; 
(iii)  The installation of a video system that provides the alarm system monitoring company when the signal is received with the ability to ascertain that activity is occurring which warrants immediate police assistance or investigation; 
(iv)  A confirmation that a signal reflects a need for immediate police assistance or investigation either by the alarm system user, a person at or near the premises, or an alternate response agency made before dispatching police; 
(v)  An alternative system that the License Officer determines has or is likely to have a high degree of reliability; 
(vi)  Each alarm system user shall provide a written explanation of why an alarm was activated and what corrective measures have been taken to prevent a similar occurrence. This report must be made within 72 hours of the false alarm; 
(vii)  Licensees may make special arrangements with the License Officer to test or experiment with alarms on such terms and conditions as the License Officer may find appropriate; 
(viii)  Annually or upon any change in circumstances to a system or its user, each alarm system user must make a report to the License Officer containing such information as he may require in accomplishing the purpose of this Chapter. If a user fails to make such a report within 30 days of a request by the License Officer, his license is revoked. The license may be reinstated by completing the report and paying the installation fee. 
(Ord. 5079 Sec. 1, 2005; Ord. 5008 Sec. 20, 2003; Ord. 3482 Sec. 1(part), 1993; Ord. 3097 Sec. 1, 1987) 
6.60.050: - Prohibited Acts. 
(1)  No person shall cause or allow the activation of any alarm except in the event of the commission or attempted commission of a criminal act; provided, that it shall be no defense that the criminal act was a violation of this Chapter. 
(2)  No person shall cause or allow any alarm, audible on abutting property, to continue for a period in excess of 15 minutes after notice thereof. Such an alarm constitutes a public nuisance subject to summary abatement by the License Officer. 
(3)  No alarm may dial or transmit directly into the Emergency Dispatch Center (911). No alarm may dial any number without prior, written arrangements from the person in charge of the number to be called.

6.60.055: - Infraction. 
    In addition to the penalties provided in Section 6.01.150, all violations of this Chapter by an alarm system monitoring company are Class 1 infractions, and all other violations are Class 3 infractions. 
(Ord. 3482 Sec. 2, 1993) 
6.60.060: - Revocation, Suspension and Penalties. 
    For each false alarm, the License Officer may assess a fee in accord with the following schedule: 
First False Alarm within six Months = No Charge 
Second False Alarm within six months = $50.00 
Third False Alarm within six Months = $75.00 
Forth or More False Alarms within six Months = $100.00 each 
    If the License Officer finds that the potential usefulness of the alarm is outweighed by the hazard of recurring false alarms, he may suspend or revoke the license, but if the premises upon which the alarm is situated is required by law to have an alarm, he may alternatively assess a penalty not to exceed $100.00 for each false alarm in excess of three within the preceding six-month period. The License Officer, or on review the Hearing Examiner, may suspend, revoke or refuse to issue a license if the licensee or applicant has violated any of the provisions of this Title. They may also assess a penalty of not less than $25.00 nor more than $500.00. They may also order that compensatory damages or restitution be paid to anyone injured as the result of a violation. The failure of the licensee to pay an assessment, damages, or restitution automatically suspends the license until such time as they are paid. Suspensions, revocations, penalties, damages, and restitution are suspended during the course of hearing, appeal, and review unless the License Officer or Hearing Examiner finds that the licensee or applicant's claim is meritless.

Should the claimant file an affidavit of prejudice against the Chief of Police, the Chief shall forward the matter to the City Manager who shall appoint a hearing officer therefor. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled to present all relevant evidence showing that the property is not subject to forfeiture under this Section.

(10)  The failure, upon demand by a police officer, of the person in occupancy or in control of land or premises upon which the species of plant are grown or being stored, to produce an appropriate registration or proof that he is the holder thereof, constitutes authority for the seizure and forfeiture of the plants. 
(11)  Property is summarily forfeited to the City without further proceeding in the event that the owner thereof is convicted of a violation of this Chapter, 69.50 of the Revised Code of Washington or 9.32.020, inclusive, of the Kennewick Municipal Code, except in the case of conveyances, if the conviction arises from an incident involving the property to be forfeited.

CHAPTER 9.36 - AMBULANCE SERVICES

(1)  There is hereby established an emergency medical and ambulance service for the use and for the health and welfare of the residents of the City of Kennewick to be operated as a public utility of the City of Kennewick. 
(2)  The City Council is authorized by RCW 35.21.766 and Chapter 9 of the Kennewick Municipal Code ("KMC"), to set fees, rates and charges to support an ambulance utility and Emergency Medical Services ("EMS") and ambulance services. More specifically, RCW 35.21.766 affirms the authority of the City to establish a system of ambulance service to be operated as a public utility and provides statutory guidance in setting rates. 
(Ord. 5211 Sec. 3, 2008; Ord. 2033 Sec. 1, 1977) 
9.36.020: - Service to be Provided by Fire Department. 
(1)  The purpose of the utility is to regulate users and providers of all ambulance services within the City, including: 
(a)  The monitoring and enforcement of industry standards as set forth in applicable chapters of the Revised Code of Washington (and the Washington Administrative Code); 
(b)  The establishment and management of protocols relating to emergency and non-emergency medical services originating in the City of Kennewick, inclusive of response and transport protocols;

(Ord. 5211 Sec. 4, 2008; Ord. 3953 Sec. 1, 2000; Ord. 2033 Sec. 2, 1977) 
9.36.040: - Reciprocity. 
    Emergency transport shall be provided within the cities' ambulance response and mutual aid areas to any resident of the cities of Pasco and Richland under the terms of this Section provided that the patient resides in a city that provides emergency ambulance services within its response and mutual aid areas to Kennewick residents under reciprocal terms. 
(Ord. 5076 Sec. 2, 2005; Ord. 3953 Sec. 3, 2000; Ord. 2082 Sec. 1, 1977) 
9.36.060: - Medical Services Fund. 
(1)  A Medical Services Fund has been created under KMC 3.40.173. 
(2)  The City Council determines that it is in the best interests of the City and its residents to reaffirm the creation of the utility and to name such utility the "Medical Services Fund" to regulate the provision of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and ambulance services and to address the burden on the community from demand for EMS and ambulance response and services. 
(3)  The utility will regulate the delivery of EMS and non-emergency medical and ambulance services to improve those services by requiring appropriate certifications, training, equipment, staffing, response times (for emergency medical calls), and level of care; and provide EMS and ambulance services through the Kennewick Fire Department and the EMS Program. 
(4)  Incidental to its regulatory purpose, the utility will provide a means to support the EMS Program through adequate funding generated by a service fee. 
(Ord. 5211 Sec. 5, 2008; Ord. 3953 Sec 5, 2000) 
9.36.080: - Bill for Ambulance Service. 
(1)  Each person who utilizes the ambulance service ("patient") shall be billed by the City at the rates set by Resolution. The City Manager or designee shall establish a procedure to bill and collect rates for the ambulance service. Under the procedure, the City may elect to bill the patient directly or bill the patient's insurance company, and if the patient's insurance does not cover all the cost of ambulance service, bill the remaining balance to the patient directly. The City may contract with a billing service to bill and collect the rates for the ambulance service. 
(2)  Each patient who is a City resident or is employed at and transported from a business within the City, shall be entitled to the resident charge conditioned upon: 
(a)  Patient supplies the City with all requested information and documentation including, but not limited to, insurance information and medical records relevant to billing for ambulance service;

(3)  A patient who is not a City resident and is not employed at and transported from a place of business within the City shall be subject to a surcharge on transport services at the rate set by resolution. 
(4)  All revenue received from direct billing for transport shall be allocated to offset demand costs first and then the remaining, if any, to offset availability costs. 
(Ord. 5211 Sec. 6, 2008; Ord. 3853 Sec. 7, 2000) 
9.36.085: - Utility Rate Setting. 
(1)  The City Council finds that it is in the best interests of the citizens of the City of Kennewick that the costs of the Medical Service Fund, after deducting transport charges, be divided among Kennewick residents and occupants in the form of a service fee, consistent with accepted principles of utility rate setting, based upon a calculation of demand costs and availability costs, in accordance with RCW 35.21.766. 
(2)  In accordance with RCW 35.21.766, the following cost components shall comprise the service fee: 
(a)  Availability Costs. The rates attributable to costs for availability of services shall be uniformly applied across all user classifications within the City. 
(b)  Demand Costs. The City has analyzed data on emergency medical responses and determined that demand for service and service usage varies among user classifications. Based on this analysis, the City Council finds that there are distinct differences in demands placed on the utility among classifications and that different demand costs, when applicable, are attributable to and should be accordingly apportioned among each classification. 
(3)  The City Council further finds that it is in the City's best interest that persons who do not pay the service fee but who receive service (including non-City residents and others) will be charged the full cost of service. 
(4)  Fee Formula: A monthly service fee for the operation of the utility shall be established from time-to-time by resolution of the City Council in conformity with RCW 35.21.766. The amount of the fee shall be based upon cost of regulating ambulance services and the costs of providing ambulance utility services as determined by a cost-of-service study required by RCW 35.21.766(3). Those costs, after deducting transport charges, shall be divided among the City of Kennewick residents and other occupants based on a calculation of demand costs and availability costs, consistent with accepted principles of utility rate setting including: 
(a)  The rate attributable to availability costs of the utility shall be uniformly applied across all user classifications within the utility. 
(b)  The rate attributable to demand costs, if not offset by third party billing revenues, shall be established and billed to each user classification based on each user classification's burden on the utility. 
The service fee charged by the utility shall reflect a combination of rates attributable to both the availability cost and demand cost. The resulting fees shall be assessed to identifiable user classifications. Fees shall not exceed the revenue requirements to cover the costs of the utility, as authorized by the City Council by adoption of a biennial budget and subsequent amendments. 
(5)  Classifications: The monthly service fee shall be assessed on each of the following utility user classifications: 
(a)  Residential; 
(b)  Multi-family residential; 
(c)  Adult family homes and group homes; 
(d)  Assisted living facilities; 
(e)  Twenty-four-hour nursing facilities; 
(f)  Physicians clinics; 
(g)  Schools/government agencies; and 
(h)  Commercial/Business. 
(6)  Collection of Monthly Utility Service Fee: The ambulance utility service fees shall be collected on a monthly or bi-monthly basis (as determined by KMC Chapter 14.07) from each owner of a residential dwelling unit (for "residential" classification and for "multi-family residences" to the extent that each unit is separately billed for utilities) and from the owner for classifications other than "residential" and separately billed "multi-family residential" units. The City Manager, or designee, shall be responsible for the billing and collection of the utility service fee. 
(7)  Responsibility for Utility Service Fee: The owner of the residential and multi-family residential property and all adult residents therein shall be jointly and severally responsible and liable for the utility service fee. The owner of all other classifications shall be jointly and severally responsible and liable for the utility service fee. Notice of the utility service fee shall be sent to the applicant for water and/or sewer services at the service location, unless notarized instructions from the property owner are received by the City requesting that the property owner be billed. In all other cases, the property owner shall be billed. In the event the utility service fee is included in the billing for water and/or sewer charges, any payments received shall be deemed to be first applied against the ambulance utility service fee. 
(8)  Service Fee Exemptions/Reductions: Any change in occupancy or use of a parcel, or any other change in circumstance that eliminates application of an exemption from the service fee, shall immediately make the affected property subject to applicable service fee. The service fee shall become due and payable as of the date of the change in use and shall continue until the parcel again meets exemption requirements. 
(a)  Monthly and/or bi-monthly rates shall not be prorated. Initial and final charges may be prorated in accordance with the City's standard utility proration practices. 
(b)  Any customer seeking an exemption from payment of the service fee and/or conversion from covered to exempt status, must file a written certification with the Finance Director seeking a determination as to whether a specific parcel satisfies the exemption requirements set forth in this Section. 
(c)  The combined rates charged shall reflect an exemption for persons who are Medicaid eligible and reside in a nursing facility, boarding home, adult family home, or receive in-home services. 
(d)  The combined rates charged may reflect an exemption or reduction for designated classes consistent with Article VIII, Section 7 of the State Constitution, and the amounts of any such exemption or reduction shall be a general expense of the utility, and designated as an availability cost, to be spread uniformly across the utility user classifications. 
(9)  Periodic Service Fee Review: The City Manager or designee will periodically perform financial review and analysis of the utility's revenues, expenses, indebtedness, fees and accounting, and recommend budgets, fee adjustments and financial policy. Based on such review the City Manager, or designee, shall recommend changes, amendments or additions for adoption by City Council. The total revenue generated by the rates and charges shall not exceed the total costs necessary to regulate, operate, and maintain an ambulance utility. 
(10)  Payment: The service fee shall be collected in accordance with the utility fee collection procedures as provided for in KMC Chapter 14.07. 
(Ord. 5417 Sec. 1, 2012; Ord. 5211 Sec. 10, 2008) 
9.36.100: - Compliance with Medicare and Medicaid Requirements. 
    The base rate established shall be adjusted for persons who are Medicaid eligible and who reside in a nursing facility, boarding home, adult family home, or receive in-home services. The service fees and other fees, rates, and charges for the ambulance services authorized by this Chapter shall be construed and implemented in a manner consistent with applicable Medicare and Medicaid requirements. If any method or procedures authorized by this Chapter for the purpose of establishing, implementing, imposing or collection of charges for ambulance service is found to conflict with Medicare and Medicaid requirements, the conflicting part of this Chapter shall be inoperative to the extent of the conflict and such finding or determination shall not affect the operation of the remainder of this Chapter.

CHAPTER 9.40 - INDOOR CLEAN AIR ORDINANCE 

9.40.010: - Purpose. 
    The City Council finds that exposure to secondhand smoke is known to cause cancer in humans. Secondhand smoke is a known cause of other diseases including pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease. Citizens are often exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace, and are likely to develop chronic, potentially fatal diseases as a result of such exposure. In order to protect the health and welfare of all citizens, including workers in their places of employment, it is necessary to prohibit smoking in public places and workplaces. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
9.40.020: - Definitions. 
    As used in this Chapter the following terms have the meaning indicated unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
(1)  Smoke or Smoking means the carrying or smoking of any kind of lighted pipe, cigar, cigarette, or any other lighted smoking equipment. 
(2)  Public Place means that portion of any building or vehicle used by and open to the public, regardless of whether the building or vehicle is owned in whole or in part by private persons or entities, the State of Washington, or other public entity, and regardless of whether a fee is charged for admission, and includes a presumptively reasonable minimum distance, as set forth in KMC 9.40.070, of 25 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited. A public place does not include a private residence unless the private residence is used to provide licensed child care, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care on the premises. 
Public places include, but are not limited to: Elevators, public conveyances or transportation facilities, museums, concert halls, theaters, auditoriums, exhibition halls, indoor sports arenas, hospitals, nursing homes, health care facilities or clinics, enclosed shopping centers, retail stores, retail service establishments, financial institutions, educational facilities, ticket areas, public hearing facilities, state legislative chambers and immediately adjacent hallways, public restrooms, libraries, restaurants, waiting areas, lobbies, bars, taverns, bowling alleys, skating rinks, casinos, reception areas, and no less than 75 percent of the sleeping quarters within a hotel or motel that are rented to guests. A public place does not include a private residence. This Chapter is not intended to restrict smoking in private facilities which are occasionally open to the public except upon the occasions when the facility is open to the public. 
(3)  Place of Employment means any area under the control of a public or private employer which employees are required to pass through during the course of employment, including, but not limited to: Entrances and exits to the places of employment, and including a presumptively reasonable minimum distance, as set forth in KMC 9.40.065, of 25 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited; work areas; restrooms; conference and classrooms; break rooms and cafeterias; and other common areas. A private residence or home-based business, unless used to provide licensed child care, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care on the premises, is not a place of employment. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 2, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
9.40.030: - Smoking Prohibited-Public Places. 
    No person may smoke in a public place or any place of employment. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 3, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
9.40.050: - Owner's Duties of Enforcement. 
    Owners, or in the case of a leased or rented space, the lessee or other person in charge, of a place regulated under this Chapter shall prohibit smoking in public places and places of employment and shall post signs prohibiting smoking as appropriate under this Chapter. Signs must be posted conspicuously at each building entrance. In the case of retail stores and retail service establishments, signs must be posted conspicuously at each entrance and in prominent locations throughout the place. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 4, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
9.40.060: - Private Workplaces. 
    This Chapter does not regulate smoking in private, enclosed workplaces within a public place even though it may be visited by nonsmokers, unless smoking is prohibited and posted by the fire marshal, prohibited by other law, ordinance, or regulation. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 5, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
9.40.065: - Presumptively Reasonable Distance. 
    Smoking is prohibited within a presumptively reasonable minimum distance of 25 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited so as to ensure that tobacco smoke does not enter the areas through entrances, exits, open windows, or other means. Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a public place or place of employment in the City of Kennewick may seek to rebut the presumption that 25 feet is a reasonable minimum distance by making application to the director of the Benton Franklin Health District. The presumption will be rebutted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that, given the unique circumstances presented by the location of entrances, exits, windows that open, ventilation intakes, or other factors, smoke will not infiltrate or reach the entrances, exits, open windows, or ventilation intakes or enter into such public place or place of employment and, therefore, the public health and safety will be adequately protected by a lesser distance. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 8, 2013) 
9.40.070: - Penalties. 
(1)  Any person who intentionally smokes in a public place or place of employment is guilty of an infraction and subject to a civil penalty of up to $100.00.

(3)  The fire marshal will enforce Section 9.40.050. 
(Ord. 5511 Sec. 6, 2013; Ord. 2940 Sec. 1(part), 1985) 
CHAPTER 9.44 - REGULATING UNFIT AND SUBSTANDARD STRUCTURES 

9.44.010: - Purpose and Findings. 
    The City Council of the City of Kennewick finds that unkempt, unsafe, unsanitary and otherwise improperly maintained premises and structures, sidewalks and easements within the City of Kennewick, in addition to the obvious hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety and welfare, adversely affect the value, utility and habitability of property within the City as a whole and specifically cause substantial damage to adjoining and nearby property. A property which is merely unkempt, may reduce the value of adjoining property by more than 30 percent, and there are sufficient properties which are unkempt, unsightly and dangerous, that the habitability and economic well-being of the City are materially and adversely affected. This Chapter conveys to the City administration, in accord with the procedures set out below, all necessary and proper powers to abate nuisances as they are described or found to exist and to charge the costs of their abatement to those responsible, the owners and occupants of the property upon which nuisances exist, and those properties themselves. This Chapter is an exercise of the City's police power, and it shall be liberally construed to effect this purpose.

10.01.120: - General Requirements of Culpability. 
(1)  Kinds of Culpability Defined. 
(a)  Intent. A person acts with intent or intentionally when he acts with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result which constitutes a crime. 
(b)  Knowledge. A person knows or acts knowingly or with knowledge when: 
(i)  He is aware of a fact, facts, or circumstances or result described by a statute defining an offense; or 
(ii)  He has information which would lead a reasonable man in the same situation to believe that facts exist, which facts are described by a statute defining an offense. 
(c)  Recklessness. A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable man would exercise in the same situation. 
(d)  Criminal Negligence. A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when he fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable man would exercise in the same situation. 
(2)  Substitutes for Criminal Negligence, Recklessness, and Knowledge. When a statute provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly. When acting suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally. 
(3)  Culpability as Determinant Grade of Offense. When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense. 
(4)  Requirement of Willfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed willfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements plainly appears. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.130: - Liability for Conduct of Another-Complicity. 
(1)  A person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable. 
(2)  A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when: 
(a)  Acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the crime, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; or 
(b)  He is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by this Title or by the law defining the crime; or 
(c)  He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the crime. 
(3)  A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if: 
(a)  With knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he: 
(i)  Solicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or 
(ii)  Aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or 
(b)  His conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity. 
(4)  A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular crime himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing his incapacity. 
(5)  Unless otherwise provided by this Title or by the law defining the crime, a person is not an accomplice in a crime committed by another person if; 
(a)  He is a victim of that crime; or 
(b)  He terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the crime, and either gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes a good faith effort to prevent the commission of the crime. 
(6)  A person legally accountable for the conduct of another person may be convicted on proof of the commission of the crime and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the crime has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different crime or degree of crime or has an immunity to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979)

(c)  "High Managerial Agent" means an officer or director of a corporation or any other agent in a position of comparable authority with respect to the formulation of corporate policy or the supervision in a managerial capacity of subordinate employees. 
(2)  A corporation is guilty of an offense when: 
(a)  The conduct constituting the offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty of performance imposed on corporations by law; or 
(b)  The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded, or tolerated by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting within the scope of his employment and on behalf of the corporation; or 
(c)  The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in by an agent of the corporation, other than a high managerial agent, while acting within the scope of his employment and in behalf of the corporation and: 
(i)  The offense is a gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor; or 
(ii)  The offense is one defined by a statute which clearly indicates a legislative intent to impose such criminal liability on a corporation. 
(3)  A person is criminally liable for conduct constituting an offense which he performs or causes to be performed in the name of or on behalf of a corporation to the same extent as if such conduct were performed in his own name or behalf. 
(4)  Whenever a duty to act is imposed by law upon a corporation, any agent of the corporation who knows he has or shares primary responsibility for the discharge of the duty is criminally liable for a reckless or, if a high managerial agent, criminally negligent omission to perform the required act to the same extent as if the duty were by law imposed directly upon such agent. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.150: - Insanity. 
    To establish the defense of insanity, it must be shown that:

(a)  He was unable to perceive the nature and quality of the act with which he is charged; or 
(b)  He was unable to tell right from wrong with reference to the particular act charged. 
(2)  The defense of insanity must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.160: - Definition of Necessary. 
    In Sections 10.01.170 through 10.01.210, unless a different meaning is plainly required: 
    Necessary means that no reasonably effective alternative to the use of force appeared to exist and that the amount of force used was reasonable to effect the lawful purpose intended. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.170: - Use of Force-When Lawful. 
    The use, attempt, or offer to use force upon or toward the person of another shall not be unlawful in the following cases: 
(1)  Whenever necessarily used by a public officer in the performance of legal duty, or a person assisting him and acting under his direction; 
(2)  Whenever necessarily used by a person arresting one who has committed a felony and delivering him to a public officer competent to receive him into custody; 
(3)  Whenever used by a party about to be injured, or by another lawfully aiding him, in preventing or attempting to prevent an offense against his person, or a malicious trespass, or other malicious interference with real or personal property lawfully in his possession, in case the force is not more than shall be necessary; 
(4)  Whenever reasonably used by a person to detain someone who enters or remains unlawfully in a building or on real property lawfully in the possession of such person, so long as such detention is reasonable in duration and manner to investigate the reason for the detained person's presence on the premises, and so long as the premises in question did not reasonably appear to be intended to be open to members of the public; 
(5)  Whenever used in a reasonable and moderate manner by a parent, teacher or guardian for the purpose of restraining or correcting the child. Any use of force not otherwise lawful on a child by any other person is unlawful unless it is reasonable and moderate and is authorized in advance by the child's parent or guardian for the purpose of restraining or correcting the child. It is presumptively unreasonable to restrain or correct a child by throwing, kicking, burning or cutting him; striking him with a closed fist; shaking him if he is under the age of three; interfering with his breathing; threatening him with a deadly weapon; or doing any other act likely to cause and which does cause bodily harm greater than transient pain or minor temporary marks; 
(6)  Whenever used by a carrier of passengers or his authorized agent or servant, or other person assisting them at their request in expelling from a carriage, railway car, vessel, or other vehicle, a passenger who refuses to obey a lawful and reasonable regulation prescribed for the conduct of passengers, if such vehicle has first been stopped and the force used is not more than shall be necessary to expel the offender with reasonable regard to his personal safety; 
(7)  Whenever used by any person to prevent a mentally retarded person or a mentally ill person from committing an act dangerous to himself or another, or in enforcing necessary restraint for the protection of his person, or his restoration to health, during such period only as shall be necessary to obtain legal authority for the restraint or custody of his person. 
(Ord. 5335 Sec. 1, 2011; Ord. 2641 Sec. 2, 1981; Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.180: - Duress. 
(1)  In any prosecution for a crime, it is a defense that: 
(a)  The actor participated in the crime under compulsion by another who by threat or use of force created an apprehension in the mind of the actor that in case of refusal he or another would be liable to immediate death or immediate grievous bodily injury; and 
(b)  That such apprehension was reasonable upon the part of the actor; and 
(c)  That the actor would not have participated in the crime except for the duress involved. 
(2)  The defense of duress is not available if the crime charged is murder, manslaughter, or homicide by abuse. 
(3)  The defense of duress is not available if the actor intentionally or recklessly places himself in a situation in which it is probable that he will be subject to duress. 
(4)  The defense of duress is not established solely by a showing that a married person acted on the command of his or her spouse. 
(Ord. 5057 Sec. 2, 2004; Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.190: - Entrapment. 
(1)  In any prosecution for a crime, it is a defense that: 
(a)  The criminal design originated in the mind of law enforcement officials, or any person acting under their direction; and 
(b)  The actor was lured or induced to commit a crime which the actor had not otherwise intended to commit. 
(2)  The defense of entrapment is not established by a showing only that the law enforcement officials merely afforded the actor an opportunity to commit a crime. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.200: - Action for Being Detained on Mercantile Establishment Premises for Investigation-"Reasonable Grounds" as Defense. 
    In any criminal action brought by reason of any person having been detained on or in the immediate vicinity of the premises of a mercantile establishment for the purpose of investigation or questioning as to the ownership of any merchandise, it shall be a defense of such action that the person was detained in a reasonable manner and for not more than a reasonable time to permit such investigation or questioning by a peace officer, by the owner of the mercantile establishment, or by the owner's authorized employee or agent, and that such peace officer, owner, employee, or agent had reasonable grounds to believe that the person so detained was committing or attempting to commit theft or shoplifting on such premises of such merchandise. As used in this Section, "reasonable grounds" shall include, but not be limited to, knowledge that a person has concealed possession of unpurchased merchandise of a mercantile establishment, and a "reasonable time" shall mean the time necessary to permit the statement, and the time necessary to examine employees and records of the mercantile establishment relative to the ownership of the merchandise. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.202: - Arrest Without a Warrant-When Authorized. 
    A police officer having probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing a felony shall have the authority to arrest the person without a warrant. A police officer may arrest a person without a warrant for committing a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor only when the offense is committed in the presence of the officer, except as provided below.

(2)  A police officer shall arrest and take into custody, pending release on bail, personal recognizance, or court order, a person without a warrant when the officer has probable cause to believe that: 
(a)  An order has been issued of which the person has knowledge under RCW 10.99, 26.09, 26.10, 26.44.063, 26.26, 26.50, or 74.34 restraining the person and the person has violated the terms of the order restraining the person from acts or threats of violence or excluding the person from a residence or, in the case of an order issued under RCW 26.44.063, imposing any other restrictions or conditions upon the person; or 
(b)  The person is 18 years or older and within the preceding four hours has assaulted that person's spouse, former spouse, or a person 18 years or older with whom the person resides or has formerly resided and the officer believes:

(ii)  An assault has occurred which has resulted in bodily injury to the victim, whether the injury is observable by the responding officer or not; or 
(iii)  That any physical action has occurred which was intended to cause another person reasonably to fear imminent serious bodily injury or death. Bodily injury means physical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition. 
When the officer has probable cause to believe that spouses, former spouses, or other persons who reside together or formerly resided together have assaulted each other, the officer is not required to arrest both persons. The officer shall arrest the person whom the officer believes to be the primary physical aggressor. In making this determination, the officer shall make every reasonable effort to consider: 
1)  The intent to protect victims of domestic violence under RCW 10.99.010; 
2)  The comparative extent of injuries inflicted or serious threats creating fear of physical injury; and 
3)  The history of domestic violence between the persons involved. 
(3)  Any police officer having probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing a violation of any of the following traffic laws shall have the authority to arrest the person:

(5)  Any police officer having probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing a violation of RCW 88.12.025 shall have the authority to arrest the person. 
(6)  An officer may act upon the request of a law enforcement officer in whose presence a traffic infraction was committed, to stop, detain, arrest, or issue a notice of traffic infraction to the driver who is believed to have committed the infraction. The request by the witnessing officer shall give an officer the authority to take appropriate action under the laws of the State.

(11)  Except as specifically provided in subsections (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this Section, nothing in this Section extends or otherwise affects the powers of arrest prescribed in Title 46 RCW. 
(12)  No police officer may be held criminally or civilly liable for making an arrest pursuant to RCW 10.31.100(2) or (8) if the police officer acts in good faith and without malice. 
(Ord. 5057 Sec. 3, 2004; Ord. 3641 Sec. 1, 1995; Ord. 3473 Sec. 1, 1993; Ord. 3159 Sec. 1, 1988; Ord. 3112 Sec. 1, 1987; Ord. 3107 Sec. 1, 1987; Ord. 2914 Sec. 1, 1985; Ord. 2655 Sec. 3(part), 1982) 
10.01.204: - Stopping and Detaining-When Authorized. 
(1)  A police officer may stop and detain a person under the following circumstances: 
(a)  When he has probable cause to believe that the person he is stopping and detaining has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime or other violation of law, ordinance or regulation; 
(b)  When he has a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific, articulable facts known to him at the time, that the individual has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime; 
(c)  When he has a reasonable cause to believe that the person he is stopping and detaining is wanted and there is a warrant outstanding for his arrest; and 
(d)  When he has a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific, articulable facts that the person he is stopping and detaining has information concerning a crime or has information concerning any person involved in a crime. 
(2)  In the event that a police officer stops and detains a person, he shall, in all cases, have the right to take any reasonable precautions to ensure his own safety or the safety of others. 
(3)  Should the person detained refuse to cooperate with the police officer, except for taking steps necessary to ensure his or the safety of others, the officer must, before proceeding further, inform the detainee of his authority, if he is not in uniform and has not already done so; the reason he is being detained; and the reason the officer desires the information. If the detainee is suspected of having committed, committing or being about to commit a crime, the officer will inform him of his right to remain silent. 
(4)  The continued detention or ultimate arrest of a detainee shall not continue longer than is reasonably necessary under the circumstances. 
(a)  If a person is detained because the officer believes he is wanted, the detention shall continue no longer than reasonably necessary to determine his identity and make inquiry into the records of local police agencies, the Washington Crime Information Center, the National Crime Information Center or other source where the officer reasonably believes information of the detainee's status will be found. 
(i)  If the detainee has an outstanding warrant issued by a court of the State of Washington, the officer will arrest the person and either allow him to post bail, if authorized, or notify the jurisdiction which issued the warrant and request that they take the arrestee into custody. If the issuing jurisdiction fails or refuses to accept custody of the arrestee within a reasonable time, he shall be released. 
(ii)  If the officer learns that the detainee stands charged in the courts of another state with a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, he shall arrest him and take him before a judge or magistrate not later than the next judicial day and make complaint against him, under oath, setting forth the grounds for the arrest. The officer shall also notify the prosecuting attorney, as soon as practical, following the arrest. 
(b)  If the detainee is sought as a witness in a criminal case which is set for trial or is under investigation by a grand jury, the police officer may detain him long enough to consult with the prosecutor or defense counsel, as the case may be, to determine whether he should be required to appear before a magistrate or judge to ensure his appearance or testimony. Should the prosecutor or defense counsel determine that the detainee's testimony is material and should it appear that he might not appear in response to a subpoena, he may, not later than the next judicial day, be brought before a judge or magistrate. 
(c)  If the person is detained because there is a reasonable suspicion that he has committed, was committing or is about to commit a crime, the officer may continue the detention as long as necessary and reasonable in light of the circumstances. 
(d)  If a detainee is sought because he has information concerning a crime or persons involved in a crime, the officer, after having informed him of his office and purpose, may continue the detention for a reasonable period of time in order to obtain the desired information. 
(i)  If the person detained as a material witness, states that he does not have the information desired, he shall be released; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude his being charged with a criminal violation in the event his answer is false. 
(ii)  If the person detained as a material witness refuses to give information and the police officer has probable cause to believe that the detainee is a material witness, the officer may continue his detention not longer than the next judicial day and bring him before a judge or magistrate. If the judge or magistrate determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the person detained has information concerning a crime or the whereabouts of a person who has committed a crime, that the information is material, that the information is not privileged and that the information is reasonably necessary in the interests of justice, the court may continue the detention until such time as the detainee gives the information; or the court may recognize him on such terms and conditions as appear just and equitable. The further detention of a person shall not continue beyond the time he has given such information or stated under oath that he does not have such information. 
(Ord. 2655 Sec. 3(part), 1982) 
10.01.206: - Citation and Notice to Appear or Arrest-Considerations. 
    Whenever a person is arrested, except in the case of a felony, the arresting officer will normally issue a citation and notice to appear, but in considering whether he should issue such a citation and notice to appear or continue the custody of the person arrested, the officer shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  Whether the person has identified himself satisfactorily; 
(2)  Whether the detention appears reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself or another, injury to property, or breach of the peace; 
(3)  Whether the person has ties to the community reasonably sufficient to assure his appearance or whether there is substantial likelihood that he will refuse to respond to the citation; and 
(4)  Whether the person previously has failed to appear in response to a citation or other lawful process. 
(Ord. 2655 Sec. 3(part), 1982) 
10.01.210: - Intoxication. 
    No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication shall be deemed less criminal by reason of his condition, but whenever the actual existence of any particular mental state is a necessary element to constitute a particular species or degree of crime, the fact of his intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining such mental state. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.230: - Criminal Attempt. 
(1)  A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with intent to commit a specific crime, he does an act which is a substantial step toward the commission of that crime. 
(2)  If the conduct in which a person engages otherwise constitutes an attempt to commit a crime, it is no defense to a prosecution for such attempt that the crime charged to have been attempted was, under the attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission. 
(3)  An attempt to commit a crime is a: 
(a)  Gross misdemeanor when the crime attempted is a Class C felony; 
(b)  Misdemeanor when the crime attempted is a gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor. 
(Ord. 5057 Sec. 4, 2004; Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979)

(1)  A person is guilty of criminal solicitation when, with intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a crime, he offers to give or gives money or other thing of value to another to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such crime or which would establish complicity of such other person in its commission or attempted commission had such crime been attempted or committed. 
(2)  Criminal solicitation shall be punished in the same manner as criminal attempt in Section 10.01.230. 
(Ord. 2385 Sec. 1(part), 1979) 
10.01.250: - Criminal Conspiracy. 
(1)  A person is guilty of criminal conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them takes a substantial step in pursuance of such agreement. 
(2)  It shall not be a defense to criminal conspiracy that the person or persons with whom the accused is alleged to have conspired: 
(a)  Has not been prosecuted or convicted; or 
(b)  Has been convicted of a different offense; or 
(c)  Is not amenable to justice; or 
(d)  Has been acquitted; or 
(e)  Lacked the capacity to commit an offense. 
(3)  Criminal conspiracy is a: 
(a)  Gross misdemeanor when the object of the conspiratorial agreement is a Class C felony;

No property may be forfeited under this Section until after there has been a superior court conviction of the owner of the property for the felony in connection with which the property was employed, furnished, or acquired. 
A forfeiture of property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if at the time the security interest was created, the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the commission of the felony. 
(2)  Personal property subject to forfeiture under this Chapter may be seized by the Kennewick Police Department upon process issued by any superior court having jurisdiction over the property. Seizure of personal property without process may be made if:

(c)  A law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the property is directly dangerous to health or safety; or

The Police Department shall cause notice to be served within 15 days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. The notice of seizure may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including, but not limited to, service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail shall be deemed complete upon mailing within the 15-day period following the seizure. Notice of seizure in the case of property subject to a security interest that has been perfected by filing a financing statement in accordance with Chapter 62A.9 RCW, or a certificate of title shall be made by service upon the secured party or the secured party's assignee at the address shown on the financing statement or the certificate of title. 
(4)  If no person notifies the Police Department in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of items specified in subsection (1) of this Section within 45 days of the seizure, the item seized shall be deemed forfeited. 
(5)  If a person notifies the Police Department in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of the seized property within 45 days of the seizure, the Department shall give the person or persons a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The hearing shall be before the Chief of Police or his designee, except that any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction. Removal may only be accomplished according to the rules of civil procedure. The person seeking removal of the matter must serve process on the City and any other party of interest, in accordance with RCW 4.28.080 or 4.92.020, within 45 days after the person seeking removal has notified the Police Department of his ownership or right to possession. The court to which the matter is to be removed shall be the district court when the aggregate value of the property is within the jurisdictional limit set forth in RCW 3.66.020. Any appeal from the hearing before the Chief of Police or his designee shall be to the Benton County Superior Court in accord with Title 34 RCW. In a court hearing between two or more claimants to the property involved, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The burden of producing evidence shall be upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the property. The Department shall promptly return the property to the claimant upon a determination by the Chief or a court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession of the property. 
(6)  When property is forfeited under this Chapter, after satisfying any court-ordered victim restitution, the Police Department may: 
(a)  Retain it for official use or upon application by another law enforcement agency release such property to such agency for the exclusive use of enforcing the criminal law; 
(b)  Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public. 
(7)  By January 31 of each year, the City Treasurer shall remit to the state treasurer an amount equal to ten percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year. Money remitted shall be deposited in the public safety and education account. 
(a)  The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to independent selling agents. 
(b)  The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure, determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index, such as the index used by the department of licensing for valuation of motor vehicles. The Police Department may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero. 
(c)  Retained property and net proceeds not required to be paid to the state treasurer, or otherwise required to be spent under this Section, shall be retained by the Police Department exclusively for the expansion and improvement of law enforcement activity. Money retained under this Section may not be used to supplant preexisting funding sources.

CHAPTER 13.16 - TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEES 

13.16.010: - Title. 
    This code shall be hereinafter known as the City of Kennewick Transportation Impact Fee (TIF). 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.020: - Purpose and Intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this chapter is for the collection of impact fees for streets and roads, and providing for certain other matters in connection therewith. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.030: - Findings and Authority. 
    The City Council of the City of Kennewick hereby finds and determines that development activities, including, but not limited to, new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development in the City of Kennewick will create additional demand and need for public facilities in the City, and the Council finds that such new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of new facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The City of Kennewick has conducted research and analysis documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on public facilities, has prepared the "2040 Transportation System Plan (TSP)". The TSP utilizes a methodology for calculating impact fees that fulfills all of the requirements of RCW 82.02.060(1). The City of Kennewick has prepared a Fee Schedule based upon Council approved rates per new P.M. Peak Hour Trip. The TSP and Fee Schedule are incorporated into this title by this reference. A copy of the TSP and the Fee Schedule shall be kept on file with the Public Works Department and on the Public Works Department website, and is available to the public for review. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the Council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for streets and roads. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the Council in establishing the impact fee program.

    The transportation impact fee rates are generated from the formula for calculating impact fees set forth in the Fee Schedule, which is on file with the Public Works Department. Except as otherwise provided for in independent fee calculations in KMC 13.16.070, exemptions in KMC 13.16.080, and credits in KMC 13.16.090, all new development activity in the City will be charged the transportation impact fee applicable to the type of development and the District in which the development occurs, as set forth in the current Transportation Impact Fee Schedule as adopted by Council. 
( Ord. 5759 Sec. 3, 2018 ; Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.060: - Assessment of Impact Fees. 
(1)  The City shall collect impact fees, based on the land use categories and rates on the current Fee Schedule, from any applicant seeking development permits from the City where such development activity requires the issuance of a building permit or approval for a change in use, except for development exempt under KMC 13.16.080. This shall include, but is not limited to, the development of residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial land, and includes the expansion of existing uses that creates a demand for additional system improvements as well as a change in existing use that creates a demand for additional system improvements. The public works department is authorized to determine the appropriate land use category found in the Fee Schedule that applies to the application. A separate Fee Schedule exists for each District, and the impact fee shall be assessed based on the District in which the development occurs. 
(2)  All impact fees shall be due and payable prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy based on the land use categories on the Fee Schedule. Prior to issuance of a single-family residential building permit, the applicant may elect to defer payment of the impact fee to the time of closing of sale of the unit. If this option is selected, the City shall record a covenant against the property for the payment of the impact fee in effect at time of application for deferral. Any fees associated with filing/recording the covenant, shall be paid by applicant. Unless the use of an independent fee calculation has been approved, or unless a development agreement entered into pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 provided otherwise, the fee shall be calculated based on the impact Fee Schedule in effect at the time a completed building permit application is filed. The term of the impact fee deferral for a single-family residential unit may not exceed 18 months from the date of building permit issuance. For a change in use for which no building permit is required, the fee shall be calculated based on the impact fee schedule in effect on the date of payment of the impact fee. 
(3)  The public works department shall establish the transportation impact fee rate for a land use that is not listed in the fee schedule. The applicant shall submit all information requested by the City for purposes of determining the impact fee rate pursuant to KMC 13.16.070. 
(4)  For a change in use of an existing building or dwelling unit, including any alteration, expansion, replacement or new accessory building that generate additional trips, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less any impact fee previously paid for the land use category of the prior use. If no impact fee was paid for the prior use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate of the current use. 
(5)  For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed for the proportionate share of each land use based on the applicable measurement in the transportation impact fee rates set forth in the Fee Schedule. 
(6)  The Community Planning Department shall not issue the required certificate of occupancy until the transportation impact fees set forth in the Fee Schedule have been paid as set forth in the Fee Schedule or in the amounts that they exceed any credits allowable under this chapter. For a change in use where a building permit is not required, the applicant shall not occupy or permit a tenant to occupy the subject property unless and until the impact fee has been paid. 
( Ord. 5759 Sec. 4, 2018 ; Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.070: - Independent Fee Calculations. 
(1)  If in the judgment of the Director, none of the fee categories or fee amounts set forth in foregoing section of this title accurately describes or captures the impacts of a new development on roads, the department may conduct independent fee calculations and the Director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations. 
(2)  The applicant may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee structure in the transportation impact Fee Schedule listed in the City Fee Schedule, in which case the applicant shall prepare and submit to the Director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a development permit is being sought. The documentation submitted shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer with documentable experience in traffic engineering and shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made using procedures consistent with those established in the current edition of the Trip Generation Handbook, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. An independent fee calculation shall use the same methodology used to establish impact fees set forth in the transportation impact Fee Schedule, shall be limited to adjustments in trip generation rates used in the Fee Schedule, and shall not include travel demand forecasts, trip distribution, transportation service areas, costs of road projects, or cost allocation procedures. 
(3)  The applicant submitting an independent fee calculation will be required to pay the City of Kennewick a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the independent fee calculation. The fee required by the City for conducting the review of the independent fee calculation shall be charged based on the following: 
(a)  For developments generating less than 30 new p.m. peak hour trips per the Fee Schedule, the cost will be $200.00. 
(b)  For developments generating between 30 and 200 new p.m. peak hour trips per the Fee Schedule, the cost will be $400.00. 
(c)  For developments generating more than 200 new p.m. peak hour trips per the Fee Schedule, the cost will be $600.00. 
(4)  There is a rebuttable presumption that the calculations set forth in Fee Schedule are valid. The Director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation or analysis which the Director reasonably deems to be inapplicable, inaccurate or not reliable. The Director may require the applicant to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The Director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. 
(5)  Determinations made by the Director pursuant to this section may be appealed as set forth in KMC 13.16.170. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.080: - Exemptions. 
(1)  Except as provided for below, the following shall be exempted from the payment of transportation impact fees: 
(a)  Alteration or replacement of an existing nonresidential structure that does not expand the usable space, add any residential units or generate any additional p.m. peak hour trips. 
(b)  Miscellaneous improvements which do not generate increased p.m. peak hour trips, including, but not limited to, fences, walls, residential swimming pools, and signs. 
(c)  Demolition or moving of a structure when additional p.m. peak hour trips are not generated. 
(d)  A change of use that does not generate one or more p.m. peak hour trips. 
(e)  Miscellaneous permits such as Electrical, Fire Protection System, Mechanical, Plumbing, Right-of-way use, Shoreline and sign permits which do not generate any new p.m. peak hour trips. 
(f)  Rezones, Comprehensive Plan Amendments, Land surface modifications, Commercial subdivisions, Boundary line adjustment and Lot line eliminations, which does not generate any new p.m. peak hour trips. 
(g)  Structures constructed by regional transit authority as define in RCW 82.02.09. 
(h)  Any development permit application that has been submitted to the City before 5:00 p.m. the business day before the effective date of this chapter and subsequently determined to be a complete land use application, based on the information on file as of the effective date of this chapter. 
(2)  The Director shall be authorized to determine whether a particular development activity falls within an exemption identified in this KMC 13.16.080 or under other applicable law. Determinations of the Director shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in KMC 13.16.170. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.090: - Credits. 
(1)  An applicant may request that a credit or credits for impact fees be awarded to him/her for the total value of system improvements, including dedications of land, improvements and/or construction provided by the applicant. Credits will be given only if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are for one or more of the transportation projects listed in the Rate Study as the basis for calculating the impact fee. 
(2)  The Director shall determine if requests for credits meet the criteria in subsection (1) above or under other applicable law. Determinations of the Director shall be subject to the appeals procedure set forth in KMC 13.16.170. 
(3)  Each request for a credit or credits shall include a legal description of the dedicated land, a detailed description of improvements or construction provided, and a legal description or other adequate description of the development to which the credit will be applied. 
(4)  For each request for a credit or credits, the Director shall determine the value of the dedicated land, improvements, or construction on a case-by-case basis. In the event that the applicant disagrees with the Director's valuation, the applicant may submit an appraisal for the Director's consideration, prepared by a state certified MAI (Member of the American Institute of Appraisers) or licensed professional engineer and be licensed in good standing pursuant to RCW 18.40 et seq., in the category for the property to be appraised, and shall not have a fiduciary or personal interest in the property being appraised. 
(5)  The appraiser and/or licensed engineer shall be directed to determine the fair market value of the total value of the dedicated land, improvements, and/or construction provided by the applicant. The applicant shall pay for the actual costs for the appraisal. 
(6)  After receiving and reviewing the appraisal, the Director will determine the dollar amount of any credit, the basis for the credit, the legal description of the real property dedicated where applicable, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied with issuance of the building permit. If the total value of any such dedication, improvement or construction cost exceeds the amount of the impact fee obligation, the developer will not be entitled to reimbursement of the difference. 
(7)  No credit shall be given for project improvements or right-of-way dedications for direct access improvements to and/or within the subject development above and beyond what is proposed in the capital facilities plan. 
(8)  Any claim for credit must be made before payment of the impact fee and prior to the issuance of the building permit or a permit for a change in use. The failure to timely file such a claim shall constitute a final bar to later request any such credit. 
(9)  Determinations made by the Director pursuant to this chapter shall be subjected to the appeals procedures set forth in KMC 13.16.170. 
(10)  No impact fee for a specific development shall be increased or decreased once said fee has been paid. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.100: - Adjustments. 
    Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the Rate Study has provided adjustments for future taxes to be paid by the development activity which are earmarked or pro-ratable to the same new public facilities which will serve the new development. The transportation impact fee rates in the Fee Schedule have been reasonably adjusted for taxes and other revenue sources which are anticipated to be available to fund public improvements. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.110: - Establishment of Impact Fee Account. 
(1)  Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and deposited in a special interest-bearing account. 
(2)  The City shall establish a separate impact fee account by District, for the fees collected pursuant to this chapter entitled Transportation Impact Fee Account. Funds withdrawn from the account must be used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable state law. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected. 
(3)  On an annual basis, the Finance Director shall provide a report to the Council on the transportation impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the public improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within ten years of receipt, unless the Council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reasons for the City to hold the fees beyond the ten-year period. Under such circumstances, the Council shall establish the period of time within which the impact fees shall be expended or encumbered. 
(4)  Impact fees shall be collected and accounted for in the District in which development occurs. 
( Ord. 5759 Sec. 5, 2018 ; Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.120: - Authorization for Interlocal Agreement. 
    The City Manager is authorized to execute, on behalf of the city, an interlocal agreement with other agencies having authority over transportation facilities to identify impacts and provide mitigation for those impacts. In no case shall mitigation payments to the city be reduced to account for mitigation payments to other jurisdictions. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.130: - Administrative Guidelines. 
    The Public Works Director is hereby authorized to adopt internal guidelines for the administration of transportation impact fees, which may include the adoption of a procedures guide for transportation impact fees.

13.16.140: - Refunds. 
(1)  If the City fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within ten years of when the fees were paid, or where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to 13.16.110, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis. 
(2)  The City shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimants must be the owner of record of the real property against which the impact fee was assessed.

(5)  Refunds of impact fees or offsets against subsequent impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the City. 
(6)  When the City seeks to terminate any or all components of the impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the City shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year after the second publication. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the City, but must be expended for the appropriate public facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated. 
(7)  The City shall also refund to the current owner of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, however, that, if the City has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the Director can decline to provide the refund. If within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner can petition the Director for an offset in the amount of the fee originally paid and not refunded. The petitioner must provide receipts of impact fees previously paid for a development activity of the same or substantially similar nature on the same real property or some portion thereof. The Director shall determine whether to grant an offset, and the determinations of the Director may be appealed pursuant to the procedure in Section 13.16.170.

(3)  Transportation impact fees may also be used to recoup system improvement costs previously incurred by the City to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs. 
(4)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of public improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. 
(5)  Impact fees shall be spent on TIF-eligible projects at the rate established in the 2040 Transportation System Plan project list, and shall be spent in the District in which the fees were collected, except for cross-over traffic between Districts as noted in the TSP, and at the discretion of the Public Works Director.

13.16.160: - Periodic Adjustment of Rates. 
(1)  The transportation impact fee in the Fee Schedule will be amended to reflect changes to the 20-year transportation project list as part of adoption of amendments to the capital facilities element of the City's Comprehensive Plan. Amendment to the schedule for this purpose shall be adopted by the council. 
(2)  The transportation impact fee in the Fee Schedule shall be indexed to provide for an automatic fee increase each January 1 beginning in the year 2019. A three-year rolling average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), U.S. City Average, for the year ending October 31 each year will be used to determine the increase in fees for each following year to reflect increased project costs. 
(3)  A new rate study, which established the transportation impact fee in the Fee Schedule, shall be updated every five years, unless the city determines that circumstances have not changed to warrant an update. 
( Ord. 5759 Sec. 7, 2018 ; Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.170: - Review by Director and Appeals. 
(1)  The applicant may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest so that the Certificate of Occupancy, or a change in use when no building permit is required, can be issued. No appeal shall be permitted until the impact fees at issue have been paid. 
(2)  Requests for review regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may be filed only by the applicant for the development activity at issue. 
(3)  The applicant must first file a request for review regarding impact fees with the Director, as provided herein: 
(a)  The request shall be in writing on the form provided by the City; 
(b)  The request for review by the Director shall be filed within 14 calendar days after the applicant's payment of the impact fee at issue; 
(c)  The failure to timely file such a request shall constitute a final bar to later seek such review; 
(d)  No administrative fee will be imposed for the request for review by the Director; 
(e)  The Director shall issue his/her determination in writing. 
(4)  Determinations of the Director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the Director's decision concerning the independent fee calculation which is authorized in Section 13.16.070, or any other determination which the Director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, may be appealed by the applicant or owner to the Hearing Examiner per KMC 4.02. The appeal, in the form of a letter of appeal, must be delivered to the Community Planning Department within 14 calendar days after issuance of the decision of the Director. The failure to timely file an appeal shall constitute a final bar to later seek such review. In those cases where the proposed development activity may require a public hearing under the authority of other chapters of this code, the hearings may be combined. For example, if the underlying development permit application is a preliminary plat, the appeal shall be heard at the preliminary plat public hearing. The Hearing Examiner may conduct an open record appeal hearing. The Hearing Examiner only determines whether the fee is reasonable, but does not make adjustment thereto. The Hearing Examiner may remand the matter to the Public Works Director for further consideration consistent with the Hearing Examiner's findings and decision. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.180: - Existing Authority Unimpaired. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the City from requiring the applicant or the proponent of a development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; so long as the exercise of such authority is consistent with the provisions of Chapter 43.21C RCW and Chapter 82.02 RCW. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.190: - Relationship to State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). 
(1)  All development shall be subject to the environmental review pursuant to SEPA and other applicable city ordinances and regulations. 
(2)  Further mitigation in addition to the impact fee shall be required for identified adverse impacts appropriate for mitigation pursuant to SEPA that are not mitigated by an impact fee program. 
(Ord. 5596 Sec. 3, 2015) 
13.16.200: - Relationship to Concurrency Management. 
    Neither compliance with this chapter, or the payment of any fee hereunder, shall constitute a determination of transportation concurrency under this chapter.

(c)  Prepare a Water Shortage Emergency status report that includes a request for a voluntary water use reduction of 15 percent to 25 percent below current usage and distribute to all large water users identified in the City's water utility billing system. The intent of this process is to approach large water users separately from the general/lower volume water users with a written status report providing technical information on their specific water usage supporting the request for voluntary reduction. 
(d)  Utilize media sources to communicate the Water Shortage Emergency as deemed necessary. 
(e)  Establish a Water Shortage Emergency "hotline" to address public questions, comments and concerns. 
(f)  Establish an information source point entitled "Water Shortage Emergency" on the City's official website which provides updated information on water shortage emergency stages, conditions, and requirements.

(b)  Implement mandatory landscape watering restrictions that include adherence to specific watering schedules up to and including prohibition of landscape watering altogether if necessary. 
(c)  Prohibit the operation and introduction of water into an ornamental fountain.

(i)  Require operators of hotels, motels, and other commercial lodging establishments to conspicuously post a "Water Shortage Emergency" notice as approved by the Municipal Services Department Executive Director or Public Works Director. 
(3)  Grievous Stage-In addition to the following measures, all measures identified in the previous temperate and intermediate stages shall apply. The Municipal Services Department shall: 
(a)  Prohibit all watering of any lawn, yard, City-owned park, landscaping, recreational area or any other area containing vegetation. 
(b)  Rescind all fire hydrant meter use permits and issue no new permits. 
(c)  Close all City-owned swimming pools, wading pools, splash facilities, and the like. 
(4)  Should the above measures fall short of maintaining enough water supply for the basic functions of health and sanitation, the Municipal Services Department Executive Director or Public Works Director is authorized to:

For Temperate Stage conditions such notice shall be published at least two days in the official newspaper of the City, and shall contain a description of the programs, the effective date and time of implementation, and penalty for violation. For Intermediate Stage conditions such notice shall be published for at least one day. For Grievous Stage conditions notification shall be by the most expedient means possible with a follow-up published notification if the Grievous Stage condition is expected to last more than three consecutive days. Assistance of other local media will be sought throughout the duration of the water shortage in an attempt to further advise water customers; however, such additional media assistance shall not be deemed a condition precedent to effectuating the program on the date and time specified in the notice of cessation published as required in this section. 
(6)  Notice of cessation of the water shortage shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the City; provided, however, that notice of cessation need only be published one time. 
(Ord. 5125 Sec.3, 2006; Ord. 2481 Sec. 2(part), 1980)

(a)  The Director may change or modify the application and designate the manner and place where the side sewer shall connect to the public sewer system, may specify the material, size and grade of the side sewer, and may determine whether or not the order shall be granted. The Director may require the applicant to furnish plans prepared and stamped by a professional engineer, licensed in this state. 
(b)  If, in the opinion of the Director, physical conditions make compliance with the provisions of this chapter and Chapters 14.24 and 14.28 impracticable, the Director may issue a connect order for installation of a connection or side sewer requiring compliance with said provisions insofar as is reasonably possible, and such connect order shall be issued only upon the condition that the property owner shall record with the Benton County Auditor an instrument acceptable to the Director agreeing to save harmless and indemnify the City from any damage or injury resulting from such installation. This section is not intended to be used to alter prescribed usage of storm and sanitary sewers. 
(3)  Inspection. 
(a)  Any licensed contractor or person performing the connection shall, prior to backfilling, call for inspection of the building sewer by the building official and for inspection of the side sewer connection by the Director, 48 hours in advance of the desired inspections, excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays. The location of the premises by address and the file number of the permit shall be given. 
(b)  If the inspector finds the work performed or materials used not in accordance with this chapter and Chapters 14.24 through 14.28, and rules and regulations, and the city standard plans and specifications, he shall notify the person doing the work and the owner or occupant of the premises by written notice. Such notice shall be all that is required to be given of the defects in the work or materials found in such inspection that must be corrected before acceptance of the work. Either the contractor, person, or a competent representative shall be on the premises, whenever so requested to meet the Director. The property owner shall also meet the Director at a mutually convenient time during regular hours of business when requested. 
(4)  Service Taps. When a public sewer system service tap is required for the connecting property's side sewer connection, the City shall perform the service tap.

If such owner, agent, lessee or occupant fails, neglects or refuses to connect said land, buildings, premises or habitable structures to the public sewer system within the time specified, the Director may make such connection, and the cost, plus overhead thereon shall become the connection charge to the owner, agent, lessee or occupant, and a bill showing the amount thereof shall be mailed or delivered to him, or posted upon the premises, whereupon the amount shall immediately be paid to the City Finance Department. 
(6)  Connection Easements. Before a building sewer may be located on private property other than the property being served by the building sewer, and before the Director issues a permit authorizing the laying of such building sewer, the owner of the building sewer shall secure a written easement from the owner of the property to be crossed. The easement shall be duly acknowledged, and shall grant the right to occupy the property for building sewer or utility purposes. The easement shall be recorded in the office of the Benton County Auditor by the owner of the building sewer, and the recording number shall be exhibited to the Director. 
(7)  Connection Reuse. Where a new or converted building or new installation replaces an old one, the use of an existing side sewer will be permitted when approved by the Director as conforming to all requirements of this Chapter and Chapters 14.24 through 14.28.

(9)  Special Connections. 
(a)  In any building, structure or premises in which the plumbing outlets or other drainage facilities are too low in elevation, as determined by the Director, to permit gravity flow to the public sewer system, wastewater shall be lifted mechanically and discharged into the public sewer. 
(b)  Whenever a situation exists involving danger of backups of sewage or drainage from a public sewer system, the Director may prescribe a minimum elevation at which the building drain may be discharged to the public sewer system. Wastewater from drains or side sewers below such minimum elevation shall be lifted mechanically to an elevation determined by the Director, or, if approved by the Director, a backwater sewage valve may be installed, provided the property owner records with the Benton County Auditor an instrument as described in subsection (b) of subsection (2) of this section. The effective operation and maintenance of the backwater sewage valve or the mechanical lifting device shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
(10)  Connection Size. Every dwelling unit or building shall be separately and independently connected with the public sewer, when such sewer is provided, unless such connection is six-inch diameter pipe or larger, except in accordance with subsection (b) of subsection (2) of this section. Four inches shall be the minimum diameter of pipe for gravity flow building sewers and side sewers. Pipe diameter of side sewers, for multiple dwelling, industrial or commercial buildings, shall be in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code and/or as required by the Engineer or Director. 
(11)  Outside City Limit Connections. 
(a)  The Director, in addition to the application for water and sewer service set out above, will require from all applicants residing outside the territorial limits of the City, such documents as he deems necessary to ensure that the property of the applicant, or any persons claiming title through the applicant, will be annexed to the City when it becomes reasonably contiguous. In the event that the applicant refuses to execute any document as required or attempts to impair or repudiate any document or agreement executed either by himself or a predecessor in interest, the City's duty to supply services shall cease. In the event that property reasonably contiguous to the City becomes annexed and then removed as the result of a reduction of the City limits (except when initiated by resolution) or when the proposed annexation of an area fails or is held invalid, the City's duty to provide service thereto shall cease. 
(b)  Developments or groups requesting connection to the public water and sewer systems outside the City limits shall be submitted for approval to the Director and the City Council after completion of pre-zoning per RCW 35A.14.330, subject to the conditions imposed thereby.

Significant Industrial Users discharging more than 100 mg/L may be required to install additional treatment or implement facility specific BMPs. 
(2)  Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW except as authorized by an industrial user permit and/or this chapter. If the industrial user has a pretreatment facility, all floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility or to sumps or tanks that do not have the potential for a discharge to the POTW before connecting with the POTW. The City may require other industrial users to contain or collect wastewater from floor drains to protect the POTW and meet the objectives of this chapter. 
(3)  Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The national categorical pretreatment standards as amended and promulgated by the EPA pursuant to the Act and as found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated and shall be enforceable under this chapter. 
(4)  State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter or other applicable ordinances. 
(5)  Specific Discharge Limitations 
(a)  No Significant Industrial User (SIU) or other designated non-SIU shall discharge or cause to be discharged, wastewater containing pollutants that exceed the following limits: 
Pollutant Daily Maximum Discharge Limits (1) 
mg/L Maximum Allowable Industrial Loading (MAIL) 2 
lbs/day Arsenic 0.12 1.5916 Cadmium 0.328 1.0800 Chromium 4.47 7366.2020 Copper 1.93 25.4997 Lead 1.385 9.1289 Mercury 0.106 0.349900 Molybdenum 0.89 2.9297 Nickel 3.02 19.9166 Selenium 0.56 3.7098 Silver 0.76 25.0345 Zinc 4.74 65.5402 Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) - 100mg/L and/or 25% of the working capacity of any chamber of the grease interceptor  
1 All pollutants as Total and in mg/L unless otherwise specified. 
2 This MAIL is the total lbs/day that the City may allocate to SIUs and other designated non-SIUs. The City intends to control discharges by applying the Daily Maximum Discharge Limits through Industrial User Wastewater Discharge permits. The City may allocate the MAIL where uniform concentration is not appropriate. 
(b)  The following limits shall apply to wastewaters that are discharged from: 
(i)  Groundwater cleanup of petroleum or gasoline underground storage tanks or other remediation wastewaters containing these pollutants; 
(ii)  Discharges where one or more of these pollutants are present; or 
(iii)  Where these pollutants are appropriate surrogates. 
It shall be unlawful for any Industrial User to discharge or cause to be discharged any waste or wastewater to the POTW that exceeds the following limits: 
Pollutant (1)(3) Daily Maximum Limit (mg/L) Benzene 0.050 BTEX (2) 0.750  
1 All pollutants shown in the Table are total. 
2 BTEX shall be measured as the sum of Benzene, Ethylbenzene, Toluene and Xylenes. 
3 These limits are based upon installation of air stripping technology as described in the EPA document: "Model NPDES Permit for Discharges Resulting from the Cleanup of Gasoline Released from Underground Storage Tanks. June 1989." 
(c)  The Public Works Director may establish more stringent pollutant limits, additional site-specific pollutant limits, Best Management Practices, or additional Pretreatment Requirements when, in the judgment of the Public Works Director, such limitations are necessary to implement the provisions of this Chapter. 
(6)  City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(7)  Special Agreement. The City reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. 
(8)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of processed water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Public Works Director may impose mass limitations on users which he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(9)  Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the Public Works Director, whichever are more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the City under the provisions of this chapter. 
(10)  Deadline for Compliance with Applicable Pretreatment Requirements. Compliance by existing users (categorical users) covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The City shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. 
New sources and new users shall install and have in operating condition and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. 
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in the EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in noncompliance with any local limits, shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit or registered letter for non-categorical users to ensure compliance within the shortest time feasible. 
(11)  Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
(a)  Whenever deemed necessary, the Public Works Director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Each user discharging to the POTW greater than 25,000 gallons per day or greater than five percent of the average daily flow into the POTW, whichever is less, may be required to install and maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a 24-hour period. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(c)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Public Works Director in specifications with current Uniform Plumbing Code and/or any City Standard Specifications and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
Where installed, all grease, oil and sand traps (or interceptors) shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times and subject to inspection. In the event the owner fails to properly maintain the grease trap (or interceptor), which, in the opinion of the Director, causes or has the potential to cause clogging of the sewer lines and/or pump stations, the cost of the City, time and material, in cleaning the sewer lines and/or pump stations may be charged to the owner of the grease trap. For the purpose of this paragraph, the owner shall be the person, firm or corporation named on the sewer account. For the purpose of this subsection, a grease interceptor is not in continuous efficient operation and is in violation of this section if the total volume of grease, solids, or food waste at any time displaces more than 25 percent of the effective volume of any chamber of the grease interceptor. 
The user shall have a written record of trap and/or interceptor maintenance on site for inspection and all such records shall be available for inspection by the City of Kennewick, and shall be kept in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of KMC 14.23.040. Grease trap maintenance will be recorded/reported on a monthly basis; Interceptors will be recorded/reported on their designated cleaning frequency. At the discretion of the Public Works Director, reports may be required to be submitted to the City's Pretreatment Inspector via e-mail, fax, postal mail or electronic form submission when it becomes available. 
(d)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(12)  Accidental Spill Prevention Plans/Slug Control Plans. The Public Works Director may require any user to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan (ASPP)/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the City, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan or slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review and approval before implementation. The City shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within 120 days after notification by the City. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. 
(a)  Any user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(i)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(ii)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(iii)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the standards in subsections (1) through (4) of this section; and 
(iv)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(b)  Users shall notify the City wastewater treatment plant immediately after the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof under state or federal law. 
(c)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Public Works Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property. Nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(d)  Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. 
(13)  Septic Tank Wastes/RV Dump Sites. 
(a)  Entities that supply an RV dumping connection to the POTW must secure a permit/permission from the City of Kennewick as authorized in KMC 14.23.030. 
(b)  Septic tank waste haulers are not allowed to discharge loads into the POTW and must dispose of their loads as outlined in their permit with the Department of Ecology and at a Department of Health approved facility. 
(c)  Fees for RV dump connections will be established as part of the user fee system as authorized in KMC 14.23.140.

(h)  The user shall submit any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Public Works Director to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. 
(6)  Signatory and Certification Requirement. All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative. For the purpose of this section, a responsible officer or manager means: 
(a)  A president, vice-president, secretary, or treasurer of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation; or 
(b)  The manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities, provided the manager is authorized to make management decisions which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; can ensure that the necessary information for control mechanism requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures. This authorization must be made in writing by the principal executive officer or ranking elected official and submitted to the approval authority prior to, or together with, the report being submitted of the user and contain the following certification statement: 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
A duly authorized representative is an individual designated by the responsible officer, manager, sole proprietor or general partner in writing. The written authorization must be submitted to the City and also specifies either an individual or a position having the responsibility of the overall operation of the facility from which the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company. If an authorization in this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of this section must be submitted to the City prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(7)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Issuance Decisions. The Public Works Director will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within 90 days of receipt of a complete wastewater discharge permit application, the Public Works Director will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit. Upon a determination to issue, the permit shall be issued within 90 days of full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished. The Public Works Director may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit.

(10)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration. Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the Public Works Director. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire. 
(11)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification. The Public Works Director may modify the wastewater discharge permit for good cause including, but not limited to, the following: 
(a)  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
(b)  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
(c)  A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
(d)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the City's POTW, city personnel, or the receiving waters; 
(e)  Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; 
(f)  Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required report; 
(g)  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13; 
(h)  To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or 
(i)  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator. 
(12)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner and/or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 days' advance notice to the Public Works Director and the Public Works Director approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the Public Works Director must include a written certification by the new owner and/or operator which: 
(a)  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
(b)  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(c)  Assumes full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit beginning on the date of transfer. 
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer. 
Provided that the above occurs and that there were no significant changes to the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner will be considered an existing user and be covered by the existing limits and requirements in the previous owner's permit. 
(13)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation. Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(a)  Failure to notify the City of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
(b)  Failure to provide prior notification to the City of changed conditions; 
(c)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(d)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports; 
(e)  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
(f)  Refusing to allow the City timely access to the facility premises and records; 
(g)  Failure to meet discharge limitations; 
(h)  Failure to pay fines; 
(i)  Failure to pay sewer charges; 
(j)  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
(k)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(l)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted facility; 
(m)  If the City has to invoke its emergency provision as cited in KMC 14.23.090(7); or 
(n)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter. 
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user. 
(14)  Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user who is required to have a wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete wastewater discharge permit application, in accordance with subsection (5) of this section, a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who has submitted its re-application in the time period specified herein shall be deemed to have an effective wastewater discharge permit until the City issues or denies the new wastewater discharge permit. A user whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who failed to submit its re-application in the time period specified herein will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater discharge permit. 
(15)  Pretreatment Equipment Modification. Before the construction, addition or modification of pretreatment equipment, the user must submit an engineering report to the City for approval. 
(16)  Public Notice. The City's pretreatment program encourages public involvement of permit development activities by publishing an announcement on the City's official webpage two weeks prior to the issuance of an industrial wastewater permit. The publication describes the industrial user applying for a permit, the tentative determination of the permit process, and where interested persons can submit written comments and/or review proposed permits and related documents. 
If the comments received indicate significant public interest in the proposed permit, or if useful information could be produced thereby, the Public Works Director may hold a public hearing on the application. Public notice regarding any hearing will be circulated at least 30 days in advance of the public hearing on the city's webpage and notifications will be sent to all individuals providing comments that provide contact information. 
    If a small number of comments are received, the City's pretreatment program will review them and respond in writing, either on an individual basis to each comment or comments in a single "Response to Comment" document issued at the same time as the final permit. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.040: - Reporting Requirements. 
(1)  Baseline Monitoring Reports. Categorical users who submit permit applications as described in KMC 14.23.030(5) shall be considered to have complied with requirement in 40 CFR Section 403.12(b) to submit baseline monitoring reports. 
(2)  Final Compliance Report (Initial Compliance Report). 
(a)  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this chapter, in a wastewater discharge permit, or within 30 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source or new users considered by the City to fit the definition of SIU, the affected user shall submit to the City a report containing the information outlined in KMC 14.23.030(5)(d) through (f). 
(b)  For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the City in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(3)  Periodic Compliance Report. 
(a)  Any user that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit and performs self-monitoring shall submit to the City during the months of June and December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the City, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their discharge at least twice per year. 
(b)  The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required by the wastewater discharge permit. 
(c)  Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the City or by this chapter, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period. 
(d)  Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the City or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical standards shall report production data as outlined in subsection (2)(b) of this section. 
(e)  If the City calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or nonregulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated process flows, dilution flows and nonregulated flows. 
(f)  Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided, however, that the City may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the City determines that an actual measurement is not feasible. 
(g)  Discharges sampled shall be representative of the user's daily operations and samples shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in KMC 14.23.050. 
(h)  The City may require reporting by users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of the sewer system. 
(i)  The City may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the City agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the City for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The City is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user. 
(4)  Compliance Schedule for Meeting Applicable Pretreatment Standards. 
(a)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
(b)  No increment referred to in subsection (4)(a) of this section shall exceed nine months. 
(c)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the City including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports. 
(5)  Notification of Significant Production Change. Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the City within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit. 
(6)  Hazardous Waste Notification. 
(a)  Any industrial user shall notify the City, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification to the City shall be made within the appropriate time frames specified in subsection (7) or (9) of this section, whichever is shorter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements as specified in subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section. Such notification must include: 
(i)  The name of the hazardous waste as set forth at 40 CFR Part 261; 
(ii)  The EPA hazardous waste number; 
(iii)  The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other); 
(iv)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
(v)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; 
(vi)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months; 
(vii)  Certification that the industrial user has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical; and 
(viii)  Signatory certification as required by KMC 14.23.030(6). 
(b)  Any industrial user shall notify the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of the discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261 and meets the reporting criteria specified at 40 CFR 403.12(p). Notification to the Washington State Department of Ecology and EPA is the responsibility of the industrial user and shall be made as required under 40 CFR 403.12(p). The industrial user shall copy the City on all notifications made to the state and EPA. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulation under Section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the City, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and Washington State Department of Ecology hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise allowed to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(7)  Notice of Potential Problems, Including Accidental Spills, Slug Loadings. Any user shall notify the City immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in KMC 14.23.010(3). The notification shall include the concentration and volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact should also be noted during the notification. Any user who discharges a slug (or slugs) of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City under state or federal law. 
(8)  Noncompliance Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within five days and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. (Where the City has the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the City must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis.) Resampling is not required if: 
(a)  The City performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(b)  The City performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(9)  Notification of Changed Discharge. All users shall promptly notify the City in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant regulated or manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications and the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
(10)  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the City as the Public Works Director may require. 
(11)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses including documentation associated with BMPs. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Public Works Director. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.050 - Sampling and analytical requirements. 
(1)  Sampling Requirements for Users. 
(a)  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH (unless performing continuous pH monitoring), cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. The sample must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during the 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. 
(b)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH (unless performing continuous pH monitoring), cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(c)  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the City and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the City has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s). 
(d)  All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis and shall certify that the waste stream sampled is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. 
(2)  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(3)  City Monitoring of User's Wastewater. The City will follow the same procedures as outlined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.060: - Compliance Monitoring. 
(1)  Inspection and Sampling. The City shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the Public Works Director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties. 
(a)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Public Works Director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(b)  The Public Works Director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(c)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Public Works Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(d)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(2)  Compliance monitoring of grease interceptors will be done by the following method: 
(a)  Liquid column samples will be taken from random sections of all interceptor chambers. 
(b)  The amounts of fats/oils/grease and the sludge at the bottom of the chamber will be measured. 
(c)  The percent of the capacity of the interceptor will be calculated using the average numbers from a minimum of three samples taken. 
(d)  The average must be below 25 percent of the capacity within any chamber of the interceptor. 
(3)  Compliance monitoring of grease traps will be done by the following method: 
(a)  Review of maintenance records. 
(b)  Visual inspections of the grease trap and its contents. 
(4)  Monitoring Facilities. Each user shall provide and operate, at its own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the City. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, provided that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The Public Works Director, whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system). 
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
The Public Works Director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Search Warrants. If the Public Works Director has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the City designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Public Works Director shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure warrant from the Superior Court of Benton County. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the Public Works Director in the company of a uniformed police officer of the City. 
(6)  Vandalism. No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.070: - Confidential Information. 
    Information and data regarding a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.080: - Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance. 
    The City reserves the right to publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1); 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1), multiplied by the TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, longer-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the City believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the City's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which the City determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. 5420 Sec. 1(part), 2012) 
14.23.090: - Administrative Enforcement Remedies. 
(1)  Notification of Violation. When the Public Works Director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation (via certified letter). Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Public Works Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent Orders. The Public Works Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (4) and (5) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(3)  Show Cause Hearing. The Public Works Director may order (via a certified letter) a user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Public Works Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(4)  Compliance Orders. When the Public Works Director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued until adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(5)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the Public Works Director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Public Works Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(a)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(b)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(6)  Administrative Fine. 
(a)  When the Public Works Director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Director may fine such user in an amount not less than $500.00 and not to exceed $10,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Public Works Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Public Works Director shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. 
The City may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(7)  Emergency Suspensions. The Public Works Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Public Works Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(a)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Public Works Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The water and waste utilities department shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (8) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(b)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Public Works Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (3) and (8) of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(8)  Termination of Discharge (Nonemergency). In addition to the provisions in KMC 14.23.030(13), any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(a)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;

(Ord. 5420 Sec.1(part), 2012) 
14.23.120: - Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations. 
(1)  Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (1)(c) of this section are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(i)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(ii)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(iii)  The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
(A)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(B)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(C)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(2)  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in KMC 14.23.020(1)(b)(i) through (vii) and (2) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(a)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(b)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(3)  Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(i)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(ii)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. "Severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (3)(c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice of Bypass. 
(i)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(ii)  A user shall submit oral notice to the City of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Bypass Conditions. 
(i)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(A)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(B)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(C)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3)(c) of this section. 
(ii)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (3)(d)(i) of this section.

For analyses conducted by a third party commercial laboratory, the permittee will be charged the actual fees charged by the laboratory. For analyses conducted by the City laboratory, the permittee will be charged the actual cost of the analyses, not to exceed fees established by locally available commercial laboratories. 
(ii)  Any user establishing a pattern of noncompliance, or having a history of noncompliance, or suspected of being in noncompliance, may require additional monitoring visits as deemed appropriate by the Public Works Director. Any additional analysis performed which detects noncompliance will be billed directly to the user. 
(h)  A discharge authorization shall be $250.00 for a one-time batch discharge. 
(i)  Permit Transfer Fee: $250.00. 
(j)  Permit Modification Fee: $500.00. Permit modification fees will only be charged in a case where changes in the user's operation require the modification, or when the user requests a modification. 
(k)  High Strength Waste Fees. 
(i)  Users having effluent concentrations of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in excess of 240 mg/l and/or Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in excess of 250 mg/l, shall be subject to a high strength waste fee. The rates for high strength waste are based on cost of treatment in the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW). 
(A)  Current costs for treatment of one pound of BOD and TSS is $0.38 and $0.33, respectively, and are subject to change to comply with the actual cost of treatment as directed by the Public Works Director. 
(ii)  Calculation of Fees. High strength waste fees are based upon pollutants in excess of thresholds established by the Public Works Director and adopted by the City Council. The fees shall be based upon the total metered water supplied to the premises. The high strength waste fees may be reduced where commercial or industrial wastewater is discharged separately from domestic sanitary wastes or cooling waters and the user provides a meter or other measurement method acceptable to the Public Works Director. For multiple tenant buildings with shared water service, high strength waste fees will be apportioned by class of individual tenants with an estimated volume as a portion of the total sewer bill. 
(iii)  Methodologies for Calculating High Strength Waste Fees. Composite samplers shall be placed at each high strength discharge site and a rolling average shall be developed using concentrations of the ten most recent monthly samples collected. Rolling averages shall be initiated with samples taken over a 30-day period at not less than one sample per week unless otherwise specified by the Public Works Director. 
(iv)  Composite Samplers. All high strength waste dischargers shall be required to provide a secure space for and install a composite sampler provided by the City that will be used for random sampling and development of the high strength waste fees.

CHAPTER 14.26 - SANITARY SEWER USER CHARGES 

14.26.010: - User Charge Basis. 
    Each connection to the sanitary sewer from single-family dwelling unit, multi-family dwelling unit, commercial and industrial accounts shall have a user charge assessed and collected bi-monthly by the City Treasurer on the following basis: 
(1)  Single-Family Dwelling Unit Accounts: A flat fee charge rate shall be charged. 
(2)  Multi-Family Dwelling Unit Accounts: A variable charge rate based upon metered water consumption shall be charged. The rate shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  A rate, never less than a minimum charge, equal in amount to the single-family dwelling unit flat fee charge rate, normally; 
(b)  Effective January 1, 2019, a rate determined by multiplying the user charge rate (dollars per 100 cubic feet discharged) by the metered water consumption in hundred cubic feet and an $13.29 per unit service fee, plus any modifications authorized under Section 14.26.070, for each two-month billing cycle and effective January 1, 2020, a rate determined by multiplying the user charge rate (dollars per 100 cubic feet discharged) by the metered water consumption in 100 cubic feet and a rate that has been increased by an additional 5.4 percent, plus any modifications authorized under Section 14.26.070 per unit service fee for each two-month billing cycle; but 
(c)  Never higher than a maximum charge determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units in the account by the single-family dwelling unit flat fee rate. 
(3)  Commercial/Industrial Accounts: A variable charge rate based upon metered water consumption shall be charged. The rate shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  A rate never less than a minimum charge equal in amount to the single-family dwelling unit flat fee charge rate, normally; 
(b)  Effective January 1, 2019, a rate determined by multiplying the user's charge rate (dollars per 100 cubic feet discharged) by the metered water consumption in hundred cubic feet and an $13.29 per unit service fee, plus any modifications authorized under Section 14.26.070, for each two-month billing cycle and effective January 1, 2020, a rate determined by multiplying the user charge rate (dollars per 100 cubic feet discharged) by the metered water consumption in hundred cubic feet and a rate that has been increased by an additional 5.4 percent, plus any modifications authorized under Section 14.26.070 per unit service fee for each two-month billing cycle; but 
(c)  If the metered water consumption is not representative of the wastewater discharged into the sanitary sewer, a factor "K" may be applied to the rate determined in subdivision (b) of this subsection. The factor "K" is a ratio found by dividing the volume of wastewater discharged by the metered water consumption, both determined simultaneously during a common time period. It is the responsibility of the City that their proposed "K" factor is a valid value. 
(4)  Outside City Limits Accounts: All accounts outside the City limits shall be assessed a 50-percent surcharge over and above the respective inside City limits rates. 
(5)  The usual charge for sanitary sewer service shall be billed to the user, when possible, on the same bill as for domestic water. Sewer service charges shall become delinquent 15 days after date of billing. 
(6)  Quantity discounts to large-volume users shall not be allowed.

The remedies and relief provided in this chapter are exclusive and any person filing a claim under the provisions of this chapter shall be barred from seeking relief which may otherwise be available if he elects to pursue a claim under these provisions.

(1)  There is hereby imposed a surcharge upon all sewer accounts, not to exceed two percent, taxes excluded, which shall be placed into the Risk Management Fund for the purpose of paying any claim compensable under this chapter. The said Fund shall be maintained at a level determined by the Director as necessary to meet the liabilities provided herein and to defray the costs and expenses of administering these provisions. The amount of surcharge shall be reduced or eliminated once the Fund has reached the maximum set by the Director. Interest accrued upon the said Fund shall be allowed to increase the total to 25 percent above the maximum provided and all surpluses thereafter shall be placed into the Water and Sewer Revenue Fund. In the event that the maximum is later reduced or the account eliminated, all funds remaining therein shall be placed in the Water and Sewer Revenue Fund.

(1)  Any person electing to file a claim under the provisions of this chapter shall be limited to the relief provided herein. Any person electing to pursue any remedy other than that specifically provided herein, shall be barred from recovery under these provisions. 
(2)  In the event of damage caused by a sewer backup into residential, commercial or industrial property, the Director is authorized to pay special damages proximately caused by the backup only for the following items: 
(a)  Damage to property, real and personal; 
(b)  Expenses of cleaning and necessary repainting; 
(c)  Medical expenses; and 
(d)  Expenses of temporary dislocation, such as temporary housing and meal costs. 
Damages will be paid for the diminution in value of property or if not practical, fair market value. Title to the property in the latter case vests in the City. Damage will be paid for carpets which cannot be cleaned, but not for expensive rugs which serve other than a utilitarian purpose. Only in extraordinary cases will clothing be other than cleaned. 
There shall be no recovery for items of an historical or sentimental nature nor any other item which because of its age, scarcity, etc. has increased in value, such as magazines, stamps, books, curiosities, paintings, art objects and similar such items and collections. There shall be no recovery for general damages such as pain and suffering, wrongful death, loss of consortium, etc. 
(3)  The City shall be allowed to first inspect all damaged property. The claimant must provide an inventory and expense account. 
(4)  There shall be deducted from the compensable claims, any amounts received from insurance or other collateral sources. 
(5)  Upon the first occurrence of a sewer backup resulting from a plugged City main line, the City shall pay 100 percent of the compensable amount. No claim shall be paid until such time as a backflow prevention device is installed by the property owner. The device must be installed within 60 days of the date of backup, unless an extension is approved by the Director. Upon a second occurrence of sewer backup, the City will pay 75 percent of the compensable amount should it be determined by the City's Building Inspector that the installed backflow prevention device was not maintained properly. The City shall not pay for damages for any further occurrences of backup where the backflow prevention device was determined by the City Building Inspector to be maintained improperly. No recovery shall be allowed for the failure of any private fixture or device, such as pumps and plumbing, or for a subsequent backup, without a backflow prevention device having been installed. 
(6)  A claim or claims which cannot be paid with revenues collected within one year from the date of first claim exhausting the funds, shall be reduced in proportion to revenues collected over the year following the first claim. A claim or claims in excess of revenue, as above-described, is not compensable under this chapter and may not be recovered otherwise unless the claimant elects to proceed wholly without the scope of the recovery provided in this chapter.

The recommendations must be approved by HUD. The manufacturer must send two copies of its approved installation recommendations to the purchaser of the mobile home. The copies must be in the home and available at the time of inspection. 
A mobile home not labeled by HUD must be installed in accord with installation recommendations provided by a professional engineer or architect licensed in Washington. 
(3)  To the extent that the installation of a mobile home is not covered by a manufacturer's, engineer's, or architect's recommendations, the mobile home must comply with the installation requirements set out in this chapter. 
(4)  No person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity may install a mobile home unless he owns the mobile home or is a licensed mobile home installer under RCW 43.63B. 
(5)  In those areas that are (a) recognized as flood plains by the Washington State Department of Ecology or the Federal Emergency Management Agency; or (b) hazardous because of the probability of earthquakes, ground slides, avalanches, or high winds, the City may impose conditions which lessen the hazards. 
(6)  For the purposes of this Chapter, a mobile home is a structure; transportable in one or more sections; which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width; and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the necessary or appropriate utilities (and includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein). Any structure certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a mobile home is a mobile home. 
(7)  Exempted from the requirement of installation permits and inspections are single-wide units which are less than eight feet in width and 32 feet in length. The units must rest on their own wheels. Skirting is optional. The vehicles may be connected to community sewer and water facilities. Exempted units will be inspected if requested by the occupant and required fees are paid.

15.60.030: - Inspections. 
(1)  The installer must request an inspection after all aspects of the installation, other than installation of the foundation facia, have been completed. The City will inspect the installation within five business days after it receives the request. The tenant or owner may occupy the mobile home at his own risk prior to obtaining the installation permit or completion of any city inspection. Occupancy before inspection does not imply city approval. 
(2)  The City will approve the installation of a mobile home, and allow the mobile home to be permanently occupied if the installation complies with the installation requirements of this chapter and the conditions of the installation permit, and other applicable laws. 
(3)  If the installation does not comply with this chapter and the installation permit, the City will provide the installer with a list of corrections that the installer must make. The list of corrections will state a date by which the corrections must be completed. The City will reinspect the installation after the corrections are completed.

A ground anchor, when installed, must be able to resist a working load of 3,150 pounds in the direction of the tie plus a 50-percent overload (4,725 pounds total) without failure. Failure occurs if the point of connection of a vertical tie to an anchor is withdrawn more than two inches at 3,150 pounds, or when the point of connection of a diagonal tie is moved more than four inches horizontally when a load of 3,150 pounds is applied at 45 degrees from the horizontal. Ground anchors must be marked with the manufacturer's identification and model number in a location that is visible after the anchor is installed. The manufacturer of a ground anchor must provide instructions with each anchor that specify the kinds of soil for which the anchor is suitable. 
(3)  If concrete slabs or continuous footings are used to transfer the anchoring loads to the ground, the following requirements apply: 
(a)  Steel rods cast in concrete must be able to resist the loads and corrosion as specified for ground anchors. 
(b)  A deadman anchor may be used in place of a listed anchor. It must be constructed of solid concrete at least six inches in diameter and two feet long, reinforced with two #4 deformed steel rods, and installed at least five feet below the surface of the ground. 
(c)  A concrete slab may be used in place of a ground anchor if it provides holding strength equal to that required for ground anchors. 
(4)  Ties must be of cable, strapping, or other approved materials. Ties must be fastened to ground anchors and drawn tight with turnbuckles, yoke fasteners, or other approved tensioning devices. 
    Tension devices must end in clevis, forged, or welded eyes. Hook ends are not permitted. Tension devices must be designed to prevent self-disconnection if the tie becomes slack. Cable tie eyes must be secured with two U-bolt cable clamps or an approved equivalent. 
    Tie materials must be able to resist a working load of 3,150 pounds with no more than 2 percent elongation and withstand a 50-percent overload (4,725 pounds total). 
    Ties must connect the ground anchor to the main frame longitudinal member. Ties may not connect to steel outrigger beams that fasten to the main frame, unless the manufacturer's installation instructions specifically approve the connection. 
    Diagonal ties must lie at least 40 degrees from the vertical. Vertical ties must be substantially vertical. If a vertical tie is not substantially vertical, the anchor must be placed outboard of the tie's connection to the main frame. 
    A cable frame tie must be connected to the main frame by a five-eighths-inch drop, forged, closed-eye bolt through a hole drilled in the center of the I-beam web, or by an approved alternative. The installer must reinforce the web if necessary to maintain the strength of the I-beam. 
    The installer must space the ties as evenly as practical, and must locate a tie within eight feet of each end of the mobile home. The installer may attach two or more ties to a single ground anchor if the anchor can carry the total required load. The installer must install vertical ties at each detached corner of a clerestory roof and of add-on sections of expandable mobile homes. 
    As a minimum, the installer must install the following number of ties for each I-beam or other main frame longitudinal member: 
Length of Home (Feet) Excluding Hitch Number of Vertical Ties Number of Diagonal Ties 32-54 2 3 55-73 2 4

17.10.230: - Certification of Survey. 
    The survey of the proposed subdivision and preparation of the final plat must be made by or under the supervision of a registered land surveyor, who must certify on the plat that it is a true and correct representation of the lands actually surveyed. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010)

    Every final plat must contain a certificate giving a full and correct description of the lands as they appear on the plat, including a statement that the subdivision has been made with the consent and in accord with the desires of the owner or owners. If the plat contains a dedication, the certificate or a separate written instrument must so indicate. The certificate or instrument of dedication must be signed and acknowledged before a notary public by all parties having any interest in the lands and recorded as part of the final plat. Every plat containing a dedication filed for record must be accompanied by a title report confirming that the title of the lands as described and shown on the plat is in the name of the owner signing the certificate or instrument of dedication. An offer of dedication may include a waiver of right of direct access to any street from the property, and if the dedication is accepted, any such waiver becomes effective. Such a waiver may be required by the City as a condition of approval. Roads not dedicated to the public must be clearly marked on the face of the plat.

The original must be filed with the County Auditor. One reproducible copy and one paper copy must be furnished to the City Engineer. One paper copy must be filed with the County Assessor. Paper copies must be made available to other agencies at no expense to the City. Any lot in a final plat is a valid nonconforming use, notwithstanding any change in zoning for a period of five years from the date of filing. A subdivision is governed by the terms of its approval and the law in effect at the time, for a period of five years after preliminary plat approval, unless the City Council finds that a change in conditions creates a serious threat to the public health or safety. Nothing contained in this section shall act to prevent the City from adopting, by ordinance, procedures which would allow extensions of time that may or may not contain additional or altered conditions and requirements. 
(Ord. 5415 Sec. 15, 2012; Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010)

All or a portion of security will be released upon acceptance of the improvements by the City Engineer, or upon substitution of another approved bond or security. All streets and other public rights-of-way must be improved within two years after final plat approval, in accord with the approved plans. If, after two years, all public rights-of-way are not so improved, the City will cause the streets to be improved in accord with the approved plans, and the costs thereof must be paid by the bonding company, or out of the savings account assignment or other security. In lieu of the plat bond, a cash bond, a certified check, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other surety approved by the City Manager and City Attorney, equal to the cost of improvement may be posted. In addition, the City may require security up to two years against any defect in workmanship or materials in the installation of the improvements. Improvements must be designed and certified by a registered civil engineer prior to the acceptance. All city utility and street improvements must be approved by the City Engineer prior to final inspection and occupancy of any structure within the plat.

(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.10.280: - Unauthorized Sale or Transfer. 
    Whenever any parcel of land is divided, and any person, firm or corporation, or their agent sells or transfers, or offers or advertises for sale or transfer, any such lot, tract, or parcel without having a plat of such subdivision filed for record, the City Attorney may commence an action to restrain and enjoin further subdivisions, sales, transfers, or offers and to compel compliance with this Title.

(2)  All required infrastructure improvements must be substantially completed as approved by the Public Works Director. Minor improvements consisting only of sidewalks and landscaping where applicable, or similar improvements, as determined solely by the Public Works Director may be secured by a bond. 
(3)  In lieu of completion of these minor improvements, prior to recording of the binding site plan, a bond issued by a licensed corporate surety or two individual sureties or other approved surety must be provided, to the full amount of the cost of such work multiplied by 125 percent, as estimated or approved by the Public Works Director, including construction inspection costs, but in no case less than $2,000.00.

If such a need does or may exist, he may recommend that any approval be conditioned upon the dedication of right-of-way and the construction of needed streets to city standards. If the proposed binding site plan abuts an existing right-of-way, the City Engineer may recommend that additional right-of-way be dedicated to obtain one-half the required width of the street as established by any street plan and that the right-of-way be improved to city standards.

CHAPTER 17.20 - DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 

17.20.005: - Application of Chapter. 
    This Chapter applies to all divisions of land unless otherwise specifically provided herein. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.20.010: - Design and Construction Standards. 
(1)  Overall Design Aspects. 
(a)  Single-family platting and design must be in conformance with Chapter 18.75; commercial land platting and design must be in conformance with Chapter 18.78; 
(b)  The layout of a subdivision should be responsive to the topography and other natural features existing on site. It should cause as minimum an impact as possible in terms of grading and removal of existing mature vegetation. 
(2)  Streets. The street layout in a subdivision shall have a hierarchical design and efficient circulation system. Street layout in a subdivision must be designed for "street connectivity between neighborhoods," be "pedestrian friendly," and "promote function, safety and aesthetics with minimum adverse environmental impact" as stated in the City of Kennewick Comprehensive Plan. 

(a)  Residential streets should be less than 1,200 feet in continuous uninterrupted length and shall be designed with curves and changes in alignment as measures for traffic calming. Street network design shall be considered in such a way as to discourage cut-through traffic. Other traffic calming measures may be required or approved by the Traffic Engineer; 
(b)  The arrangement of streets in a division must conform, as nearly as possible, to the adopted Comprehensive Plan, or to any adopted street plan for the City; 
(c)  Streets shall normally continue as an extension of existing streets, unless good site planning dictates a different solution. Street patterns must take into consideration access to adjacent properties. Sketches of a proposed street system for adjoining properties may be required if owned by the subdivider, or if the arrangements of the large tracts make it necessary to provide future access through the property under consideration. 
(i)  A residential development that is served by a single city standard street over 600 feet in length (as measured from the point where two required access streets are not present) must have a second city standard street. 
(ii)  All developments shall include street connections to any streets that abut, are adjacent to, or terminate at the development site. 
(iii)  When feasible, developments should include streets that extend to undeveloped or partially developed land that is adjacent to the development site, unless separated from the development site by an irrigation canal, easement, or other site condition. The streets should be in locations that will enable adjoining properties to connect to the proposed development's street system. 
(d)  Preliminary plats may be applied for with only one entry for infill projects if they contain 50 dwelling units or less and it is not physically possible to have a second city standard street due to topographic or adjacent land ownership; however, final plats will be approved only if: 
(i)  Each dwelling unit within the subdivision is equipped with an International Fire Code (IFC) or equivalent approved sprinkler system that is installed and operable prior to final occupancy of said dwelling unit. 
(e)  Temporary dead end streets in excess of 600 feet shall be permitted in a phased development in which by the completion of the preliminary plat and subsequent filing of the final plat will provide a second permanent access. The acceptance of a temporary dead end street in a phased development will require the development of an approved secondary emergency vehicle access (SEVA) constructed to a standard approved by the City Engineer and shall be a part of the final plat of the first phase. In lieu of constructing a SEVA, each dwelling within the final plat shall be equipped with an International Fire Code (IFC) or equivalent approved sprinkler system that is installed and operable prior to final occupancy to said dwelling; 
(f)  Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall be permitted only where topography or other site conditions justify their use; 
(i)  Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length. 
(ii)  If a dead-end street is permitted, a turnaround shall be provided if required by the City Engineer or Fire Marshal. If the turnaround includes some private property, the turnaround right-of-way shall be protected by an easement, until the street is extended; 
(iii)  Clearly defined and identifiable pedestrian connections shall be provided from all dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs to the nearest existing or proposed public way; 
Undesired layout with cul-de-sacs 

Preferred layout with street connectivity 

(g)  Half Streets: Streets lying along the boundary of a division may be one-half the required width, if it is practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided; and, wherever there exists a dedicated half street of an adjoining division, the other half must be dedicated on the proposed division; 
(h)  If determined by the City Engineer, half street improvements will be required on existing streets where the subdivision abuts such existing street(s). Half street improvements shall be constructed per the latest City of Kennewick Standards and will include Streetlight(s), Storm System, and Traffic Control. 
(i)  Sidewalks shall be provided according to the applicable City Standards. Walkways and sidewalks shall create a network of connections with nearby open space, parks, schools, and other civic and retail amenities; 
(j)  Street names shall be assigned by the City in accordance with KMC 13.08 and KAC 13-56; 
(k)  Under normal conditions, streets must intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. The minimum angle of intersection is 80 degrees unless specifically allowed by the Traffic Engineer; 
(l)  Residential streets shall be aligned at the centerline or be offset a minimum of 125 feet while intersections with arterial or collector streets shall have a minimum centerline offset of 300 feet, unless specifically waived by the City Traffic Engineer; 

(m)  Whenever the proposed division contains, or is adjacent to, a railroad right-of-way, or the right-of-way of a limited access highway, freeway, arterial, or collector street, a frontage road at a distance appropriate for the proposed use of land between the right-of-way and the frontage road may be required. The distance shall be determined with due consideration for future grade separations and required lot depths. This frontage road needs not be a public street but must contain adequate drainage and lighting, and must be constructed to acceptable industry standards. Lots must abut and face this frontage road. An access easement may be required for the frontage road; 

(n)  City standard monuments shall be installed and permanently marked with the land surveyors registration number at all street centerline intersections and at all points of curvature tangency and centerline deflection, unless otherwise determined by the City Engineer. 
(3)  Blocks: 
(a)  Blocks shall be no longer than 900 feet unless topography, abutting development, existence of irrigation canals, critical areas, or other site features prohibit such or the block abuts an arterial or collector street. In such cases, the proposed layout must be approved by the City; 
(b)  Clearly defined and identifiable pedestrian connections shall be provided within blocks when the length of a block is more than 600 feet. Alternative designs that provide pedestrian connectivity within the subdivision may be permitted by the Plat Administrator (Administrator); 

(c)  Blocks shall allow for two tiers of lots between parallel streets unless abutting an arterial or collector street. Exceptions may be allowed if site features dictate their necessity. All exceptions shall be reviewed and approved by the Administrator and Traffic Engineer. 

(4)  Lots:

(d)  Lots shall not have direct driveway access onto arterial or collector streets unless approved by the Traffic Engineer; 
(e)  All residential lots shall abut a dedicated street for at least 30 feet unless developed with townhomes or rowhouses, then 20 feet, however, lots developed in accord with applicable sections of Chapter 18.75 or abutting a frontage road as indicated in Section 17.20.010(2)(l) need not abut a dedicated street; 
(f)  Prior to division approval, all lot corners shall be marked by a five-eighths inch diameter iron rod firmly driven into the ground to a depth of at least 24 inches. The land surveyor shall certify on the plat that the corners have been staked. Where lot corner markers are not evident, and prior to issuance of any building permit for construction within the division, a certified statement from a professional land surveyor must be submitted to the Building Inspector, stating that all corners of the property proposed for construction are marked by an iron pin firmly driven into the ground to a depth of at least 24 inches. 
(5)  Tracts: 
(a)  Tracts shall be called out on the face of the plat with notes indicating their intended use and whether said tracts are to be dedicated to a municipal corporation or school; 
(b)  Tracts may be used to preserve open space and environmentally sensitive areas per KMC Chapter 17.24; 
(c)  When a tract is to be subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels, the parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical re-subdivision and opening of future streets with provision for adequate utility connections. 
(6)  Parks and Open Space: 
(a)  Subdivisions that abut public or private parks or usable public open spaces shall have the frontage of the lots facing the park or open space. The Administrator may approve deviations from this standard if it can be shown that a different design can better promote the safety and welfare of the community; 
Lots facing open space 

Lots fronting open space. Vehicular access from alleys 

(b)  Private parks and open spaces shall have physical and/or visual access from the public right-of-way unless restricted by the specific subdivision conditions. The Administrator may approve deviations from this standard if it can be shown that a different design can better promote the safety and welfare of the community; 
(c)  Existing private and public easements of significant size and location shall be integrated into subdivisions as appropriate open space where possible. Subdivisions containing or abutting natural open spaces shall provide visual, and in some cases, pedestrian access to the natural open space area.

CHAPTER 17.24 - TECHNIQUES FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION 

17.24.010: - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to provide techniques, compensation and incentives for property owners who are required to protect natural resources located within the City according to KMC 18.58 through 18.63, and property owners choosing to protect natural resources within the City of Kennewick, thus preserving the City's natural resources while respecting the rights of property owners. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.24.020: - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this Chapter apply to all real property within the City of Kennewick which is classified as natural resource lands. Many of Kennewick's natural resources have been classified as critical areas and are required to be protected through the City's Critical Areas' Ordinance. Others have been designated in sub-area and master plans. While those that have been identified are required to be preserved, some property owners may feel that they have a significant resource that is of benefit to the community and worth protecting. In these cases the property owner, with approval from the City, may choose to preserve this resource and take advantage of the incentives outlined in this Chapter. Standards in this Chapter shall be used in addition to the standards of the underlying zone. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.24.030: - Natural Resources Classified. 
    Natural resources within the City of Kennewick shall be classified as the following: 
(1)  Critical areas and their associated buffers, which shall be preserved according to KMC 18.59, 18.60, 18.61, 18.62, and 18.63; 
(2)  Ridgelines, hilltops, canyons, trails and greenways, as identified in applicable sub-area or master plans, shall be preserved according to measures within their respective plans; and 
(3)  All other natural resource lands not indicated in KMC 17.24.030(1) and KMC 17.24.030(2) may be preserved by the property owner, with approval from the City, in order to utilize the incentives laid out in KMC 17.24.040. Examples of these lands may include natural drainage-ways, recreational trails, existing native vegetation, and land used to connect disconnected public spaces. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.24.040: - Standards and Techniques for Preserving Natural Resources. 
    Natural resources can be integrated with the site layout and be preserved by using special techniques. The tools and techniques provided in this section are intended to minimize impacts to natural resources lands. 
(1)  Onsite Density Transfer: A portion of the density for areas having natural resource lands that remain undeveloped may be transferred to other areas of the development site if clustering concepts are used and the project retains acceptable open space. The following chart indicates the amount of density that can be transferred, based on the area of the natural resource land being preserved; 
Category of Natural Resource Area Percent of Natural Resource Area Density That May Be Transferred 1. Wetlands and associated buffers 25% 2. Priority Habitat and associated buffers 3. Slopes = 40% 4. Landslide Hazard Areas 1. Slopes < 40% 100% 2. Erosion Hazard Areas 3. Flood zones  
(a)  For purposes of the density transfer, the natural resource area must be equal to or greater than the minimum lot size for the underlying zone, and the non-natural resource portion of the property must be able to accommodate a denser development; 
(b)  When using on-site density transfer, the density may be increased, not to exceed the maximum density of the next most intense zoning district. Also, the site development standards of the next most intense zone may be used as well; (see table below) 
Existing District District Using Density Transfer RS Becomes RL RL Becomes RM RM Becomes RH RH Remains RH  
(c)  An on-site density transfer shall meet the requirements and follow the procedures of the underlying land use permit processes such as, plats, short plats, binding site plans and/or planned development permits; 
(d)  On-site density transfers shall be recorded with all related conditions, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney, to become a part of the deed of the property and shall run with the land. 
(2)  Cluster Development: Subdivisions may cluster lots on the less sensitive portion of the parcel preserving the more sensitive natural resource lands that exist on the site. When utilizing cluster development to preserve natural resources, the required lot sizes, street frontages and setbacks may be reduced in accordance with Section 17.24.040(1)(b) in order to accommodate the cluster development. 
(3)  Conservation Easements: A conservation easement may be used to preserve natural open space as a stand-alone tool or in conjunction with a clustered development. Conservation easements shall be called out on the face of the plat; 
(4)  Tracts: Tracts may also be used to preserve open space through the platting process. (See KMC 17.20.010(5))

(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.32.030: - Unauthorized Sale or Transfer. 
    No person, firm, corporation, or agent may sell, transfer, offer, or advertise for sale or transfer, any unit within a condominium without the declarations, covenants, and bylaws first having been approved by the Planning Official. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.32.040: - Dedication of Park and Recreational Areas. 
    Before recording covenants, bylaws or declarations, every developer of a residential condominium must provide one or more open areas in accordance with KMC Section 18.12.010 A.2. Any appeal of the interpretation of this section must be made in writing to the Park and Recreation Commission within ten days. The developer must also provide for park and recreational areas in accord with Sections 17.100.010 to 17.100.040 inclusive. Apartments converted to condominiums need not comply with this section if recreational areas and park land have already been provided as required by this section. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.32.050: - Site Plan and Survey. 
    A site plan is required in accord with Section 18.42.110. The City will issue addresses for each unit during the site plan process. A Survey drawing showing the buildings and property lines, with City of Kennewick signature block is required. The survey drawing shall include all certificates mentioned in KMC Section 17.10.220(7)(a), (b), (c), (f), and (g). Survey drawing, after approved and signed by the City, shall be recorded at the Benton County Auditor's office. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.32.060: - Condominium Conversion. 
    All conversion of apartments to condominiums shall be in accordance with regulations as set forth in Chapters 64.32 RCW, The Condominium Act and 64.34 RCW, The Horizontal Property Regimes Act. Persons converting apartments to condominiums must provide, for approval, a copy of all covenants, bylaws, and declarations, including an indication of the parties responsible for all utility accounts; a maintenance agreement; and a site plan drawing and record survey in accordance with KMC 17.32.050. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
CHAPTER 17.100 - DEDICATIONS 

17.100.010: - Dedication of Land for Park Purposes. 
(1)  As a condition of the granting of approval for any division or redivision that will be used for residential purposes, a payment of an impact fee per KMC 3.90 shall be required for one or more of the following purposes: 
(a)  Acquisition or development of public open spaces devoted to public parks; and/or 
(b)  Trails; and/or 
(c)  Other recreational purposes. 
(2)  As an alternative to the payment of a park impact fee, an applicant may propose to dedicate park, trail or open space property to the City to receive credit or credits against the impact fees calculated for the applicant's development. For credits for dedications of property KMC 3.90 shall be followed. 
(3)  All proposals submitted to obtain credit towards park impact fees per KMC 3.90.080 shall be designed and constructed to the satisfaction of, and be approved by the City.

17.100.020: - Additional Park Land for Public Purchase-When. 
    Where a neighborhood park playground is proposed to be located wholly or partly within a proposed division, and where the projected population of the proposed division will not require dedication of land for the entire park, the developer may be required to reserve additional park land for purchase by the public within one year of the final division approval by the City Council. Prior to division approval, the City shall indicate if the additional park land is to be purchased. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.100.030: - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Sec. 2 of Ord. No. 5766 , adopted Oct. 2, 2018, repealed  17.100.030, which pertained to Development-Time Limit-Scope, and derived from Ord. 5280, 2010. 
17.100.040: - School and Park Sites to Abut. 
    If a division abuts an existing or proposed school site, any park site within the proposed division must normally abut the existing or proposed school site. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.100.050: - Acceptance of Dedications. 
    In addition to any method for dedicating property for public purposes and the acceptance thereof, whether authorized by statute or as provided by the common law of the State, the City Engineer may accept the dedication of any property for the purpose of increasing the right-of-way of any public way. 
(Ord. 5280 Sec. 1, 2010) 
17.100.060: - Dedications-Presumptions.

(iv)  All units with a common wall must be constructed concurrently and be under the same ownership at the time of initial construction; 
(v)  Common walls must follow property lines and have no openings. 
(6)  Townhouse/Rowhouse Development: 
(a)  All townhouse or rowhouse development shall comply with the Residential Design Standards-Multi-Family; 
(b)  There must be at least ten feet on end between groups. This space may either be end unit lots or common open space, and, if so, there may be openings in the end units; 
(c)  The number of connected units may not exceed eight; 
(d)  The Planning Director may approve up to a ten-percent deviation from all standards related to townhouse or rowhouse development. 
(7)  Urban Mixed Use District: 
(a)  Legal lots of record existing as of June 1, 2017, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the lot size restrictions, however after June 1, 2017, no lot intended for single-family use shall be created in excess of 5,000 square feet. 
(b)  Setbacks for all residential uses shall be measured from property lines. 
(c)  Building setback from front and side property lines are not required, except as mandated by the applicable local, state and federal codes.

CHAPTER 18.39 - OUTDOOR LIGHT 

18.39.010: - Purpose. 
(1)  Good outdoor lighting at night benefits everyone. It increases safety, enhances Kennewick's nighttime character, and helps provide security. New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful, and these types of lights may be improperly installed so that they create problems of excessive glare, light trespass, and higher energy use. Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause safety problems. Light trespass reduces everyone's privacy, and higher energy use results in increased costs for everyone. There is a need for a lighting ordinance, which recognizes the benefits of outdoor lighting and provides clear guidelines for its installation so as to help maintain and complement the character of Kennewick. Appropriately regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute to the public safety and welfare of the City's residents. 
(2)  This Chapter is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. It is intended to eliminate problems of glare, minimize light trespass into public spaces and private property, promote energy conservation, protect the nighttime character of the desert sky, and help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting by establishing regulations which limit the area that certain kinds of outdoor lighting fixtures can illuminate.

CHAPTER 18.45 - PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS 

18.45.010: - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to: 
(1)  Encourage imaginative design and the creation of permanent open space by permitting greater flexibility in zoning requirements than is generally permitted by other sections of the Kennewick Municipal Code ("KMC"); 
(2)  Preserve or create environmental amenities superior to those generally found in conventional developments; 
(3)  Create or preserve usable open space for the enjoyment of the residents; 
(4)  Preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the natural characteristics of the land, including, but not limited to, topography, natural vegetation, waterways, and views; 
(5)  Encourage development of a variety of housing types; and 
(6)  Provide for maximum efficiency in the layout of streets, utility networks and other public improvements and infrastructure. 
(Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
18.45.020: - Where Permitted. 
    Planned residential developments (PRDs) are permitted in all residential zoning districts in the City. 
(Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
18.45.030: - Permitted Uses. 
    The following uses are permitted in a PRD; provided that they meet the standards and criteria established in this chapter: 
(1)  Those uses permitted as a matter of right in the underlying zoning district; 
(2)  Residential developments of all types as defined by this chapter; and 
(3)  As a secondary use, uses permitted in the Commercial Neighborhood (CN) zoning district may be permitted in a PRD of 20 acres or larger. 
(Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
18.45.040: - Relationship of this Section to other KMC Provisions. 
(1)  Zoning Requirements. The provisions of Title 18 pertaining to land use of the underlying zoning district shall govern the use of land in a PRD. The specific setback, lot size, height limits and other dimensional requirements are waived and the regulations for PRDs shall be those indicated in KMC 18.45.050; 
(2)  Platting Requirements. A PRD shall be exempt from the specific design requirements of the Subdivision Ordinance (KMC Title 17), except that when any parcel of land in a PRD is intended for individual ownership, sale or public dedication, the subdivision and procedural requirements of the Subdivision Ordinance (KMC Title 17) and applicable state laws pertaining to subdivisions and conveyance of land and the preparation of maps shall be followed; 
(3)  Public Hearing Required. A PRD shall require a public hearing before the hearing examiner consistent with the provisions of KMC Chapter 4.12. 
(Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
18.45.050: - Development Standards. 
    The following standards shall govern the administration of this chapter: 
(1)  Relationship of PRD Site to Adjacent Areas. The design of a PRD shall take into account the relationship of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the PRD shall be so designed as to minimize adverse impact of the PRD on adjacent properties and, conversely, to minimize adverse impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the PRD; 
(2)  Site Acreage Minimum. The minimum site shall be five acres; 
(3)  Minimum Lot Size. The minimum lot size provisions of other sections of the KMC do not apply in a PRD, except that the maximum density of the underlying zone shall serve as the criterion to calculate the total number of dwelling units allowed in the proposed PRD; 
(4)  Density. In a PRD, the hearing examiner may authorize a dwelling unit density not more than 20 percent greater than that permitted by the underlying zone, rounded to the nearest whole number, provided, that the open space amenities described in KMC 18.45.060 are met; 
(5)  Landscaping Required. All common open space shall be landscaped in accordance with the landscaping plan submitted by the applicant and approved by the hearing examiner. Natural landscape features which are preserved, such as existing trees, drainage ways, rock outcrops, etc., may be accepted as part of the landscaping plan. 
(6)  Setback and Side Yard Requirements. 
(a)  Setbacks from the exterior boundary line of the PRD area shall be comparable to or compatible with those of the existing development of adjacent properties, or, if adjacent properties are undeveloped, the type of development which may reasonably be expected on such properties given the existing zoning of such properties or the Comprehensive Plan and/or adopted subarea plans; 
(b)  Setbacks or Side Yards between Buildings. The standard setbacks and yard requirements between buildings may be waived in a PRD. Buildings may have common walls and, therefore, be built to the property line as in townhome construction; however, all buildings must meet applicable building code requirements. 
(7)  All streets shall be designed and constructed to public street standards, unless deviations are approved by the Public Works Director; 
(8)  Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with KMC 18.36; 
(9)  Outdoor lighting shall be in accordance with KMC 18.39; 
(10)  Secondary Use Limitations. 
(a)  Commercial uses are subject to site plan review procedures and shall be provided for in the application for the development within which the commercial use is to be integrated; 
(b)  The gross floor area of the commercial use shall not exceed the product of 50 square feet multiplied by the number of dwelling units within the development; 
(c)  Construction of at least 35 percent of the residences in the PRD must be completed before any building permits will be issued for the construction of commercial uses, except this shall not prohibit a sales office; and 
(d)  Commercial uses within a PRD shall be of a size and type to serve primarily the residents of the development, and shall be internally located to fulfill this function. 
(Ord. 5609 Sec. 1, 2015; Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
18.45.060: - Open Space Standards. 
    Each PRD shall dedicate not less than 15 percent of the gross land area for common open space for the use of its residents. Common open space areas shall meet the following criteria: 
(1)  Location. The area proposed for the open space shall be entirely within the PRD and within reasonable walking distance of all dwelling units in the PRD. Where practical, the proposed common open space shall be located adjacent to other established or planned park and recreational areas in adjacent developments, schools, or City parks; provided that such dedication would increase the overall benefit to the residents of the PRD and conform to other criteria in this section; 
(2)  Access. All dwelling units within the PRD must have legal access to the proposed common open space at the time of final PRD approval. Private or access roads, trees or other landscaping may separate the common open space area. However, access should not be blocked by major obstacles such as arterial or collector roadways or significant natural features such as rivers, streams or topographic features. Areas dedicated for active recreational open space shall have reasonable access from street frontages. Design measures should accomplish the purpose of access and security; 
(3)  Proposals for credits towards required City park impact fees may be submitted for review per KMC 3.90.080; 
(4)  Types of Open Space. 
(a)  Land dedicated for open space should be usable for either greenbelts that serve as a buffer between land uses, using existing vegetation, or an aesthetic amenity such as boulevard trees, active recreational activities, or for protecting environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands; 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection (5)(c) or (d) below, a minimum of 30 percent of the required dedicated open space shall be suitable for active recreation. The topography, soils, hydrology, and other physical characteristics of the area proposed for active recreation shall be of such quality as to provide a dry, obstacle-free space in a configuration which is suitable for active recreation; 
(c)  The percentage of active recreational areas may be increased to as high as 50 percent if it is determined that anticipated recreational needs will require a larger percentage. In increasing this percentage, the following standard should be used: the ratio of one acre to 125 residential units; 
(d)  The percentage of active recreational area may be decreased to as low as zero if it is determined that: 
(i)  Inclusion of buffers or environmentally sensitive lands such as wetlands would better meet the open space needs of the residents of the subdivision; or 
(ii)  Meeting the standard would require detrimental grading or other disturbance of the natural setting. 
(5)  Land required for open space shall not include: 
(a)  Structures and areas reserved for the exclusive use and benefit of an individual tenant or owner; 
(b)  Dedicated streets, alleys or public rights-of-way, required landscape areas, areas required for yard depth or building setback or separation; 
(c)  Vehicular driveways, private streets, parking areas, loading or storage areas; or 
(d)  Floodplain (100-year), floodprone areas, drainage easements, natural drainage areas or creeks unless maintained as an amenity and specifically approved as being suitable for open space. 
(6)  Implementation. 
(a)  The area proposed for open space shall be dedicated in common to the lot owners within the plat or to a homeowner's association. Maintenance and operation of the dedicated open space shall be the responsibility of the property owners' or homeowners' association; 
(b)  The City may choose to accept dedication, maintenance and operation responsibilities when common open space area to be dedicated is in the public interest and either one or a combination of the following: 
(i)  Greater than five acres; 
(ii)  Adjacent to an established or future City park or school grounds; 
(iii)  Is an environmentally sensitive area; or 
(iv)  The City feels it is in the public interest to accept dedications; 
(c)  The dedication shall be identified on the PRD plan. 
(7)  Improvements. The following improvements to the area proposed for dedication may be required prior to final approval of the PRD: 
(a)  Removal of construction debris and hazards; and 
(b)  Rough grading and establishment of grass cover over those portions of the site suitable for playfields. 
(8)  Equivalent Facilities. When areas proposed for dedication do not meet the criteria for dedication in this chapter, such land may be improved by grading, filling, landscaping, or with installation of recreation equipment so as to be equivalent in result to the intent of this chapter. Determination of equivalency shall be made by the director according to the following guidelines: 
(a)  The proposed land and improvements must create recreational opportunities generally equivalent to, or greater than, the land required for the residents within the PRD; 
(b)  The proposed land and improvements must not result in significant disturbance or alteration of an environmentally sensitive area, unless otherwise allowed by the City; 
(c)  The proposed land and improvements shall be dedicated in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. 
(9)  Stormwater Detention Facilities. Stormwater detention ponds may be allowed by the City as part of dedicated open space subject to the following criteria: 
(a)  The detention pond shall be constructed so as to drain fully when precipitation is not occurring (i.e., no standing water may be left) unless the pond is designed as an aesthetic amenity; 
(b)  The side slope of the detention pond shall not exceed 33 percent unless slopes are existing, natural, and covered with vegetation; 
(c)  If detention facilities are located adjacent to or near a natural, year-round stream or wetland, these systems shall be left in natural or near-natural condition; 
(d)  The detention area shall be landscaped in a manner which is both aesthetic and able to withstand the inundation expected; 
(e)  Use of a dedicated open space area for stormwater detention shall not be acceptable if the detention area must be fenced or otherwise rendered unsuitable or unavailable for recreation use during dry weather; and 
(f)  In the case of joint use of open space for detention and recreation, the homeowners or homeowners' association shall be responsible for maintenance of the detention facilities. 
(10)  Rights and Duties. The owners of open space shall have the following rights which may be exercised in respect of such land, subject to restrictive covenants or other restrictions: 
(a)  The right to locate recreational facilities, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, picnic tables, and fireplaces (accessory to picnic tables) designed to be used exclusively for the use of residents of the development and their guests; 
(b)  The right to locate pedestrian paths, bicycle paths and bridle paths; 
(c)  The right to take whatever measures are reasonably necessary to protect and maintain such land, or land or property thereto, or to correct a hazardous condition posing a threat to life or limb; 
(d)  The right to regulate access to or entry on the open space land and duty to maintain such land. 
( Ord. 5768, Sec. 1, 2018 ; Ord. 5609 Sec. 1, 2015; Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013)

(2)  Minor and Major Adjustments. 
(a)  Minor adjustments may be made and approved by the director when a building permit is issued. Minor adjustments are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement of buildings approved in the final plan, nor the density of the development or the open space requirements. Such dimensional adjustments shall not vary more than ten percent from the original; 
(b)  Major adjustments are those which, in the opinion of the director, substantially change the basic design, density, open space or other requirements of the PRD.

(Ord. 5501 Sec. 1(part), 2013) 
CHAPTER 18.48 - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 

18.48.010: - Findings. 
    The City Council finds that the lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in a waste of public and private resources, escalate housing costs for consumers and discourage the commitment to comprehensive planning which would make maximum efficient use of resources at the least economic cost to the public. Assurance to a development project applicant that upon government approval the project may proceed in accordance with existing policies and regulations, and subject to conditions of approval, all as set forth in a development agreement, will strengthen the public planning process, encourage private participation and comprehensive planning, and reduce the economic costs of development. Further, the lack of public facilities and services is a serious impediment to development of new housing and commercial uses. Project applicants and the City may include provisions and agreements whereby applicants are reimbursed over time for financing public facilities. 
(Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.48.020: - Development Contract Authorized. 
(1)  The City may enter into a development agreement with a person having ownership or control of real property within its jurisdiction. The City may enter into a development agreement for real property outside its boundaries as part of a proposed annexation or a service agreement. A development agreement must set forth the development standards and other provisions that shall apply to and govern and vest the development, use, and mitigation of the development of the real property for the duration specified in the agreement. A development agreement shall be consistent with all applicable development regulations.

The Planning Director will report any application for a Building Permit to work on a designated Register property to the Commission. He will not issue any such Building Permit until a Certificate of Appropriateness or waiver is received from the Commission. 
(b)  Commission Review. The owner or his agent (architect, contractor, lessee, etc.) must apply to the Commission for a review of proposed changes on a Register property and request a Certificate of Appropriateness or, in the case of demolition, a waiver. Each application for review of proposed changes must be accompanied by such information as is required by the Commission for the proper review of the proposed project. The Commission will meet with the applicant and review the proposed work according to the design review criteria established in its rules. Unless legally required, there will be no notice, posting, or publication for action on the application, but all such actions will be made at regular meetings of the Commission. The Commission will complete its review and make its recommendations within 30 days of the date of receipt of the application. If the Commission is unable to process the request, it may ask for an extension of time. If the applicant does not consent to an extension, the request may be denied. The Commission's recommendations will be in writing and state the findings of fact and reasons relied upon in reaching its decision. Any conditions agreed to by the applicant in this review process will become conditions of approval of the permit. If the owner agrees to the Commission's recommendations, a Certificate of Appropriateness will be awarded by the Commission according to standards established in the Commission's rules. The Commission's recommendations and, if awarded, the Certificate of Appropriateness will be transmitted to the Director. If a Certificate of Appropriateness is awarded, the Planning Director will then issue the permit. 
(4)  Demolition. A waiver of the Certificate of Appropriateness is required before a permit can be issued to allow whole or partial demolition of a designated Register property. The owner or agent must apply to the Commission for a review of the proposed demolition and request a waiver. The applicant must meet with the Commission in an attempt to find alternatives to demolition. These negotiations may last no longer than 45 days from the initial meeting of the Commission, unless either party requests an extension. If no request for an extension is made and no alternative to demolition has been agreed to, the Commission will act on the approval or denial of the waiver of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Conditions in the case of granting a demolition permit may include allowing the Commission up to 45 additional days to develop alternatives to demolition. When issuing a Waiver, the Commission may require the owner to mitigate the loss of the Register property by means determined by the Commission. Any conditions agreed to by the applicant in this review process will become conditions of approval of the permits granted. After the property is demolished the Commission will remove the property from the Register.

(VII)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(VIII)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(IX)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(X)  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
(ii)  Maintenance: 
(I)  Buildings and structures shall not be allowed to deteriorate beyond the point where routine maintenance and repair will return them to good condition. 
(II)  Buildings shall be kept in a safe and habitable condition at all times. Structural defects and hazards shall be corrected. Any condition which constitutes a fire hazard shall be eliminated. 
(III)  Buildings shall be protected against ongoing water damage due to defective roofing, flashing, glazing, caulking or other causes. Moisture condensation resulting from inadequate heat or ventilation shall be eliminated if present at levels sufficient to promote rot or decay of building materials. 
(IV)  Deteriorated exterior architectural features and any broken or missing doors and windows shall be repaired or replaced. 
(V)  Painted exterior surfaces shall be maintained and repainted as necessary to prevent a deteriorated appearance or damage to the substrate. Exterior masonry surfaces shall be tuck-pointed where required to maintain the mortar in good condition. Finished tuck-pointing shall match the original mortar joint in hardness and appearance. 
(4)  Agreement. The owner and Commission shall execute and record a contract complying with RCW 84.26.050(2). 
(Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007)

(a)  Maintain a critical areas designation certification program for wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas by periodically updating these maps with new information as it is provided to the City. Currently, the City has two types of boundaries depicted on the wetlands, and the fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas maps: 
(i)  Certified - Where the critical area boundary has been verified and mapped within the past five years by a qualified professional (e.g. delineated wetland), hydrology of the site (applicable to wetlands only) has not been altered within that time period, and this territorial limit information has been provided to the City. Certified wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat as of 2007 include: Elliott Lake wetlands, 27th Avenue wetlands, Zintel Canyon, 36th Avenue wetland; wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat in Columbia Park, and the large contiguous block of shrub steppe habitat located adjacent to HWY 395 and Interstate I-82 on the southern portion of the City and its urban growth boundary. 
(ii)  Uncertified - Where more specific information needs to be prepared by a qualified professional and provided to the City to accurately show the boundary of a given critical area, or where boundaries and conditions of certified wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat is more than five years old and needs to be verified. 
(b)  The most recent map revision identifying certified and uncertified wetlands and fish and wildlife conservation areas becomes the map of record for demonstrating compliance with the state requirement for designating and classifying these critical areas. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.58.110: - Allowed Activities. 
(1)  Process. The Planning Director shall allow activities that are verified to comply with this section. The Planning Director shall provide a copy of this section, including any future updates, and the maps of critical area designations to city departments and other potential affected agencies as determined by the Planning Director. City Departments and other local agencies when conducting allowed activities (except for 18.58.110(3)(c) and (d)), will notify the Planning Director in writing in advance of the planned activity, when it will occur, and steps that will be taken to comply with the provisions of this Title. Emergency activities or any other activities that occur without advance notice will be followed up with a report to the Planning Director describing how provisions of this Title are being met. Documentation of allowed activities shall be maintained on file at the Planning Department. 
(2)  Allowed Activities shall Avoid Impacts to Critical Areas. All allowed activities shall use mitigation sequencing to avoid potential impacts to critical areas, using best management practices that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas where practicable. Designation as an allowed activity does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Best management practices shall be used for tree and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, fish and wildlife protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The City shall monitor the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party's expense within one growing season. 
(3)  Allowed Activities. The following developments, activities, and associated uses are allowed and shall be exempt from the provisions of this Title except as noted in provisions below, provided that they are otherwise consistent with the provisions of other local, state, and federal laws and requirements: 
(a)  Emergencies. Emergency activities are those activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or that pose an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or preventative action in a timeframe too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of this Title. 
Emergency actions that create an impact to a critical area or its buffer shall use "reasonable methods" to address the emergency; in addition, they must have the least possible impact to the critical area or its buffer. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the City within one working day following commencement of the emergency activity. Within 30 days, the Planning Director shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed in this Subsection. If the Planning Director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then enforcement provisions of Section 18.58.190 shall apply. 
After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with the critical area report or other applicable information, and mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for review, and the alteration, critical area report or other applicable information, and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the City in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Restoration and/or mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency, and completed in a timely manner; 
(b)  Operation, Maintenance or Repair. Operation, maintenance or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees or drainage systems, that do not require a permit or are covered under a programmatic permit from an authorized agency, if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to, or encroach further within, the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance, or repair; 
(c)  Passive Outdoor Activities. Recreation, education, and scientific research activities that do not degrade the critical area, including fishing, hiking, and bird watching. 
(d)  Permit Requests Subsequent to Previous Critical Area Review. Development permits and approvals that involve both discretionary land use approvals (such as subdivisions, rezones, or conditional use permits), and construction approvals (such as building permits) if all of the following conditions have been met: 
(i)  The provisions of this Title have been previously addressed as part of another approval; 
(ii)  There have been no material changes in the potential impact to the critical area or buffer since the prior review; 
(iii)  There is no new information available that is applicable to any critical area review of the site or particular critical area; 
(iv)  The permit or approval has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years has elapsed since the issuance of that permit or approval; and 
(v)  Compliance with any standards or conditions placed upon the prior permit or approval has been achieved or secured. 
(e)  Modification to Existing Structures. Structural modification of, addition to, or replacement of an existing legally constructed structure that does not further alter or increase the impact to the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed modification or replacement, provided that restoration of structures substantially damaged by fire, flood, or act of nature must be initiated within six months of the date of such damage, as evidenced by the issuance of a valid building permit, and diligently pursued to completion; 
(f)  Activities within the Improved Right-Of-Way. Replacement, modification, installation, or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment, or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-way or a City authorized private roadway except those activities that alter a wetland or watercourse, such as culverts or bridges, or results in the transport of sediment or increased stormwater; 
(g)  Public and Private Pedestrian Trails. Public and private pedestrian trails not in wetlands, or fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, where the trail surface meets all other requirements; 
(h)  Select Vegetation Removal Activities. Select vegetation removal activities are allowed upon review and approval of the Director. Accepted vegetation removal activities include: a) removing and controlling invasive plants or noxious weeds; b) removal of trees that are hazardous, posing a threat to public safety, or posing an imminent risk of damage to private property and measures to control a fire or halt the spread of disease or damaging insects consistent with the State Forest Practices Act, Chapter 76.09 RCW. Unless otherwise provided or as a necessary part of an approved alteration, removal of any vegetation or woody debris from a habitat conservation area or wetland shall be prohibited; 
(i)  Chemical Applications. The application of herbicides, pesticides, organic or mineral-derived fertilizers, or other hazardous substances, if necessary, provided that their use shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal law. (More information on commercial and residential use of chemicals can be found in Department of Ecology "Guidance Document for Establishment of Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas Ordinances" Version 3.0, Publication #97-30; and from the state Department of Agriculture, http://www.wa.gov/agr/); 
(j)  Minor Site Investigative Work. Work necessary for land use submittals, such as topographic surveys, soil logs, percolation tests, and other related activities, where such activities do not require construction of new roads or significant amounts of excavation. In every case, impacts to the critical area shall be minimized and disturbed areas shall be immediately restored; and 
(k)  Navigational Aids and Boundary Markers. Construction or modification of navigational aids and boundary markers. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 1, 2007)

(d)  Determine whether the proposed project is likely to impact the functions or values of critical areas; and 
(e)  Determine if the proposed project adequately addresses the impacts and avoids impacts to the critical area associated with the project. 
(2)  Critical Areas Present, but No-Impact Waiver. If the Planning Director determines that there are critical areas within or adjacent to the project area, but that the proposed activity is unlikely to degrade the functions or values of the critical area, the Planning Director may waive the requirement for a report or other applicable information. If the waiver involves a wetland, the Planning Director may require a wetland category rating be completed prior to determining whether a waiver can be granted. A waiver may be granted if there is substantial evidence that all of the following requirements will be met: 
(a)  There will be no alteration of the critical area or buffer; 
(b)  The development proposal will not impact the critical area in a manner contrary to the purpose, intent, and requirements of this Title; and 
(c)  The proposal is consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.

(Ord. 5206 Sec. 1, 2007) 
CHAPTER 18.59 - CRITICAL AREAS - WETLANDS 

18.59.010: - Designation, Rating and Mapping Wetlands. 
(1)  Designating Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas, designated in accordance with the Washington State Wetland Identification and Delineation Manual, that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. All areas within the City of Kennewick meeting the wetland designation criteria in the Identification and Delineation Manual, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Title. 
(2)  Wetland Ratings. Wetland Types I-IV shall be rated according to the Department of Ecology wetland rating system found in the Washington State Wetland Rating for Eastern Washington, (Ecology Publication #04-06-15). This document contains definitions and methods for determining if specific criteria are met by a particular wetland. The City of Kennewick contains few wetland areas and most of these have been subject to disturbance in the past. The City has evaluated the most significant wetland areas that are known within the City Limits and its urban growth boundary under the Ecology Rating System. These include: the wetlands associated with Elliot Lake, Zintel Canyon drainage way, wetlands around 36th and Olympia, and 27th and Washington; and wetlands within Columbia Park and the Columbia River shoreline zone, including Duffy's Pond near Clover Island. These wetlands all classify as Category III Wetlands. This effort leads the City to believe that any additional wetlands that may occur within the City limits will rank as Category III Wetlands or as Category IV wetlands and that it is unlikely that higher quality wetlands occur in the City of Kennewick. Provisions have been provided for Category I and II wetlands, should there be a future determination these exist in Kennewick. 
The Ecology Wetland Rating System for Eastern Washington (Ecology 2004) defines Category III wetlands as those wetlands that are: 1) vernal pools that are isolated, and 2) wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between 30 and 50 points); and Category IV wetlands are considered to be wetlands that have the lowest level of functions (scores less than 30 points) and are often heavily disturbed. 
(3)  Mapping. The approximate location and extent of known wetlands are shown on the adopted critical area map (Exhibit 1, or the latest revision of this map). This information is to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants and/or property owners, and may be updated as new information becomes available. In some instances (uncertified boundaries), it is a reference and does not provide a final critical area designation. 
The exact location of a wetland's boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified professional applying the Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual as required by RCW 36.70A.175 (Ecology Publication #96-94). 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 2, 2007) 
18.59.020: - Activities Allowed in Wetlands. 
    The activities listed below are allowed in wetlands in addition to those activities listed in, and consistent with, the provisions established in Section 18.58.110, and do not require submission of a critical area report, except where such activities result in the loss to the functions and values of a wetland or wetland buffer. These activities include: 
(1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure, or functions of the existing wetland. 
(2)  The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions or water sources. 
(3)  Boat mooring. 
(4)  Recreational and educational activities. 
(5)  Research. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 2, 2007) 
18.59.030: - Wetlands-Additional Requirements. 
(1)  Prepared by a Qualified Professional. A qualified professional shall prepare a critical areas report for wetlands. The City shall determine whether a person is a qualified professional based on criteria established in WAC 395-195-905(4). 
(2)  Area Addressed in Critical Area Report. The following areas shall be addressed in a critical area report for wetlands: 
(a)  The project area of the proposed activity; 
(b)  All wetlands and recommended buffers within 200 feet of the project area (critical area reports should consider wetlands and other critical areas within 200 feet due to the maximum potential buffer recommended for wetlands); and 
(c)  All shoreline areas, water features, floodplains, and other critical areas, and related buffers within 200 feet of the project area. 
(3)  Wetland Analysis. In addition the minimum required contents of critical area reports in Section 18.58.140 and 18.58.150, a critical area report for wetlands shall contain an analysis of the wetlands including the following site and proposal-related information at a minimum: 
(a)  A written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within 200 feet of the project area, or one-half mile upstream or downstream if the wetland is a riverine wetland, including the following information at a minimum: 
(i)  Wetland delineation and required buffers; 
(ii)  Existing wetland acreage; 
(iii)  Wetland category; vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics; 
(iv)  Soil and substrate conditions; and 
(b)  A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing wetlands and restore any wetlands that were degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity. 
(c)  Proposed mitigation, if needed, including a written assessment and accompanying maps of the mitigation area, including the following information at a minimum: 
(i)  Existing wetland acreage and proposed impact area;

(4)  Additional Information May be Required. When appropriate, the City may also require the critical area report to include an evaluation by the Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant's analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 2, 2007) 
18.59.040: - Performance Standards-General Requirements. 
(1)  Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas. 
(2)  Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this Title. 
(3)  Wetland buffers. 
(a)  Standard Buffer Widths. The standard buffer widths are based on wetland category, intensity of impacts, and wetland functions or special characteristics. The buffer is to be vegetated with native plant communities that are appropriate for the site conditions. If vegetation in the buffer is disturbed (grazed or mowed) proponents planning changes to land that will increase impacts to wetlands need to rehabilitate the buffer with native plant communities that are appropriate for the site conditions. The width of the buffer is measured in horizontal distance.

(b)  Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and the proposed land use. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 2, 2007) 
18.59.050: - Performance Standards-Mitigation Requirements. 
    When the acreage required for compensatory mitigation is divided by the acreage of impact, the result is a number known variously as a replacement, compensation, or mitigation ratio. Compensatory mitigation ratios are used to help ensure that compensatory mitigation actions are adequate to offset unavoidable wetland impacts by requiring a greater amount of mitigation area than the area of impact. Requiring greater mitigation area helps compensate for the risk that a mitigation action will fail and for the time lag that occurs between the wetland impact and achieving a fully functioning mitigation site. 
(1)  Definitions of Types of Compensatory Mitigation. The ratios presented are based on the type of compensatory mitigation proposed (e.g., restoration, creation, and enhancement). In its Regulatory Guidance Letter 02-02, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided definitions for these types of compensatory mitigation. For consistency, the authors of this document use the same definitions which are provided under Compensatory Mitigation in Section 18.58.010. 
Table 4: Mitigation Ratios For Projects in Kennewick Category and Type of Wetland Impacts Re-establishment or Creation Rehabilitation Only 4 Re-establishment or Creation (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH) Re-establishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E) 4 Enhancement Only 4 All Category IV 1.5:1 3:1 1:1 R/C and 1:1 RH 1:1 R/C and 2:1 E 6:1 All Category III 2:1 4:1 1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH 1:1 R/C and 4:1 E 8:1 All Category II and I 4:1 8:1 1:1 R/C and 2:1 RH 1:1 R/C and 8:1 E 10:1  
4 These ratios are based on the assumption that the rehabilitation or enhancement actions implemented represent the average degree of improvement possible for the site. Proposals to implement more effective rehabilitation or enhancement actions may result in a lower ratio, while less effective actions may result in a higher ratio. The distinction between rehabilitation and enhancement is not clear-cut. Instead, rehabilitation and enhancement actions span a continuum. Proposals that fall within the gray area between rehabilitation and enhancement will result in a ratio that lies between the ratios for rehabilitation and the ratios for enhancement. 
(2)  Mitigation Maintenance and Monitoring. Mitigation areas will be maintained and monitored for a minimum of five years after the mitigation has been completed. Annual maintenance and monitoring reports will be submitted to the City and shall include: 
(a)  Descriptive data for vegetation, soils, and hydrology; 
(b)  Itemized list of dead, dying, and replaced vegetation; 
(c)  Quantitative assessment of invasive species; 
(d)  Descriptive photographs; 
(e)  Statement of overall success of mitigation; 
(f)  Schedule of activities for the next year of maintenance and monitoring. 
The City may extend maintenance and monitoring for mitigation projects that fail to achieve performance standards outlined in the mitigation plan. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 2, 2007) 
18.59.060: - Performance Standards-Specific Activities and Uses. 
    The following activities may be permitted within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this Title; provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland: 
(1)  Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife; 
(2)  Passive Recreation. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with the critical area report, including:

(b)  Wildlife viewing structures; and 
(c)  Fishing areas accessed by foot. 
(3)  Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands. Stormwater management facilities, limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales, may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only, provided that: 
(a)  No other location is feasible; and 
(b)  The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland. 
(4)  Subdivisions. The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following: 
(a)  Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided; 
(b)  Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be divided provided that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is: 
(i)  Located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and 
(ii)  Meets the minimum lot size requirements of the City zoning code (Title 18). 
(c)  Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the City determines that no other feasible alternative exists in and when consistent with this Title.

CHAPTER 18.60 - CRITICAL AREAS - CRITICAL AQUIFER RECHARGE AREAS 

18.60.010: - Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas Designation. 
    Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARA) are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). CARA has prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water. The following areas have been identified based on local conditions: 
(1)  Wellhead Protection Areas. Wellhead protection areas shall be defined by the boundaries of the ten-year time of ground water travel, or boundaries established using alternate criteria approved by the Department of Health in those settings where ground water time of travel is not a reasonable delineation criterion, in accordance with WAC 246-290-135.

CHAPTER 18.61 - CRITICAL AREAS-FREQUENTLY FLOODED AREAS 

18.61.010: - Classification. 
    The flood areas in the City of Kennewick are classified as either one of two types: 
(1)  Floodway: Floodways are defined as the channel of a stream and adjacent land areas which are required to carry and discharge the flood water or flood flows of any river or stream associated with a regulatory flood. 
(2)  Flood Fringe: The flood fringe is defined as that land area which is outside a stream's floodway, but is subject to periodic inundation due to flooding, associated with a regulatory flood. 
    These flood areas have been accurately delineated based on hydrologic and hydraulic studies completed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in 1981, and as subsequently revised and amended. 
    The methodology and detail of these studies is accepted as the best available. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 4, 2007) 
18.61.020: - Designation. 
(1)  All areas within the City meeting the frequently flooded designation criteria in the Identification and Delineation Manual, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Title. 
(2)  The approximate location and extent of frequently flooded areas are shown on the adopted Critical Areas Map (Exhibit 3, or the latest revision of this map). Maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as part of the National Flood Insurance Program (completed May, 1981; last revised June 15, 1994), clearly delineate frequently flooded areas. The present boundaries of the floodway and 100-year floodplain are those designated on the flood boundary and floodway maps contained in the Federal Emergency Management Agency report entitled, "Flood Insurance Study - City of Kennewick, Washington" (completed May, 1981; last revised June 15, 1994) and areas of special flood hazard outlined on the City of Kennewick Zoning Map. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 4, 2007) 
18.61.030: - Regulation. 
    Title 15 (Buildings and Construction) and Chapter 18.66 (Flood Damage Protection) of the City of Kennewick Code regulate proposed activities adjacent to or within frequently flooded areas. If allowed, any structures permitted in the designated flood areas are subject to the floodproofing regulations provided in Title 15 and Chapter 18.66. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 4, 2007) 
CHAPTER 18.62 - CRITICAL AREAS-GEOLOGICALLY HAZARDOUS AREAS 

18.62.010: - Designation of Geologically Hazardous Areas. 
    Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area (See WAC 365-190-080(4)(a)): 
(1)  Erosion hazard; 
(2)  Landslide hazard; 
(3)  Seismic hazard; 
(4)  Extreme slope hazard; 
(5)  Other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 5, 2007) 
18.62.020: - Designation of Specific Hazard Areas. 
(1)  Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) as having a "moderate to severe," "severe," or "very severe" rill and inter-rill erosion hazard (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(c). Rill erosion tends to occur on slopes, particularly steep slopes with easily-erodable soils or poor vegetation. Erosion hazard areas also include those areas with slope greater than 15 percent. 
(2)  Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Example of these may include, but are not limited to the following: 
(a)  Areas of historic failures, such as (see WAC 365-190-070(4)(d)(i)): 
(i)  Those areas delineated by the USDA-NRCS as having a "severe" limitation for building site development for factors other than slope for one or more types of building development; 
(ii)  Those areas mapped by the Department of Ecology (Coastal Zone Atlas) or the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable ("U" or class 3), unstable old slides ("UOS" or class 4), or unstable recent slides ("URS" or class 5); or 
(iii)  Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources; 
(b)  Areas with all three of the following characteristics (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(d)(ii)): 
(i)  Slopes steeper than 15 percent; and 
(ii)  Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and 
(iii)  Springs or ground water seepage; 
(c)  Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(d)(iv)); 
(d)  Slopes having gradients steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking (see WAC 365-190-080(4(d)(v)); 
(e)  Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(d)(vi)); 
(f)  Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(d)(vii)); and 
(g)  Any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of ten or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least ten feet of vertical relief (see WAC 365-190-080(4)(d)(ix)). 
(3)  Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by (see WAC 365-180-080(4)(e)): 
(a)  The magnitude of an earthquake; 
(b)  The distance from the source of an earthquake; 
(c)  The type of thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and 
(d)  The type of subsurface geologic structure. 
Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow ground water table. 
(4)  Extreme Slope Hazard Areas. Extreme slope hazard areas have severe erosion potential and a high probability of slope failure and landslide occurrence. 
(5)  Other Hazard Areas. Geologically hazardous areas shall also include areas determined by the Planning Director to be susceptible to other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 5, 2007) 
18.62.030: - Classification of Geologically Hazardous Areas. 
    The level of risk for each geologic hazard type is described in this section. Documentation of specific areas in which a known or suspected risk exists for each of the following hazard areas is provided in the City Critical Areas Map (see Exhibit 4: Geologically Hazardous Areas). The provisions of this Title apply only to those areas for which a known or suspected risk exists. 
Classification Documentation and Data Sources Known or Suspected Risk Documentation or projection of the hazard by a qualified professional exists. Low or No Risk Documentation exists by a qualified professional regarding low hazard risk or lack of hazard. Risk Unknown Documentation, data, or projection of the hazard risk by a qualified professional are not available or sufficient to determine the presence or absence of a geologic hazard.  
(1)  Erosion hazard areas - Known or suspected risk in steep areas. 
(2)  Landslide hazard areas - Known or suspected risk in areas with slope > 15 percent. 
(3)  Seismic hazard areas - Low or no risk. 
(4)  Extreme slope hazard areas - Known or suspected risk in areas with slope > 40 percent. 
(5)  Other hazard areas - Other geologically hazardous areas may be designated by the City if documentation thereof is available. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 5, 2007) 
18.62.040: - Mapping of Geologically Hazardous Areas. 
(1)  The approximate location and extent of geologically hazardous areas containing known or suspected risk are shown on the adopted Critical Areas Map (Exhibit 4, or latest version of this map). The hazard areas outlined on this map are based on the following data: 
(a)  USGS 10-meter Digital Elevation Model (slope); 
(b)  USDA Soil Survey of Benton County Area, Washington; 
(c)  Additional data as determined necessary by the City. 
(2)  This map is to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants and/or property owners, and may be updated as new information becomes available. It is a reference and does not provide a final critical area designation. 
(Ord. 5206 Sec. 5, 2007) 
18.62.050: - Activities Allowed in Geologically Hazardous Areas. 
    The following activities are allowed in geologically hazardous areas pursuant to Section 18.58.110, and do not require submission of a critical area report provided that the activity will not increase the risk of the hazard: 
(1)  Erosion and Landslide Hazard Areas. Except as otherwise provided for in this Title, only those activities approved and permitted consistent with the critical area report in accordance with this Title shall be allowed in erosion or landslide hazard areas. 
(2)  Extreme Slope Hazard Areas. Installation of fences may be allowed within an extreme slope hazard area. 
(3)  Other Hazard Areas. The following activities may be allowed within other geologically hazardous areas: 
(a)  Construction of new buildings with less than 3,500 square feet of floor area or roof area, whichever is greater, and which are not residential structures or used as places of employment or public assembly;

(b)  State Priority Habitats and Areas Associated With State Priority Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. A state list of priority habitats is included in Appendix A. 
(c)  Habitats and Species of Local Importance. Habitats and species of local importance are those identified by the City, including those that possess unusual or unique habitat warranting protection because of qualitative species diversity or habitat system health indicators (see map, Exhibit 1, or the latest revision of this map and Appendix A, both on file in the Kennewick Planning Department). 
(d)  Naturally Occurring Ponds Under 20 Acres. Naturally occurring ponds are those ponds under 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat, including those artificial ponds intentionally created from dry areas in order to mitigate impacts to ponds. Naturally occurring ponds do not include ponds deliberately designed and created from dry sites, such as canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, temporary construction ponds, and landscape amenities, unless such artificial ponds were intentionally created for mitigation. 
(e)  Waters of the State. Waters of the state includes lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16-031.

An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure used only for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements found in Section 18.66.060(2)(a). 
(21)  Manufactured Home is a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. 
(22)  Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision is a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
(23)  New Construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance. 
(24)  New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of adopted floodplain management regulations. 
(25)  Recreational Vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis; 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
(26)  Special Flood Hazard Area is an area subject to a base or 100-year flood; areas of special flood hazard are shown on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, VI-30, VE, or V. 
(27)  Start of Construction is the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement within 180 days after the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; the installation of streets or walkways; excavations for basements, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor the installation of accessory buildings, such as the garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(28)  Structure is a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
(29)  Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(30)  Substantial Improvement is any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. A "substantial improvement" occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not it affects the external dimensions of the structure. A "substantial improvement" does not include an improvement to comply with health, sanitary, or safety codes that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living or to a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
(31)  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this Chapter, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Chapter. 
(32)  Water Dependent means a structure for commerce or industry, which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operation.

18.66.030: - General Provisions. 
(1)  Lands to which this Chapter Applies. This Chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the City. It is an overlay zone imposed in addition to the provisions of the Zoning districts in which it is located. 
(2)  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a report entitled "Flood Insurance Study - City of Kennewick, Washington," completed in May, 1981, and revised in September of 1989, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and any revision thereto, is hereby adopted by reference. The Study and Maps are on file at the Department of Planning. Areas within Benton County which are annexed into the City, are within such areas, if shown upon studies and maps prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration for Benton County. Areas of special flood hazard will be shown on the Kennewick Zoning Map. 
(3)  Compliance. No structure or land may be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter. Violations of the provisions of this Chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction, be punished in accord with KMC 18.54. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Kennewick from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(4)  Greater Restriction Applies. This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. If this Chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, the more stringent prevails. 
(5)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions are minimum standards and liberally construed in favor of the City's regulatory powers; and deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
(6)  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of floodprotection established by this Chapter is reasonable for regulatory purposes and based on scientific and engineering research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter does not create liability on the part of the City of Kennewick, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision, or variance made thereunder. 
(Ord. 5309 Sec. 18, 2010; Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.66.040: - Administration. 
(1)  Development Permit Required. A Floodprone Area Development Permit must be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 18.66.030(2). The permit will be for all structures, including manufactured homes, as set forth in Section 18.66.020 and all other development including filling and other activities, also as set forth in Section 18.66.020. 
(2)  Application. Application for a development permit must be made on forms furnished by the Planning Director and include all information required for any other development application with which it may be filed. The application must include a copy of the construction drawings and elevations, in duplicate, of a site plan (one copy, if no larger than 81/2" x 14") drawn to scale and showing lot lines and dimensions of existing and proposed structures, landscaping, fences or walls, ground elevations of the area, proposed fill or grading, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and any other information deemed necessary by the Director. Specific information must show precisely the elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including a basement) of existing and proposed structures, the elevation, in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure has been floodproofed. A certificate by a professional engineer registered in the State of Washington that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section 18.66.060, and a description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated is required. 
(3)  Designation of the Director. The Planning Director shall administer and implement this Chapter. He or she may require proof that conditions of approval and the standards of this Chapter have been met or that certification be provided and, if not forthcoming, may revoke the development permit and require that development discontinue or the structure be vacated. When the first floor of a residential structure is required to be elevated, as provided in Section 18.66.060, the Planning Director will require that the applicant submit a statement from a professional surveyor indicating the elevation to which the first floor was actually constructed. 
(4)  Review. Duties and responsibilities of the Planning Director shall include, but not be limited to: 
(a)  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied. If they are located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 18.66.060(2)(f) are met and that all necessary permits have been obtained; 
(b)  Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State, or local government agencies from which prior approval is required (i.e. Section 404 wetlands permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers); 
(c)  If base flood elevation data has not been provided by the Flood Insurance Administration, in accordance with Section 18.66.030(2) basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, the Planning Director shall obtain, review and use any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Section 18.66.060(2) Specific Standards, and Section 18.66.060(2)(c) Floodways; 
(d)  Where base flood elevation is provided through the Flood Insurance Study or is required by this Chapter, obtain, record, and maintain the records of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, whether or not the structure contains a basement; and the floodproofing certification required in Section 18.66.060(2)(a) and (b), including the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level; 
(e)  For all new or substantially improved nonresidential floodproofed structures: Verify and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level, and maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 18.66.040(2); 
(f)  Alteration of Watercourses. Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, and require that the watercourse be maintained so that its flood carrying capacity is not diminished; 
(g)  Make interpretations where needed of the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions); 
(h)  If the conditions of this Chapter or any permit are not met, revoke the permit and cause the vacation or demolition of any nonconforming structure; and 
(i)  Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provision of this Chapter. 
(Ord. 5204 Sec. 17, 2007; Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.66.050: - Variance and Appeal Procedure. 
(1)  Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of the Planning Director and requests for variances. The procedure and requirements for a variance or appeal shall be in accord with Chapters 18.51 and 18.54. 
(2)  Consideration of the Hearing Examiner. 
(a)  In passing upon applications, the Hearing Examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and: 
(i)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(ii)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion; 
(iii)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the owner; 
(iv)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(v)  The necessity of a waterfront location to the facility, where applicable; 
(vi)  The availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(vii)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(viii)  The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program; 
(ix)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(x)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(xi)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(b)  Generally, variances may be issued for the new construction or substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the items in Section 18.66.050(2)(a) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification necessary for issuance of a variance increases. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  The Hearing Examiner may attach such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the remainder of this Section. 
(g)  Other variances may be approved by the Hearing Examiner upon: 
(i)  No increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result; 
(ii)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(iii)  There is good and sufficient cause for the granting of the variance; 
(iv)  A failure to grant the variance will result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
(v)  Granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws or ordinances; 
(vi)  Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants or their economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the Flood Hazard Regulations should be quite rare; 
(vii)  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except Section 18.66.050(2)(b), and otherwise complies with Section 18.66.060. 
(3)  Responsibilities of the Director. 
(a)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted will be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the costs of flood insurance may be commensurate with the increased risk. 
(b)  The Planning Director will maintain records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. 5322 Sec. 63, 2010; Ord. 5309 Sec. 19, 2010; Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.66.060: - Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction. 
(1)  General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards apply: 
(a)  Anchoring. 
(i)  All new construction and substantial improvements must be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. 
(ii)  All manufactured homes must be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by providing the over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Over-the-top ties must be provided at each of the four corners of the mobile home with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations, but mobile homes less than 50 feet long need have only one additional tie per side. Frame ties must be provided at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side. All components of the anchoring system must be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds. Any additions to the mobile home must be similarly anchored. 
(iii)  An alternative method of anchoring may be used provided it complies with the standards contained in FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebook; incorporated herein by reference. 
(b)  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvements must be constructed with materials and utility equipment and by methods and practices that resist and minimize flood damage. 
(c)  Mechanical Equipment and Utilities. 
(i)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(ii)  All new and replacement water supply systems must be designed to eliminate or minimize the infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(iii)  All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration from and discharge into floodwaters; 
(iv)  On-site waste disposal systems must be located and designed to avoid impairment or contamination during flooding; and 
(v)  Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway. 
(d)  Subdivision Proposals. 
(i)  All the subdivision proposals must have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, and adequate drainage located and constructed which will minimize flood damage. 
(ii)  Base flood elevation data must be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
(e)  Review of Building Permits. The Planning Director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize the best available information as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone "A" conform to applicable provisions of this Chapter. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 18.66.040(4)(c)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Residential and commercial structures in unnumbered "A" Flood Hazard Zones must be elevated with their lowest floor at least two feet above grade. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in unnumbered "A" Zones may result in higher insurance rates. All applicants for building permits within special flood hazard areas are encouraged to elevate the lowest floor at least one foot above the base flood level. Elevating to at least one foot above the base flood will further substantially reduce the damage potential in the event of a 100-year flood; and, will have a lessening effect on the fees or rates for required flood insurance. 
(2)  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in Section 18.66.030(2) or 18.66.040(4)(d), the following standards apply: 
(a)  Residential Construction. 
(i)  New Construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a registered professional engineer or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(ii)  Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions be elevated so that either: the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation, or the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately designed foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(iii)  Residential structures that contain fully enclosed areas below the base flood level must meet the same standards for such areas as described in 18.66.060(2)(b)(i). 
(b)  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure must either have the lowest floor, including basement, and attendant utility and sanitary facilities, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; or floodproofed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, has structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy, be certified by a registered professional engineer that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications, and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 18.66.040(2). 
(i)  Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in Section 18.66.060(2)(a)(i). 
(ii)  Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (a building floodproofed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level). 
(c)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 18.66.030(2) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry debris, and increase erosion potential, the following provision apply: 
(i)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development; unless a registered, professional civil engineer certifies that the encroachments will not increase flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(ii)  Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways except for (1) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground flood area; and (2) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damaged occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure sale living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded in the 50 percent. 
(iii)  If Subsection (c)(i) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(d)  Standards for Shallow Flooding Areas (AO Zones). Shallow flooding areas appear on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply: 
(i)  New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(ii)  New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either: 
(I)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(II)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer. 
(iii)  Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(iv)  Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A, A1-30, and AE in the community's FIRM either must: be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or be fully licensed and ready for highway use, be on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or meet the requirements of Section 18.66.060(2)(a)(ii) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. 
(e)  Critical Facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) (100-year flood plain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation (100-year) at the site or to the height of the 500-year event, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Ingress and egress routs, elevated to or above the base flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(f)  Encroachments. The cumulative effect of any proposed development, where combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

CHAPTER 18.68 - SHORELINE MANAGEMENT 
To view the Shoreline Master Program Appendices use the following link: https://www.go2kennewick.com/DocumentCenter/View/215/1868-Shoreline-Mater-Program-Appendices 
PART I: - POLICY 

18.68.005: - Introduction. 
(1)  The City of Kennewick Shoreline Master Program intends to implement the requirements of the Washington State Shoreline Management Act (SMA) (Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 90.58). The SMA was enacted in 1971 to provide for the management and protection of shorelines of the State by regulating development in the shoreline area. The goal of the SMA is "to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the State's shorelines." The SMA requires cities and counties to adopt a Shoreline Master Program under rules established by the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) to regulate shoreline development and accommodate "all reasonable and appropriate uses" consistent with "protection against adverse effects to the public health, the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the waters of the State and their aquatic life... and public rights of navigation." The City of Kennewick adopted its Shoreline Master Program in 1974. Ecology adopted the 2003 Shoreline Management Act Guidelines (Chapter 173-26 Washington Administrative Code (WAC)) (Guidelines) which require local government review and updates of Shoreline Master Programs. 
(2)  The purpose of the Kennewick Shoreline Master Program is to be consistent with the SMA and corresponding guidelines, coordinate with the State Growth Management Act, protect, restore and enhance the City's environmental resources, offer public access and enjoyment of shorelines, and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by providing guidelines and regulations for the future development of the City's shoreline resources. 
(3)  The updated version of the Kennewick Shoreline Master Program provides goals, policies and regulations for the development of shorelines of Kennewick and acts as a regulatory tool for shoreline developments. The Kennewick Shoreline Master Program incorporates by reference the Shoreline Inventory and Assessment Report (2005), City of Kennewick Shoreline Restoration Plan (May 2009), and the City of Kennewick Shoreline Cumulative Impact Assessment Report (May 2009). Appendices such as the Kennewick Shoreline Critical Area Regulations (Appendix A-2) and the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6), along with all other appendices are also included in the Kennewick Shoreline Master Program. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.010: - Findings. 
(1)  Protection of private property rights consistent with the public interest associated with the shorelines of the State requires that local, state and federal governments concertedly use, protect, restore, enhance and preserve the shorelines as one of the State's most valuable and fragile natural resources. 
(2)  By enacting RCW 90.58 the legislature has established a method for accomplishing these purposes. Meeting these purposes is made more straightforward for the City of Kennewick Shoreline Master Program as nearly all the lands in the shoreline management area are publicly owned by the City, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the Port of Kennewick. 
(3)  This Chapter is intended to implement the provisions of Chapter 90.58 RCW and the implementation guidance provided in Chapters 173-26 and 173-27 WAC. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.020: - Statement of Applicability. 
(1)  All proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction of the City of Kennewick must conform to Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act, and this Shoreline Master Program. 
(2)  Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be applicable. The applicant is responsible for complying with all applicable requirements, apart from the process established in this Chapter. Where appropriate, the Planning Official will encourage use of information such as permit applications to other agencies or special studies prepared in response to other regulatory requirements to support required documentation submitted for review under this Chapter. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.030: - Severability. 
    If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this Chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such order or judgment shall be confined in its operation to the controversy in which it was rendered. The decision shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any part thereof and to this end the provisions of each clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this law are hereby declared to be severable. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.040: - Definitions. 
    As used in this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions and concepts apply: 
(1)  Applicant means a person who files an application for permit under this Chapter and who is the owner of the land on which the proposed activity would be located, a contract purchaser, or the authorized agent of such a person. 
(2)  Average Grade Level means the average of the natural or existing topography of the portion of the lot, parcel, or tract of real property which will be directly under the proposed building or structure. In the case of structures to be built over water, average grade level shall be the elevation of the ordinary high water mark.

The Legislature can change the dollar threshold at any time. 
(41)  Water-Dependent Use means a use or a portion of a use which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. Examples of water-dependent uses may include, but are not limited to, boat docks, boat fueling stations, instream structures, fishing, boat launching, swimming, and water intake and outfall discharges/pipes. 
(42)  Water-Enjoyment Use means a recreational use or other use that facilitates public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which through location, design, and operation ensures the public's ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. In order to qualify as a water-enjoyment use, the use must be open to the general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment (as defined in WAC 173-26-020). Water-enjoyment uses may include, but are not limited to:

18.68.050: - Special Policy Goals-Shorelines of Statewide Significance. 
    In recognition of the Columbia River, a Shoreline of Statewide Significance, the following Special Policy Goals listed in order of preference have been established for use in implementing the City's Shoreline Regulations. Preference shall be given to uses which: 
(1)  Recognize and protect state-wide interest over local interest; 
(2)  Preserve the natural character of the shoreline; 
(3)  Result in long-term over short-term benefit; 
(4)  Protect the resources and ecology of the shorelines; 
(5)  Maintain and enhance public access to the shorelines; 
(6)  Increase recreational opportunities for the public on the shorelines; 
(7)  Promote and enhance public interest; 
(8)  Protect public rights of navigation; 
(9)  Preserve and protect culturally significant features; and 
(10)  Provide, whenever feasible, all necessary accommodations to enhance the participation and enjoyment of persons with special needs. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.060: - Goals-Shoreline Development Elements. 
    The following goals have been developed in response to various elements of shoreline development and are provided to guide implementation of this Chapter: 
(1)  Economic Development Element. Encourage economic development, with emphasis on water-oriented commercial and recreational uses in a manner that will provide for the orderly development of Clover Island and areas adjacent to the Corps of Engineer's levee in a harmonious manner which accentuates and enhances Lake Wallula. 
(2)  Public Access Element. On Clover Island, improve public access to designated areas of Lake Wallula for recreational uses as indicated in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6). Maintain areas along Columbia Park, the levee and Duffy's Pond by which the public can reach Lake Wallula and Duffy's Pond for fishing, viewing and other public access purposes. Maintain access to the park and levee using pedestrian and bicycle bridges. 
(3)  Recreational Element. Enhance the recreational facilities potential of the shorelines. Clover Island recreational uses should complement existing and proposed developments. Maintain and enhance recreational facilities along Columbia Park and the levee to provide diversification in recreational uses. 
(4)  Circulation Element. Circulation to the levee and the Clover Island causeway should be improved for ease of access and should include adequate off-street parking facilities to serve the people who will be using area for recreational and commercial purposes. Maintain and enhance, where appropriate, circulation and access within Columbia Park. 
(5)  Shoreline Use Element. Assure that the various land uses are compatible and aimed toward maximum utilization without diminishing the quality of the environment. Shorelines abutting the levee area should take advantage of the presence of Lake Wallula and should be oriented in a manner to coordinate lakefront uses and non-lakefront uses. 
(6)  Conservation Element. Enhance the aesthetic characteristics and environmental functions and values of the levee, Duffy's Pond, Clover Island and Columbia Park areas and take necessary steps to conserve the natural setting of those shoreline areas which are presently in an undeveloped state. 
(7)  History, Scientific and Cultural Element. Establish areas on or near the levee and Columbia Park which will have a cultural, educational, historical or scientific value and protect these areas in a proactive and substantive way. 
(8)  Flood Prevention Element. Assure that, whenever feasible, steps are taken to prevent and/or minimize the risk of flood and associated flood damages to property and land uses. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.070: - Policies-Environment Designation of Shorelines. 
(1)  The City of Kennewick environment designation (ED) classification system consists of three shoreline environments. These environment designations have been established based on the findings in the Shoreline Inventory and Assessment Report of 2005. The delineation of each environment has been aimed to assure the protection of existing shoreline ecological functions. Such designations are consistent with policies for restoration of degraded shorelines, and aquatic and riparian habitat enhancement. The three shoreline environments are: 
(a)  Aquatic; 
(b)  Clover Island High Intensity; and 
(c)  Urban Conservancy. 
(2)  These shoreline environments are based on those provided in the State guidelines and include designation criteria and management policies that recognize the unique characteristics of Kennewick and specific areas of the shoreline. The areas within each environment are publically owned. 
(3)  The boundary of the designated shoreland areas shall be governed by the criteria set forth in RCW 90.58.030 and WAC 173-22-040 except that the City will amend the Shoreline Master Program to reflect the new designation within three years of the discovery of any discrepancy. 
(4)  All areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are not mapped and/or designated are automatically assigned an Urban Conservancy Environment Designation until the shoreline can be redesignated through the Shoreline Master Program amendment. 
(5)  The following policies apply to lands falling under the respective Environment Designation: 
(a)  "Aquatic" Environment. 
(i)  Purpose. The purpose of the "Aquatic" environment is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark. 
(ii)  Management Policies. 
(A)  New over-water structures are allowed only for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration. (WAC 173-26-211(5)(c)(ii)(A)). 
(B)  The size of new over-water structures shall be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure's intended use. 
(C)  In order to reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources, multiple uses of over-water facilities are encouraged. 
(D)  All developments and uses on navigable waters or their beds shall be located and designed to minimize interference with surface navigation, to consider impacts to public views, and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration. 
(E)  Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical freshwater habitats shall not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when their impacts are mitigated according to the sequence described in Appendix A-2, Critical Areas, and consistent with this Shoreline Master Program and RCW 90.58, the Shoreline Management Act, as necessary to assure no net loss of ecological functions. 
(F)  Shoreline uses shall be designed and managed to minimize degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions. 
(iii)  Designation Criteria. 
(A)  The "Aquatic" environment designation is assigned to lands within the City that are located waterward of the ordinary high water mark. 
(b)  "Clover Island High Intensity" Environment. 
(i)  Purpose. 
(A)  The purpose of the Clover Island "High Intensity" environment is to continue to provide economic development and recreation opportunities that add to the existing water dependent uses, and public access and view opportunities via a mix of high-intensity water-oriented and non-water-oriented commercial, multi-family residential, and transportation uses while providing additional public access, improved aesthetic quality, enhanced aquatic and nearshore ecological functions and maintaining view corridors consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6). 
(ii)  Management Policies. 
(A)  The Clover Island High Intensity Environment has been determined by the City to be a special area plan per WAC 173-26-211(5)(d)(ii)(A) and 173-26-201(3)(d)(ix). The Clover Island master plan goals, objectives and master plan elements are consistent with the goals, policies and objectives of the City's Shoreline Master Program. It is intended that the detail outlined in this Chapter (KMC 18.68) and development, enhancement and public access standards provided in Appendix A-6 will control development on Clover Island. 
(B)  The Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards and this Shoreline Master Program give priority to water-dependent uses. The City recognizes the many existing Clover Island water-dependent uses, including, but not limited to, existing marinas, boat launch, boat docks, and the fuel docking station. The Shoreline Master Program also gives priority to water-related and water-enjoyment uses, including existing and planned public viewing areas of the river and nearshore environment. Non-water-oriented uses are only allowed as part of the mixed use development, consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards. Non-water-oriented uses shall not conflict with existing and planned Clover Island water-oriented and water dependent uses, and must in all cases maintain and/or provide public access to the shoreline per the path/trail system and public viewing areas consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards, and accompanying development as it occurs. 
(C)  Multi-family and multi-lot residential and recreational developments shall provide public access and may provide the joint use community recreational facilities. 
(D)  Access, utilities, and public services shall be made available and sized adequately to serve existing needs and future development. 
(E)  Enhancement of shoreline ecological functions shall coincide with new development. Implementation of the aquatic and nearshore habitat enhancement standards, as required in this Chapter and the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards shall accompany new development and comply with relevant local, state, and federal law. Accompany, in this case, means within 12 months of completion of a new development project, the shoreline adjacent to the new development shall be enhanced consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards as identified in Appendix A-6-4. Enhancement work will be conducted within the work window specified in applicable federal and state permits (typically late fall/winter time period). 
(F)  Visual and physical public access to shorelines shall be maintained, dedicated, improved and enhanced consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (identified in Appendix A-6-1 through A-6-3), and WAC 173-26-221(4)(d) and KMC 18.68.110(2)(e). 
(iii)  Designation Criteria. 
(A)  The "Clover Island High Intensity" environment designation is assigned only to Clover Island, which currently supports high-intensity and water-dependent uses related to commerce, transportation and navigation. This environment designation is suitable and planned for additional high-intensity water dependent, water-oriented, and non-water-oriented uses, as part of mixed use development such as multi-family residential and commercial, while maintaining and enhancing public access, view corridors, and aquatic and nearshore habitat enhancement consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards. 
(c)  "Urban Conservancy" Environment. 
(i)  Purpose. The purpose of the "Urban Conservancy" Environment is to protect and restore ecological functions of open space, floodplain and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed settings, while allowing a variety of compatible uses. 
(ii)  Management Policies. 
(A)  Uses that preserve the natural character of the area or promote preservation of open space, floodplain or sensitive lands either directly or over the long-term should be the primary allowed uses. Uses that result in restoration or enhancement of ecological functions will be allowed if the use is otherwise compatible with the purpose of the environment and the setting. 
(B)  Assure no net loss of shoreline ecological processes or functions occurs as a result of new development. 
(C)  The location and design of new development shall provide for public access and public recreation opportunities whenever feasible and when significant ecological impacts can be mitigated. 
(D)  Water-oriented uses shall be given priority over non-water-oriented uses. For shoreline areas adjacent to commercially navigable waters, water-dependent uses shall be given highest priority. 
(iii)  Designation Criteria. 
(A)  An "Urban Conservancy" Environment designation is assigned to shoreline areas within the City that are appropriate and planned for development that is compatible with maintaining or restoring the ecological functions of the area, that are not generally suitable for water-dependent uses, or if any of the following characteristics apply: 
(I)  They are suitable for water-related or water-enjoyment uses; 
(II)  They are open space, floodplain or other sensitive areas that should not be more intensively developed; 
(III)  They have potential for ecological restoration; 
(IV)  They retain important ecological functions, even though partially developed; or 
(V)  They have the potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.

(A)  Development shall comply with Appendix A-2, Chapter 5, of this Chapter; 
(B)  New development or the creation of new lots that would cause foreseeable risk or adverse impacts from geological conditions to people or improvements during the life of the development shall be prohibited; 
(C)  New development that would require structural shoreline stabilization over the life of the development shall be prohibited. For Clover Island High Intensity Environment, structural shoreline stabilization, as necessary, shall be accompanied by habitat enhancement to improve riparian and nearshore habitat functions. Exceptions may also be made for the limited instances where stabilization is necessary to protect allowed uses where no alternative locations are available and no net loss of ecological functions will result as found in Section 18.68.120(3)(a). Proposed stabilization measures shall recognize the principles found in WAC 173-26-231(3)(a)(ii) and shall conform to standards found in WAC 173-26-231(3)(a)(iii)(A-F); and 
(D)  Where no alternatives, including relocation or reconstruction of existing structures, are found to be feasible, and less expensive than the proposed stabilization measure, stabilization structures or measures to protect existing residential structures may be allowed in strict conformance with the requirements of WAC 173-26-231 and then only if there is no net loss of ecological functions. 
(d)  Flood Hazard Reduction. 
(i)  Applicability. The provisions of this subsection apply to actions taken to reduce flood damage or hazard and to uses, development, and shoreline modifications that may increase flood hazards in shoreline jurisdiction. 
(ii)  Principles. The following are objectives of the provisions of this subsection: 
(A)  Where feasible, preference shall be given to non-structural flood hazard reduction measures over structural measures; 
(B)  In managing flood hazards within shoreline jurisdiction, the full spectrum of planning and regulatory measures shall be integrated; 
(C)  Flood hazard reduction measures shall, with appropriate mitigation sequencing, result in no net loss of ecological functions;

(E)  When evaluating alternate flood control measures, removal or relocation of structures in floodprone areas shall be considered; and 
(F)  Encourage planning for and facilitating removal of restrictions to off channel hydrological connections consistent with actions identified in the Shoreline Restoration Plan (Appendix A-4 to this Chapter). 
(iii)  Standards. The following standards shall apply to development in shoreline jurisdiction: 
(A)  Development in flood plains shall not significantly or cumulatively increase flood hazard nor be inconsistent with Shoreline Critical Areas Regulations in Appendix A-2 and the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance KMC 18.66 (Appendix A-7). New development or new uses in shoreline jurisdiction, including the subdivision of land, shall not be established when it would be reasonably foreseeable that the development or use would require structural flood hazard reduction measures; 
(B)  Where frequently flooded areas are identified as a Critical Area within shoreline jurisdiction, all proposed uses and development shall be subject to administrative provisions of this Chapter, and shall comply with development standards required by Shoreline Critical Areas Regulations in Appendix A-2, and the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance KMC 18.66 (Appendix A-7); 
(C)  New structural flood hazard reduction measures shall be allowed in shoreline jurisdiction only when it can be demonstrated by scientific and engineering analysis that they are necessary to protect existing development, that nonstructural measures are not feasible, that impacts to ecological functions can be successfully mitigated so as to assure no net loss, and that appropriate vegetation conservation actions will be undertaken consistent with WAC 173-26-221(5). Structural flood hazard reduction measures shall be consistent with KMC 18.66; 
(D)  New structural flood hazard reduction measures shall be placed landward of wetlands and vegetation conservation areas, and shall comply, as applicable, with Shoreline Critical Areas Regulations, Appendix A-2, Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance KMC 18.66, WAC 173-26-221(3)(c)(iii) and the provisions of this Chapter; 
(E)  New structural flood hazard reduction measures, such as dikes and levees, shall be designed to include and improve public access pathways unless public access improvements would cause unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public, inherent and unavoidable security problems, unacceptable and unmitigable significant ecological impacts, unavoidable conflict with the proposed use, or a cost that is disproportionate and unreasonable to the total long-term cost of the development; 
(F)  Removal of gravel for flood management purposes shall be consistent with Shoreline Critical Areas Regulations, Appendix A-2, KMC 18.66 and the provisions of this Chapter, and shall be allowed only after a biological and flood management study demonstrates the extraction has a long-term benefit to flood hazard reduction, does not result in a net loss of ecological functions, and is part of a comprehensive flood management solution. 
(e)  Public Access. 
(i)  Applicability. The provisions of this subsection apply to development in shoreline jurisdiction. 
(ii)  Principles. The following are the objectives of the provisions of this subsection: 
(A)  The public interest shall be promoted with regard to rights to access waters held in public trust by the State while protecting private property rights and public safety; 
(B)  The rights of navigation and space necessary for water-dependent uses shall be protected; 
(C)  To the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the State and the people generally, the public's opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of shorelines of the State, including views of the water, shall be protected; and 
(D)  Uses and the location, design, and construction of development in the shoreline jurisdiction shall, whenever feasible, minimize interference with the public's use of the water. 
(iii)  Standards. The following standards shall apply to development in the shoreline jurisdiction: 
(A)  All new development by public entities, including local government, port districts, state agencies, and public utility districts, shall include public access measures as part of each development project, unless such access is shown to be incompatible for safety, security, or impact to the shoreline environment reasons. 
For Clover Island, public access must be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (see Appendix A-6). Planned public access improvement specified by the pathways identified in Appendix A-6-2 exhibit (Public Access) shall be made within 12 months of build out of the following lots, as specified in the Appendix A-6-3 (Building Heights) exhibit: 
(I)  West and northwest (Causeway and "notch") and adjacent interior pathways will be completed proportionately within 12 months of Parcels A, B and C and Lot 1 completing build out; 
(II)  North shoreline pathway (from west edge of Lot 2, and Lots 3 through 11, 30, and 31) will be completed proportionately within 12 months of Lots 2 through 5 completing build out; and 
(III)  South shoreline and interior pathway (due south of "notch") will be completed within 12 months of eastern half of Lot 15 and Lots 16 through 18 completing build out. 
(IV)  Public access shall be provided along the south shoreline for eastern lot 13 through western half of Lot 15 as provided for in permitted Yacht Club development. 
(V)  Long-term shoreline pathway around east end of island (Lots 29 through 32) shall be phased in with any proposed improvements on those lots and/or shoreline stabilization occurring on Clover Island. 
(B)  New structural public flood hazard reduction measures, such as dikes and levees, shall dedicate and improve public access pathways unless public access improvements would cause unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public, inherent and unavoidable security problems, unacceptable and unmitigable significant ecological impacts, unavoidable conflict with the proposed use, or a cost that is disproportionate and unreasonable to the total long-term cost of the development; 
(C)  All new development for water enjoyment, and water-related and non-water-dependent uses and for subdivisions of land into more than four parcels or sections of leased lands, shall include dedicated and improved public access proposal measures and which shall be recorded with final site plan, unless such access is shown to be incompatible for reasons of safety, security, or impact to the shoreline environment, or where such measures are shown to be infeasible or alternative measures are shown to be more desirable. In determining the infeasibility, undesirability, or incompatibility of public access in a given situation, the applicant shall analyze and propose alternative methods of providing public access, such as off-site improvements, viewing platforms, separation of uses through site planning and design, and restricting hours of public access. The City Planning Official will then consider these alternative methods in a final permit decision. 
For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, developments and uses shall maintain and, where specified, enhance public access and view corridors consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6); 
(D)  All new development shall comply with the 35 feet height limitation, except for development provided in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, where the development shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards. Building or structures more than 35 feet above the ordinary high water mark in the Urban Conservancy and Aquatic Environments shall be processed through a Conditional Use Permit. 
For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, the City has determined that development will not obstruct views for a substantial number of residences on the adjoining state shoreline, as the existing levee currently blocks the entire shoreline view for existing residences. This is also true for the other residences south of the levee that extends along the entire shoreline of Segments D and E (Appendix A-1) For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, the view corridors and viewpoints established in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6-1) will be preserved, and development will remain within the established heights. 
The Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards will serve the public interest by providing economic development, enhancing public access, maintaining specified on-island view corridors, and providing for enhanced aquatic and riparian habitat. Therefore, areas specified in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards that exceed 35 feet in height on the island are allowed through the Substantial Development Permit process, consistent with other established standards for view, public access and habitat enhancement (see Appendix A-6). 
Specifically, according to WAC 173-27-160, the City has determined that, for the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, as specified in the City-adopted master plan and Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6), that the: 
(I)  Proposed uses are consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the Shoreline Master Program; 
(II)  Proposed uses will not interfere and will actually enhance the normal public use of public shorelines; 
(III)  Proposed uses and design of the project are compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the City's Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Master Program; 
(IV)  Proposed uses will cause no significant adverse effects and actually will enhance the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; 
(V)  Public interest will suffer no detrimental impacts and actually will benefit from the planned improvements; and 
(VI)  Cumulative impacts are addressed in Appendix A-5. 
(E)  As part of any master plan or proposal, other than those specified in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards, for structures over 35 feet in height, an applicant shall be required to submit a view analysis and cumulative impacts analysis that reviews residential obstruction(s) to allow the City to determine whether development under the master plan or proposal obstructs a substantial number of residences (RCW 90.58.320). Structures over 35 feet, other than those specified in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards, shall be approved only through a Conditional Use Permit process according to Section 18.68.240 of this Chapter and WAC 173-27-160. Designs shall protect visual access to the water from onshore. Shoreline view corridors shall be protected through incorporation of appropriate design (e.g., modulation of building heights and massing) and location of new development. Potential impacts to views shall be minimized through location and orientation of development on the subject property. The applicant shall: 
(I)  Incorporate a view analysis using photographs, videos, photo-based simulations, or computer-generated simulations. The view analysis shall assess and portray visual access from mainland residences adjoining the shoreline. In all cases, photographs, videos, land use, land cover, or other sources of information shall be no older than 12 months prior to submittal of the application. All photographic, video or simulated view representations will employ equipment that produces imagery with an angle of view equivalent to that achievable with a 35 mm "normal" camera lens, i.e., an angle of view of about 50. 
To document any possible obstruction of existing or potential residential views by proposed development in the Urban Conservancy Environment designation, a minimum of three pictures shall be taken from residences or potential residential lots at a radius of 400 feet from the proposed development at equal distances from each other and toward the shoreline; 
(II)  Ensure that the view analysis is cumulative in nature by including vacant existing parcels of record as well as existing structures. Vacant parcels of record shall be assumed to be developed and, as such, their structures to be in compliance with the 35-foot height limitation as established through photographs, videos, photo-based simulations, or computer-generated simulations; 
(III)  If demonstrated through photographs, videos, photo-based simulations, or computer-generated simulations that the proposed development will obstruct less than 30 percent of the view of the shoreline enjoyed by a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining such shorelines, then the development may be considered through the conditional use process; 
(IV)  In consideration of the potential view obstruction resulting from the proposed structure, side yard setbacks may need to be increased. No side yard setbacks shall be reduced to accommodate the proposed structure; and 
(V)  To address "overriding considerations of the public interest" the applicant shall provide a cumulative impacts analysis that documents the public benefits served by issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. The analysis shall address such considerations as cumulative view obstruction results of height adjustments (within a 1,000-foot radius) of the proposed development combined with those of other developments that exceed the 35-foot height limitation, environmental benefits (enhancement or restoration), public access/open space benefits, and economic benefits. The cumulative impact analysis shall address overall views that are lost, compromised, and/or retained; available view corridors; and surface water views lost, compromised, and/or retained. 
(F)  Public access improvements shall not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions; and 
(G)  Signage shall be in conformance with Section 18.68.130(3)(i) of this Chapter and the zoning code (KMC 18.24). All signs shall be located and designed to minimize interference with view corridors and visual access to the shoreline. 
(f)  Shoreline Vegetation Conservation, Restoration, and Enhancement. 
(i)  Applicability. Vegetation conservation includes activities to protect, restore or enhance vegetation along or near shorelines that contribute to ecological functions. The provisions of this subsection apply to all proposed development and uses in shoreline jurisdiction. 
(ii)  Principles. The following are the objectives of the provisions of this subsection: 
(A)  Scientific and technical information shall be used in addressing issues related to vegetation conservation; 
(B)  In protecting and restoring vegetation within shoreline jurisdiction, the full spectrum of planning and regulatory measures shall be integrated; and 
(C)  Existing ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes shall be protected, and restoration of degraded ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes shall be encouraged; 
(iii)  Standards. The following standards shall apply to development in shoreline jurisdiction: 
(A)  The design, construction and location of proposed new development and uses shall follow those goals, policies and guidelines set out in the Shoreline Critical Areas Ordinance (Appendix A-2);

(C)  At a minimum, the Applicant shall consult shoreline management assistance materials provided by Ecology and Management Recommendations for Washington's Priority Habitats, prepared by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, where applicable; 
(D)  Selective pruning of trees for safety and view protection may be allowed, establishing up to a 50-percent total view corridor. In the case where another view corridor has been specified in federal and/or state permits as beneficial for aquatic and terrestrial species, these provisions would apply. No topping shall be allowed unless approved by the Planning Official. The removal and control of noxious weeds is authorized. Removal of noxious weeds and/or invasive species shall be incorporated in vegetation management plans, as necessary, to facilitate establishment of a stable community of native plants; 
(E)  Vegetation removal not associated with a development permit application requires the submittal and approval of a mitigation and management plan prepared by a qualified biologist, and must be consistent with the provisions of this section; and 
(F)  Clover Island High Intensity - Vegetation planting for the aquatic and shoreline habitat enhancement plan, shall be consistent with the native vegetation and planting specifications provided in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6-4) and consistent with provisions in applicable federal and state permits. 
(g)  Water Quality, Stormwater, and Nonpoint Pollution. 
(i)  Applicability. The provisions of this subsection apply to all development and uses in shoreline jurisdiction that affect water quality. 
(ii)  Principles. The following are the objectives of the provisions of this subsection: 
(A)  Impacts to water quality and stormwater quantity that would result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions, a significant impact to aesthetic qualities, or recreational opportunities, shall be prevented wherever feasible; and 
(B)  Shoreline management provisions and other regulations that address water quality and stormwater quantity, including public health, stormwater, and water discharge standards, shall be integrated as feasible into permits issued under this Chapter. 
(iii)  Standards. 
(A)  All development activities approved under this Shoreline Master Program shall be designed and maintained consistent with the City's Stormwater Management Plan and Engineering Design Standards. Stormwater control and discharges shall be in compliance and maintained according to the Ecology Stormwater Manual for Eastern Washington. 
(B)  Shoreline use and development shall minimize the need for chemical fertilizers, pesticides or other similar chemical treatments to prevent contamination of surface and ground water and/or soils and adverse effects on shoreline ecological functions and values. 
(C)  All development in shoreline jurisdiction must meet all applicable local, state, and federal water quality protection standards and requirements and prevent impacts to water quality and storm water quantity that would result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions and prevent significant impacts to aesthetic qualities or recreational opportunities. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.120: - Shoreline Modifications. 
(1)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all shoreline modifications within shoreline jurisdiction. 
(2)  Principles. The following are the objectives of the provisions of this section: 
(a)  Shoreline modifications for the Clover Island High Intensity Environment shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6-4) and shoreline stabilization standards established in Section 18.68.120(3)(a); 
(b)  Structural shoreline modifications shall be allowed only where they are demonstrated to be necessary to support or protect an allowed structure, a legally existing shoreline use that is in danger of loss or substantial damage, or are necessary for reconfiguration of the shoreline for mitigation or enhancement purposes; 
(c)  Shoreline modifications shall be allowed only when appropriate to the specific type of shoreline and environmental conditions for which they are proposed; 
(d)  Shoreline modifications, individually and cumulatively, shall not result in a net loss of ecological functions; preference shall be given to shoreline modifications that have a lesser impact on ecological functions, and mitigation shall be required for identified adverse impacts resulting from shoreline modifications; 
(e)  Where applicable, scientific and technical information shall be used in planning for shoreline modifications; 
(f)  Restoration or enhancement of ecological functions shall be encouraged where feasible and appropriate, while accommodating permitted uses, and all feasible measures to protect ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes shall be incorporated. For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, enhancement shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6) and provisions in applicable federal and state permits; and 
(g)  Significant ecological impacts shall be mitigated as defined in this Chapter and according to the mitigation sequence in Appendix A-2. 
(3)  Standards for Specific Shoreline Modifications. 
(a)  Shoreline Stabilization. 
(i)  Shoreline stabilization measures include the following: 
(A)  Structural ("stabilization structures") and nonstructural methods to address erosion impacts to property and dwellings, businesses, or structures caused by natural processes, such as current, flood, tides, wind, or wave action; and 
(B)  Nonstructural methods including building setbacks, relocation of the structure to be protected, ground water management, planning and regulatory measures to avoid the need for structural stabilization. 
(ii)  New development, including newly created parcels, shall be designed and located to prevent the need for future shoreline stabilization, based upon hydrological or geotechnical analysis. 
(iii)  New development on steep slopes or bluffs shall be set back according to the requirements indicated in Appendix A-2 to ensure that shoreline stabilization is unlikely to be necessary during the life of the structure, as demonstrated by a geotechnical analysis. 
(iv)  New development that would require shoreline stabilization which causes significant impacts to adjacent or down-current properties and shoreline areas is prohibited. 
(v)  New structural stabilization measures shall not be allowed except when necessary as demonstrated in the following manner: 
(A)  To protect existing primary structures, new or enlarged stabilization structures for an existing primary structure, including residences, shall not be allowed unless there is conclusive evidence documented by a geotechnical analysis that the structure is in danger of failing within three years from shoreline erosion caused by currents, or waves. 
Normal sloughing, or shoreline erosion itself, without a geotechnical analysis, is not demonstration of need. In order to demonstrate need, the geotechnical analysis shall evaluate on-site drainage issues and address drainage problems away from the shoreline edge before considering structural measures. The erosion control structure with appropriate mitigation shall not result in a net loss of ecological functions; 
(B)  New stabilization structures in support of new non-water-dependent or water-dependent development shall be allowed when consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6) or when all of the following conditions apply: the erosion is not being caused by upland conditions such as the loss of vegetation and drainage; nonstructural measures such as placing the development further from the shoreline, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or sufficient; need is demonstrated by a geotechnical analysis that damage must be caused by natural processes such as currents, and waves; and the erosion control structure and appropriate mitigation will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions; 
(C)  New stabilization structures in support of projects for the restoration of ecological functions or hazardous substance remediation projects pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW shall be allowed when consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6) or when all of the following conditions apply: Nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements are not feasible or sufficient; and the erosion control structure and appropriate mitigation will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions; 
(D)  Shoreline stabilization shall be constructed to minimize damage to fish habitats and to maintain safe navigational movement. For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment shoreline stabilization below the OHWM to protect existing or planned upland water-dependent facilities specified in the plan or applicable federal and state permits shall be accompanied by habitat enhancement, including anchored brush piles or ballasted root wads or other specified measures. Open-piling construction is preferable in lieu of the solid type; 
(E)  Bulkheads shall be designed to permit the passage of surface or ground water without causing ponding or saturation of retained soil or materials. Adequate toe protection (proper footings, a fine retention mesh, etc.) shall be provided to ensure bulkhead stability without relying on additional riprap; and 
(F)  Bulkheads shall be designed to be of the minimum dimensions necessary. When a bulkhead is required at a public access site with planned water access, provision for safe access to the water shall be incorporated into its design. 
(vi)  Replacement of existing stabilization structures shall be based on demonstrated need to protect uses or structures from erosion caused by currents, or waves: 
(A)  The replacement structure shall be designed, located, sized and constructed to assure no net loss of ecological functions, and, if located in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, to also achieve improved aquatic and riparian habitat function. 
(B)  Waterward encroachment of a replacement structure shall be allowed for residences occupied prior to January 1, 1992; and then only if there are overriding safety or environmental concerns and then replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure and must still comply with applicable federal and state permit provisions. 
(C)  For Clover Island High Intensity Environment replacement structures must be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6-4) and applicable federal and state permit provisions, including anchored brush piles or ballasted root wads and native riparian vegetation plantings and other specified measures, or for soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration of ecological functions. 
(D)  Soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration or enhancement of shoreline ecological functions may be permitted waterward of the ordinary high water mark. Additionally, if the development is located in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, the soft shoreline stabilization measures shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards. 
(vii)  Geotechnical reports prepared pursuant to this section that address the need to prevent potential damage to a structure shall address the necessity for shoreline stabilization by estimating time frames and rates of erosion and shall report on the urgency associated with the specific situation. As a general matter, hard armoring solutions shall not be authorized except when a report confirms that there is a significant possibility that such a structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard armoring measures, or where waiting until the need is that immediate, would foreclose the opportunity to use measures that avoid impacts on ecological functions. Where the geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a structure, but the need is not as immediate as three years, that report may still be used to justify more immediate authorization to protect against erosion using soft measures. 
(viii)  Shoreline stabilization structures shall be limited to the minimum size necessary. Soft approaches shall be used unless demonstrated not to be sufficient to protect structures, dwellings, and businesses. Where feasible, ecological restoration or enhancement, and public access improvements shall be incorporated into the project. Public access shall be required as part of publicly financed shoreline erosion control measures except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. For the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, enhancements shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6) and applicable federal and state permit provisions, including anchored brush piles or ballasted root wads and native riparian vegetation plantings, and other specified measures, applicable federal and state permit provisions, including anchored brush piles or ballasted root wads and native riparian vegetation plantings and other specified measures. 
(ix)  For conditions of erosion or mass wasting due to upland conditions, projects must be consistent with standards set out in KMC 18.68.110(2)(b)(iii)(C). 
(x)  Riprapping and other bank stabilization measures shall be located, designed and constructed to avoid the need for channelization of streams and to protect, as feasible, the natural character of the streamway. 
(xi)  Where floodprotection measures such as levees are planned, they shall be placed landward of the streamway, including associated swamps and marshes and other wetlands directly inter-related and inter-dependent with the stream proper. 
(xii)  Where shoreline stabilization is allowed, it shall consist of "soft," flexible, and/or natural materials or other bioengineered approaches unless a geotechnical analysis demonstrates that such measures are infeasible. 
(xiii)  Publicly financed or subsidized shoreline erosion control measures shall not restrict appropriate public access to the shoreline, except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. Where feasible, ecological restoration and public access improvements shall be incorporated into the project. 
(b)  Piers, Viewing Platforms, and Docks. 
(i)  The following standards shall apply to new piers, viewing platforms and docks: 
(A)  New piers, viewing platforms, and docks are allowed in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6) to provide for existing and future water-dependent uses and subject to approval and conditions of federal and state permits addressing aquatic and riparian habitat, and consistent with the Shorelines Critical Areas Appendix A-2 requirements; 
(B)  New piers, viewing platforms and docks are allowed for public and commercial purposes. Docks serving four or less residential units are prohibited; 
(C)  New piers and docks are allowed only for water-dependent uses or public access; 
(D)  New piers and docks are restricted to the minimum size necessary to serve a proposed water-dependent use (based upon a needs analysis provided by the Applicant). For Clover Island High Intensity environment, the minimum width for piers, docks and ramps shall be six feet and the maximum width shall be 12 feet; 
(E)  New piers and docks are permitted only when specific need is demonstrated; and 
(F)  Water-related and water-enjoyment uses may be allowed as part of mixed-use development on over-water structures where they are clearly auxiliary to, and in support of, water-dependent uses, provided the minimum size requirement needed to meet the water-dependent use is not violated (WAC 173-26-231(3)(b)). 
(ii)  The use of floating docks shall be encouraged in those areas where scenic values are high and where conflicts with recreational boaters and fishermen will not be created. 
(iii)  Open-pile piers shall be encouraged where shore trolling is important, where there is significant littoral drift and where scenic values will not be impaired. Piers and viewing platforms for the Clover Island High Intensity Environment shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards and applicable federal and state construction standards and/or requirements. Pilings shall be permitted only when needed as a structural part of floating docks and to minimize the impact of local high winds on the structures. Pilings shall be structurally sound and cured prior to placement in the water. Creosote treated pilings are prohibited. Pilings employed in piers or any other structure shall have a minimum vertical clearance of two feet above the OHWM. The minimum number of pilings necessary shall be used in piers or viewing platforms. 
(iv)  Priority shall be given to the use of public piers, viewing platforms and docks. Cooperative use of these facilities is encouraged. 
(v)  New structures will be preferentially placed in developed areas to avoid degradation of habitat. 
(vi)  Location, design and construction of all piers, viewing platforms and docks shall result in no net loss of ecological processes and functions, and avoid, minimize and mitigate for ecological impacts. Construction materials and light transmission standards must be consistent with applicable state and federal requirements, and be based upon the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available. Piers, viewing platforms, and docks proposed in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment shall be consistent with the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards and applicable federal and state construction standards and/or requirements and other specified measures, including the following: 
(A)  New overwater structures must not be located on or within 50 feet of existing native aquatic vegetation; 
(B)  New overwater structures must be located in water sufficiently deep to prevent the structure from grounding out at the lowest low water; 
(C)  New pier, ramp or dock grating surfaces must provide for a 40-percent minimum open area; 
(D)  Flotation material must be encapsulated with a shell that prevents breakup or loss of flotation material, and cannot be located where it impedes fish passage; 
(E)  Replacement of existing covered boat facilities (boat garages, covered moorage) shall be composed of clear translucent materials that have a minimum 25 percent light transmittance in either the roof material or exposed wall; and 
(F)  Night lighting must be oriented to minimize illumination of surrounding waters. 
(vii)  Storage of fuel, oils and other toxic materials is prohibited on docks and piers except in portable containers that are provided with secondary containment. 
(c)  Fill. 
(i)  Location, design and construction of shoreline fills or cuts shall protect existing ecological values or natural resources and ensure that significant alteration of local currents will not occur nor create a hazard to adjacent life, property, and natural resources. Shoreline fills shall be avoided in critical areas or shoreline buffers, except for habitat enhancement as provided for in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards, and applicable federal and state permit provisions including native riparian vegetation plantings and other specified measures. When unavoidable, or buffers are not involved, they should be minimized, and designed and located so that there will be no significant damage to and no net loss of existing ecological functions; ecosystem-wide processes and natural resources shall be protected. 
(ii)  Fills waterward of the ordinary high water mark shall be allowed by Substantial Development Permit in the Clover Island High Intensity Environment for ecological enhancement as provided for in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards and applicable federal and state permit provisions, or by Conditional Use Permit when necessary to support the following uses:

18.68.130: - Shoreline Uses. 
(1)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to specific common uses and types of development to the extent they occur within shoreline jurisdiction. All uses and development must be consistent with the Shoreline Master Program. 
(2)  General Use Provisions. 
(a)  Principles. The following are objectives of the provisions of this section: 
(i)  Uses that are consistent with the control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon uses of the State's shoreline areas, are preferred. Preference shall be given first to water-dependent uses, second to water-related uses and third to water-enjoyment uses; 
(ii)  The location, design and construction of new development in shoreline areas shall be done in a way that protects the public's health, safety, and welfare, as well as the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and protects property rights while implementing the policies of the Shoreline Management Act; and 
(iii)  Permitted uses shall result in no net loss of ecological functions associated with the shorelines. 
(b)  Conditional Uses. 
(i)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to define the types of uses and development that require a shoreline Conditional Use Permit pursuant to RCW 90.58.100(5). Conditional Use Permits may be required for a variety of purposes, including: 
(A)  To effectively address unanticipated uses that are not classified in this Shoreline Master Program as described in WAC 173-27-030; 
(B)  To address cumulative impacts; and 
(C)  To provide the opportunity to require specially tailored environmental analysis or design criteria for types of use or development that may otherwise be inconsistent with a specific environment designation within this Shoreline Master Program or with the Shoreline Management Act policies. 
(ii)  Applicability. The following types of uses and development may require a Conditional Use Permit (see Section 18.68.240 for application process): 
(A)  Uses and development that may or will significantly impair or alter the public's use of the water areas of the State; 
(B)  Uses and development which, by their intrinsic nature, may have a significant ecological impact on shoreline ecological functions or shoreline resources depending on location, design, and site conditions; 
(C)  Specific shoreline uses identified in this Chapter as requiring a Conditional Use Permit; and 
(D)  The height limit for all uses shall be 35 feet in the Aquatic and Urban Conservancy Environments, and for the Clover Island High Intensity Environment, the heights provided in the Clover Island High Intensity Special Area Plan Standards (Appendix A-6). Proposed Uses may be able to exceed this limit through the Conditional Use process as described in Section 18.68.240. 
(c)  Prohibitions. 
(i)  Aquaculture activities are prohibited in shorelands. 
(ii)  Agriculture activities are prohibited in shorelands. 
(d)  Nonconforming Uses. When a shoreline use or structure which was lawfully constructed or established prior to the effective date of the Shoreline Management Act or the Shoreline Master Program, or amendments thereto, but does not conform to the present regulations or standards of the Shoreline Master Program or policies of the Act, the following standards shall apply: 
(i)  Nonconforming development may be continued and maintained, repaired, renovated, or structurally altered, provided that it is not enlarged, intensified, increased, or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity, except to enhance views from upland areas including streets, to enhance public access, or to contribute to protection, enhancement, restoration, or rehabilitation of or mitigation for impacts to critical areas or their buffers; 
(ii)  A nonconforming development which is moved any distance must be brought into conformance with the Shoreline Master Program and the Act; 
(iii)  If a nonconforming development is damaged to an extent not exceeding 75 percent of the replacement cost of the original development, it may be reconstructed to those configurations existing immediately prior to the time the development was damaged, provided that application is made for the permits necessary to restore the development within six months of the date the damage occurred, all permits are obtained and the restoration is completed within two years of permit issuance; 
(iv)  If a nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months or for 12 months during any two-year period, the nonconforming rights shall expire and any subsequent use shall be conforming. A use authorized pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall be considered a conforming use for purposes of this section; 
(v)  A structure which is being or has been used for a nonconforming use may be used for a different nonconforming use only upon the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. A Conditional Use Permit may be approved only upon a finding that: 
(A)  No reasonable alternative conforming use is practical; 
(B)  The proposed use will be at least as consistent with the policies and provisions of the Act and the Shoreline Master Program and as compatible with the uses in the area as the preexisting use; and 
(C)  In addition such conditions may be attached to the permit as are deemed necessary to assure compliance with the above findings, the requirements of the Shoreline Master Program and the Shoreline Management Act and to assure that the use will not become a nuisance or a hazard. 
(vi)  An undeveloped lot, tract, parcel, site, or division of land located landward of the ordinary high water mark which was established in accordance with City zoning requirements prior to the effective date of the Act and this Shoreline Master Program but which does not conform to the present lot size standards may be developed if permitted by other City land use regulations and so long as such development conforms to all other requirements of the applicable Shoreline Master Program and the Act; 
(vii)  Structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use but which are nonconforming with regard to setbacks, buffers or yards, area, bulk, height or density may be maintained and repaired and may be enlarged or expanded provided that said enlargement does not increase the extent of nonconformity by further encroaching upon, or extending into, areas where construction or use would not be allowed for new development or uses. 
Uses and developments that were legally established and are nonconforming with regard to the use regulations of the Shoreline Master Program may continue as legal nonconforming uses. Such uses shall not be enlarged or expanded. 
A use which is listed as a conditional use but which existed prior to adoption of the Shoreline Master Program or any relevant amendment and for which a Conditional Use Permit has not been obtained shall be considered a nonconforming use. A use which is listed as a conditional use but which existed prior to the applicability of the Shoreline Master Program to the site and for which a Conditional Use Permit has not been obtained shall be considered a nonconforming use. 
(e)  Shoreline Uses Table. 
(i)  The shoreline uses table identifies the level of approval required for the specific shoreline uses described in this Chapter. 
(ii)  Buffers shall be maintained in accordance with Critical Areas Appendix A-2, Chapter 6 or any other Chapters of this Appendix A-2 as appropriate within shoreline jurisdiction. 
(iii)  Building setbacks are measured landward from the edges of all critical area buffers or from the edges of all critical areas, if no buffers are required according to Appendix A-2, Section 1.220. 
(iv)  To provide flexibility in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with RCW 90.58.020, a Conditional Use Permit may be provided with special conditions, as applicable (see Sections 18.68.130(2)(b) and 18.68.240) 
(v)  Bulk, dimensional and performance standard exceptions are made through the variance process. 
(vi)  Reasonable Use. Where project proponents would seek a "Reasonable Use" exception to their proposal, they shall seek exception process and relief through the conditional use or variance process.

PART III: - ADMINISTRATION 

18.68.210: - Administrative Provisions. 
(1)  All proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act, and this Shoreline Master Program, regardless of whether a Substantial Development Permit, Conditional Use Permit or variance is required. 
(2)  The provisions of this section are minimum requirements and are not intended to limit the City's ability to permit other uses and developments within this Shoreline Master Program as shoreline conditional uses or shoreline variances where necessary or appropriate. 
(3)  The Planning Official shall administer this Chapter and may adopt such rules and make interpretations as deemed necessary to carry out its provisions. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.215: - SEPA Procedures.

(3)  As part of the SEPA review, the Planning Official may require additional information regarding the proposed development in accordance with WAC 197-11 and KMC Chapter 4.08. 
(4)  Failure of the applicant/proponent to submit sufficient information for the City to make a threshold determination shall be grounds for the responsible official to determine the application incomplete. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.220: - Shoreline Map. 
    The shorelines within the City and corresponding environment designations may be identified on an official shoreline map. Copies of the maps are available to the public at all reasonable times for inspection at the City of Kennewick Planning Department at 210 West 6th Avenue, Kennewick, WA 99336. These maps are available during the City Hall's normal business hours. Copies of portions thereof, or of the complete set, will be available from the Planning Department at the expense of the party requesting the same. The shoreline jurisdictional boundary shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for individual developments and permits. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.230: - Application for Substantial Development Permits. 
(1)  An applicant desiring to begin a new substantial development within the shoreline jurisdiction must apply to the Planning Official for a shoreline Substantial Development Permit. The application must comply with Section 18.68.260 of this Chapter. 
(a)  A Substantial Development Permit shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with: 
(i)  The policies and procedures of the Shoreline Management Act; 
(ii)  The provisions of this regulation; and 
(iii)  The adopted Shoreline Master Program for Kennewick's shoreline. 
(2)  Notice of Application. After filing a proper application, the City must publish notice thereof at least once a week on the same day of the week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The City must also mail written notice to the Clover Island Yacht Club, Port of Kennewick, Audubon Society, Park and Recreation Commission, and all property owners within 300 feet of the proposed substantial development. The City may require an applicant to give notice at his or her expense. 
Any interested person shall be allowed to submit comments regarding the application, or contact the Planning Official to request a copy of the action taken upon the application. All persons who submit their views and all others who notify the Planning Official within 30 days of the last date of publication of the notice are entitled to receive a copy of the action taken upon the application. 
(3)  Duties of the Hearing Examiner. The Planning Official shall make recommendations based on this Shoreline Master Program and transmit such recommendations to the Hearing Examiner within a reasonable time after the end of the 30-day notice period. The Hearing Examiner shall consider the proposed substantial development based on information from: the application; written comments from interested parties during the public comment period; independent study of the Planning Department; and views expressed during any public hearing which may be held by the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may request additional information. After the review, the 
Hearing Examiner shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny permits; provided that if the Hearing Examiner does not wish to follow the recommendations of the Planning Official, it may refer the matter back to the Planning Official for reconsideration. Upon receipt of the further recommendations of the Planning Official the Hearing Examiner shall then adopt the recommendation or consider the matter at its own public hearing. The Hearing Examiner may rescind any permit upon the finding that the applicant has not complied with the conditions of the permit. All permits entailing a variance or conditional use under the approved Shoreline Master Program shall be submitted to Ecology for its approval or disapproval. 
(4)  Notice of Action. The City must notify the following persons in writing of any final approval or denial of a permit: 
(a)  The applicant; 
(b)  Ecology; 
(c)  The Washington State Attorney General; 
(d)  Any person who has submitted written comments upon the application during the public comment period; and 
(e)  Any person who has written the Planning Department requesting notification. 
(5)  Building Permits Delayed. No building permit may be issued within 30 days of issuing a shoreline Substantial Development Permit or until all review proceedings initiated within those 30 days are terminated. Nothing in this permit shall be construed as excusing the applicant from compliance with any local, state, or federal statutes, ordinances or regulations applicable to the proposed substantial development. 
(6)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the granting, denying, or rescinding of a shoreline development permit may seek review by filing a request for review with the Shorelines Hearings Board, Ecology and the Attorney General within 30 days of receipt of the final order. 
(Ord. 5322 Sec. 64, 2010; Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.240: - Application for Conditional Use Permits. 
(1)  The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to provide a system within the Shoreline Master Program which allows flexibility in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020. In authorizing a conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the City to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the Act and the local Shoreline Master Program. 
(2)  Uses which are classified or set forth in this Shoreline Master Program as conditional uses and unlisted uses may be authorized, provided, that the applicant demonstrates all of the following: 
(a)  That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the Shoreline Master Program; 
(b)  That the proposed use shall not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines; 
(c)  That the proposed use of the site and design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Master Program; 
(d)  That the proposed use shall cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and 
(e)  That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect. 
(3)  In the granting of all Conditional Use Permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if Conditional Use Permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment. 
(4)  Other uses which are not classified or set forth in this Shoreline Master Program may be authorized as conditional uses, provided, the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional uses contained in the Shoreline Master Program. 
(5)  Uses which are specifically prohibited by the Shoreline Master Program may not be authorized pursuant to either subsection (2) or (3) of this section. 
(6)  Conditional Use Permits shall be processed as administrative permit applications with public notice and comment pursuant to KMC Chapter 18.42 and shall meet the approval criteria listed in this section. The Planning Official shall issue the permit and administrative appeals shall be heard by the Hearing Examiner. Non-administrative appeals are heard by the Shoreline Hearings Board. 
(7)  All notification shall be in accordance with WAC 173-27-110 and KMC Section 4.12.090. 
(Ord. 5322 Sec. 65, 2010; Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.250: - Application for Variance. 
    The purpose of a Variance Permit is strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this Shoreline Master Program where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the physical character or configuration of property such that the strict implementation of the Shoreline Master Program shall impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020. Variances may be authorized, provided, the applicant can demonstrate compliance with the following: 
(1)  Variance Permits shall be granted in circumstances where denial of the permit would result in a thwarting of the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary or unique circumstances exist and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect. 
(2)  Variance Permits for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), and/or landward of any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized, provided, the applicant can demonstrate all of the following: 
(a)  That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable Shoreline Master Program precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property; 
(b)  That the hardship described in (a) of this subsection is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the Shoreline Master Program, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant's own actions; 
(c)  That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and Shoreline Master Program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment; 
(d)  That the variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area; and 
(e)  That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief. 
(3)  Variance Permits for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), or within any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030 (2)(h), may be authorized, provided, the applicant can demonstrate all of the following: 
(a)  That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable Shoreline Master Program precludes all reasonable use of the property; 
(b)  That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsection (2)(b) through (e) of this section; and 
(c)  That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected. 
(4)  In the granting of all Variance Permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment. 
(5)  Variances from the use regulations of the Shoreline Master Program are prohibited. 
(6)  Variance Permits will be processed as administrative permit applications with public notice and comment pursuant to KMC Chapters 18.42 and 18.54, and shall meet the approval criteria listed in Section 18.68.250(2) above. The Planning Official will issue the permit and administrative appeals will be heard by the Hearing Examiner. 
(7)  All notification shall be in accordance with WAC 173-27-110 and KMC Chapter 4.12.090. 
(Ord. 5322 Sec. 66, 2010; Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.260: - Application Requirements for Substantial Development, Conditional Use, or Variance Permits.

(9)  A fee in accord with the adopted fee schedule; 
(10)  A site development plan consisting of maps and elevation drawings, drawn to an appropriate scale, to depict clearly all required information, photographs, and text which shall include: 
(a)  The boundary of the parcel(s) of land upon which the development is proposed; 
(b)  The ordinary high water mark of all water bodies located adjacent to or within the boundary of the project. This may be an approximate location, provided that for any development where a determination of consistency with the applicable regulations requires a precise location of the ordinary high water mark the mark shall be located precisely and the biological and hydrological basis for the location as indicated on the plans shall be included in the development plan. Where the ordinary high water mark is neither adjacent to or within the boundary of the project, the plan shall indicate the distance and direction to the nearest ordinary high water mark of a shoreline; 
(c)  Existing and proposed land contours. The contours shall be at intervals sufficient to accurately determine the existing character of the property and the extent of proposed change to the land that is necessary for the development. Areas within the boundary that will not be altered by the development may be indicated as such and contours approximated for that area; 
(d)  A delineation of all wetland areas that will be altered or used as a part of the development;

(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.270: - Cumulative Effects of Shoreline Development. 
(1)  The Planning Department shall, to the extent feasible, cooperate with adjacent jurisdictions to assess cumulative effects of shoreline development throughout the region. 
(2)  The Planning Official shall track development annually and every three years shall prepare a report that summarizes cumulative effects of authorized development on shoreline conditions, and also identifies restoration and/or enhancement projects that have been completed. The report shall be submitted for information to the Cities of Pasco and Richland, Benton County, the Port of Kennewick, Ecology, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Yakama Nation and Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.280: - Shoreline Exemptions. 
(1)  An exemption from a Substantial Development Permit process is not an exemption from compliance with the Act or this Shoreline Master Program, or from any other regulatory requirements. To be authorized, all uses and developments must be consistent with the policies and regulatory provisions of this Shoreline Master Program and the Act. An exemption from the requirement to obtain a substantial development permit is not an exemption from the requirement to obtain a conditional use permit or variance. The burden of proof that a development or use is exempt from the permit process is on the applicant. If any part of a proposed development is not eligible for exemption, then a substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project. The Planning Official may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Act and this Master Program. 
(2)  The following activities shall be considered exempt from the requirement to obtain a shoreline Substantial Development Permit: 
(a)  Environmental Excellence Program agreements (RCW 90.58.045): Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any legal requirement under this Chapter, including any standard, limitation, rule, or order is superseded and replaced in accordance with the terms and provisions of an environmental excellence program agreement, entered into under Chapter 43.21K RCW; 
(b)  Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council - RCW 90.58.140(9): The holder of a certification from the governor pursuant to Chapter 80.50 RCW; 
(c)  Hazardous Substance Remedial Actions - RCW 90.58.355: Any person conducting a remedial action at a facility pursuant to a consent decree, order, or agreed order issued pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW, or to Ecology when it conducts a remedial action under Chapter 70.105D RCW; 
(d)  Emergency Water Withdrawals and Facilities - RCW 90.58.370: All state and local agencies with authority to issue permits or other authorizations in connection with emergency water withdrawals and facilities authorized under RCW 43.83B.410 shall expedite the processing of such permits or authorizations in keeping with the emergency nature of such requests and shall provide a decision to the applicant within 15 calendar days of the date of application; 
(e)  Secure Community Transition Facilities - RCW 90.58.390: To meet an emergency caused by the need to expeditiously site facilities to house sexually violent predators who have been committed under Chapter 71.09 RCW, secure community transition facilities sited pursuant to the preemption provisions of RCW 71.09.342 and secure facilities sited pursuant to the preemption provisions of RCW 71.09.250; 
(f)  Fish Habitat Enhancement Projects - RCW 77.55.181(4): Fish habitat enhancement projects that meet the criteria of subsection (2)(a) of this section and that are reviewed and approved according to the provisions of this section when meeting the criteria further found in WAC 173-27-040(2)(p); 
(g)  Normal maintenance or repair of existing structures or developments, including damage by accident, fire or elements. Normal maintenance includes those usual acts to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from a lawfully established condition. Normal repair means to restore a development to a state comparable to its original condition within a reasonable period after decay or partial destruction, except where repair causes substantial adverse effects to the shoreline resource or environment. Replacement of a structure or development may be authorized as repair where such replacement is the common method of repair for the type of structure or development and the replacement structure or development is comparable to the original structure or development, including, but not limited to, its size, shape, configuration, location and external appearance and the replacement does not cause substantial adverse effects to shoreline resources or the environment; 
(h)  Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by the elements. An emergency is an unanticipated and imminent threat to public health, safety or the environment that requires immediate action within a time too short to allow full compliance with this Shoreline Master Program. Emergency construction does not include development of new permanent protective structures where none previously existed. Where new protective structures are deemed by the Planning Official to be the appropriate means to address the emergency situation, upon abatement of the emergency situation the new structure shall be removed or any permit that would have been required, absent an emergency, pursuant to RCW 90.58, WAC 173-27, or this Shoreline Master Program, shall be obtained. All emergency construction shall be consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58 and this Shoreline Master Program. As a general matter, flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur, but that are not imminent, are not an emergency; 
(i)  Construction or modification, by or under the authority of the Coast Guard or a designated port management authority, of navigational aids such as channel markers and anchor buoys; 
(j)  Operation, maintenance, or construction of canals, waterways, drains, reservoirs, or other facilities that now exist or are hereafter created or developed as a part of an irrigation system for the primary purpose of making use of system waters including return flow and artificially stored ground water for the irrigation of lands, provided that this exemption shall not apply to construction of new irrigation facilities proposed after December 17, 2003;

A dock is a landing and moorage facility for watercraft and does not include recreational decks, storage facilities or other appurtenances; 
(l)  The marking of property lines or corners on state-owned lands, when such marking does not significantly interfere with normal public use of the surface of the water; 
(m)  The process of removing or controlling aquatic noxious weeds, as defined in RCW 17.26.020, through the use of a herbicide or other treatment methods applicable to weed control that is recommended by a final environmental impact statement published by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Ecology jointly with other state agencies under RCW 43.21C; 
(n)  Site exploration and investigation activities that are a prerequisite to preparation of an application for development authorization under this Chapter, if: 
(i)  The activity does not interfere with the normal public use of the surface waters; 
(ii)  The activity will have no significant adverse impact on the environment including, but not limited to, fish, wildlife, fish or wildlife habitat, water quality, and aesthetic values; 
(iii)  The activity does not involve the installation of a structure, and upon completion of the activity the vegetation and land configuration of the site are restored to conditions existing before the activity; 
(iv)  A private entity seeking development authorization under this section first posts a performance bond or provides other evidence of financial responsibility to the local jurisdiction to ensure that the site is restored to preexisting conditions; and 
(v)  The activity is not subject to the permit requirements of RCW 90.58.550; 
(o)  Any development of which does not meet the definition of "Substantial Development" found in 18.68.040(40); 
(p)  Operation and maintenance of any system of dikes, ditches, drains, or other facilities existing on September 8, 1975, which were created, developed or utilized primarily as a part of an agricultural drainage or diking system; 
(q)  Any project with a certification from the governor pursuant to Chapter RCW 80.50; 
(r)  Watershed restoration projects as defined herein. Local government shall review the projects for consistency with the Shoreline Master Program in an expeditious manner and shall issue its decision along with any conditions within 45 days of receiving all materials necessary to review the request for exemption from the applicant. No fee may be charged for accepting and processing requests for exemption for watershed restoration projects as used in this section and must be meet the criteria further found in WAC 173-27-040(2)(o). 
(Ord. 5281 Sec. 1, 2009) 
18.68.290: - Legal Provisions. 
(1)  Violations and Penalties. 
(a)  In the event any person violates any of the provisions of this Chapter, the City may issue a correction notice to be delivered to the owner or operator, or to be conspicuously posted at the site. In a non-emergency situation, such notice may include notice of the intent to issue a stop work order no less than ten calendar days following the receipt of the correction notice. In an emergency situation where there is a significant threat to public safety or the environment, the City may issue a stop work order. The stop work order shall include, in writing, the right to request an administrative review within 72 hours following receipt of the stop work order. 
(b)  In addition to incurring civil liability under Section 18.68.290(2) below and RCW 90.58.210, pursuant to RCW 90.58.220 any person found to have willfully engaged in activities on shorelines of the State in violation of the provisions of the Act or of this Shoreline Master Program, or other regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall be punished by: 
(i)  A fine of not less than $25.00 or more than $1,000.00; 
(ii)  Imprisonment in the City jail for not more than 90 days; or 
(iii)  Both such fine and imprisonment; provided that, the fine for the third and all subsequent violations in any five-year period shall not be less than $500.00 nor more than $10,000.00 Provided further, that fines for violations of RCW 90.58.550, or any rule adopted thereunder, shall be determined under RCW 90.58.560. Each permit violation or each day of continued development without a required permit shall constitute a separate violation. 
(c)  The penalty provided in Subsection B shall be assessed and may be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same. The notice shall include the amount of the penalty imposed and shall describe the violation with reasonable particularity. In appropriate cases, corrective action shall be taken within a specific and reasonable time. 
(d)  Within 30 calendar days after the notice is received, the person incurring the penalty may apply in writing to the City for remission or mitigation of such penalty. Upon receipt of the application, the City may remit or mitigate the penalty upon whatever terms the City, in its discretion, deems proper. The City's final decision on mitigation or revisions may be reviewed by the Hearing Examiner if the aggrieved party files a written appeal therewith of said decision within ten calendar days of its issuance. 
(e)  If work activity has occurred on a site in violation of this Shoreline Master Program, prompt corrective action, restoration, or mitigation of the site will be required when appropriate. If this provision is not complied with, the City may restore or mitigate the site and charge the responsible person for the full cost of such an activity. Additionally, any and all permits or approvals issued by the City may be denied for that site for a period of up to six years. 
(f)  The City may suspend or revoke a permit if the applicant violates the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or exceeds the scope of the work set forth in the permit. 
(g)  Any person who willfully violates any court order or regulatory order of injunction issued pursuant to this Shoreline Master Program shall be subject to a fine of not more than $5,000.00, imprisonment in the County jail for not more than 90 days, or both. 
(2)  Remedies. 
(a)  The City Attorney or Planning Official, where authorized, shall bring such injunctive, declaratory, or other actions as are necessary to ensure that no uses are made of the shorelines of the State located within City of Kennewick in conflict with the provisions of this Shoreline Master Program, the Act, or other regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and to otherwise enforce the provisions of this Shoreline Master Program. 
(b)  Any person subject to the regulatory provisions of this Shoreline Master Program or the Act who violates any provision thereof, or permit, or permit condition issued pursuant thereto, shall be liable for all damage to public or private property arising from such violation, including the cost of restoring the affected area to its condition prior to violation. The City Attorney shall bring suit for damages under this section on their own behalf and on the behalf of all persons similarly situated. If liability has been established for the cost of restoring an area affected by a violation, the court shall make provision to assure that restoration will be accomplished within a reasonable time at the expense of the violator. In addition to such relief, including money damages, the court, in its discretion, may award attorney's fees and costs of the suit to the prevailing party. 
(c)  A person who fails to conform to the terms of a Substantial Development Permit, Conditional Use Permit or variance issued under RCW 90.58.140, who undertakes a development or use on shorelines of the State without first obtaining any required permit or authorization, or who fails to comply with a stop work order may be subject to a civil penalty.

CHAPTER 18.69 - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

18.69.010: - Purpose. 
    This Chapter regulates specific areas in addition to the basic C (Commercial) zoning district. These regulations may include aesthetics, land use, public improvements, and other related matters. These provisions are intended to promote organized development, preservation and use of contiguous, established areas. 
(Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.69.020: - Permitted Uses. 
    Only those uses permitted in the applicable underlying C (Commercial) zoning district are permitted in an overlay district. Uses may, however, be expanded, modified, or restricted by the provisions of the overlay district zone. If there is a conflict between the overlay district zone and the basic zoning district regulations, the overlay zoning regulations prevail. The establishment of an overlay zone repeals any special condition or limitation on a zoning classification within an overlay district. 
(Ord. 5180 Sec. 1, 2007) 
18.69.030: - Procedure to Establish. 
    Overlay zones are established in accord with Chapter 18.51 with the following exceptions:
