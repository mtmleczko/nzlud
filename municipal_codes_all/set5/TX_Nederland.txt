PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Nederland, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Billy B. Storey, City Manager, and Ms. LaDonna Floyd, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION, FORM OF GOVERNMENT, BOUNDARIES 

Section 1.01. - Incorporation. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Nederland, Texas, within the corporate limits as now established or as hereafter established in the manner provided herein, shall be and continue to be a municipal corporation and a body politic incorporated under the name of CITY OF NEDERLAND, TEXAS, possessed to all the property and interest of which it was possessed immediately prior to the time this Charter takes effect or may hereafter acquire with the powers, duties, obligations and liabilities now pertaining to said City, as a municipal corporation. 
Section 1.02. - Form of government. 
    The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government". Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to its limitations imposed by the State Constitution and by this Charter, all powers of the City shall be vested in an elective Council composed of four Councilmembers and a Mayor, hereafter referred to as the "Council" or "City Council", which shall enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies, have all the powers granted to cities by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted, and appoint the City Manager, who in turn shall be held responsible to the City Council for the execution of the laws and the administration of the government of the City. 
    All powers of the City shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter, or if the manner be not prescribed, then in such a manner as may be prescribed by ordinance, so long as there is no conflict with the general laws of the State of Texas. 
Section 1.03. - Boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the City of Nederland shall be those set out and described by metes and bounds in the Charter adopted by the City of Nederland on March 10, 1955, and the ordinances of annexation and of disannexation thereafter recorded in the Ordinance Books of the City of Nederland. The City Clerk shall maintain at all times a map indicating the current and correct boundaries of the City of Nederland. 
Section 1.04. - Extension of city boundaries. 
    The City Council shall have the power by ordinance to fix the boundaries of the City of Nederland. Without limiting the previous sentence, this power includes the ability to annex and to disannex territory, when permitted, to the extent, in the manner, and subject to any restrictions or limitations, provided by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas. 
Section 1.05. - Creation of ward boundaries. 
    The City of Nederland shall, by ordinance, divide the City into four (4) wards for the purpose of electing a bona fide resident from each ward as Councilmember. 
Section 1.06. - Change of ward boundaries. 
    The City Council shall have the power to alter or change the ward boundaries of the City of Nederland, and to subdivide the City anew into wards; designating the same by number, provided there shall at all times be four (4) wards within the City; and to adjust the now existing ward boundaries or future ward boundaries so that each ward shall contain as nearly as possible the same number of electors; and to make the above changes as often as the City Council may deem expedient. 
Section 1.07. - Exclusion and discontinuance of territory. 
    Whenever there exists within the corporate limits of the City of Nederland any territory not suitable or necessary for City purposes, the City Council may at its discretion, by ordinance discontinue said territory as part of said City; said ordinance shall specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be eliminated from the City and shall contain a plat designating such territory so that the same can be definitely ascertained; and when said ordinance has been duly passed the same shall be entered upon the minutes and records of said City, and from and after the entry of such ordinance said territory shall cease to be part of said City, but said territory shall still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area was a part of said City, and the City shall continue to levy, assess and collect taxes on the property within said territory to pay the indebtedness incurred while said area was a part of the City as though the same had not been excluded from the boundaries of the City. 
ARTICLE II. - POWERS OF THE CITY 

Section 2.01. - General. 
    The City of Nederland may use a corporate seal; may sue and be sued; may contract and be contracted with; may implead and be impleaded in all courts in all matters whatsoever; may cooperate with the government of the State of Texas or any agency thereof, the Federal Government or any agency thereof, or any political subdivision of the State of Texas; and shall have all the powers granted to cities by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas, together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted. The City may acquire property within or without its boundaries for any municipal purpose in fee simple or in any lesser interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, lease or condemnation and may sell, lease hold, manage and control any property now owned by it or which it may hereafter acquire; and may construct, own, lease, operate and regulate public utilities; may assess, levy and collect taxes for general and special purposes on all lawful subjects of taxation; may borrow money on the faith and credit of the City by the issuance and sales of bonds or notes of the City; may appropriate the money of the City for all lawful purposes; may regulate and control the use, for whatever purpose, of the streets and other public places; may make and enforce all police, health, sanitary and other regulations; and may pass such ordinances as may be expedient for the protection and maintenance of good government, peace and welfare of the City, for the performance of the functions thereof, for the order and security of its residents; and may provide suitable penalties for the violation of any ordinance enacted by the City of Nederland; and, except, as prohibited by the constitution and laws of this state or restricted by this Charter, the City may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every name and nature whatsoever. 
Section 2.02. - General powers adopted. 
    The enumeration of the particular powers in this Charter shall not be held or deemed to be exclusive but in addition to the powers enumerated herein or implied hereby or appropriate to the exercise of such powers, the City shall have and may exercise all power of local self-government and all other powers which, under the constitution and laws of the State of Texas, it would be competent for this Charter specifically to enumerate. The City of Nederland shall have and may exercise all the powers enumerated in Article 1175, Chapter 13, Title 28, of the Revised Civil Statutes of the State of Texas of 1925 as now or hereafter amended. 
    It is the expressed intention that this Charter shall confer upon the City of Nederland and the Council all of the powers of local self government conferred upon Home Rule Cities by the Constitution of Texas and the statutes of this state. 
Section 2.03. - Eminent domain. 
    The City shall have the full power and right to exercise the power of eminent domain when necessary or desirable to carry out any of the powers conferred upon it by this Charter or by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas. The City may exercise the power of eminent domain in any manner authorized or permitted by the constitution and laws of this state. The power of eminent domain hereby conferred shall include the right of the City to take the fee in land so condemned and such power and authority shall include the right to condemn public property for such purposes.

Section 11.04. - Official ballot. 
    The City Clerk shall make up the official ballot from the names presented to him. The order in which the names of the candidates for each place shall appear on the ballot shall be determined by lot, in a drawing held under the supervision of the City Clerk.

    Any member or all members of the Council (including the Mayor) may be recalled and removed from office by the electors qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent by the following procedure: 
    A petition signed by qualified voters entitled to vote for a successor to such member sought to be removed equal in number to 25% of the entire number of persons entitled to vote in said city as appears from the poll tax rolls of Jefferson County for the year ending the 31st day of January next preceding, demanding the recall of the Mayor or any councilmember, shall be filed with the City Clerk. Such petition shall contain a general statement of the ground for which the removal is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the street and number. One of the signers to each paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that each signature is that of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten days from the filing of such petition the City Clerk shall examine the same and from the list of qualified voters, ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified voters, and if requested to do so, the Council shall allow him extra help for that purpose. He shall attach to said petition a certificate showing the results of such examination. If by the City Clerk's certificate the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten days from the date of such certificate by obtaining additional signatures. The City Clerk shall within ten days after such amendment is filed, in case one is filed with him, make like examination of the said amended petition and if his certificate shall show same to be insufficient, shall be returned to the person filing same and shall not be subject to amendment. 
    If the petition be found sufficient, the City Clerk shall submit the same to the Council without delay and the Council, in the event the Mayor or Councilman named in said petition fails to resign, shall order and fix a date for holding the said election not less than forty nor more than fifty days from the date of the City Clerk's certificate; provided that if an election is to be held within the City for any other purpose within sixty days from the date of said certificate, then the said recall election shall be held on the same day. If the Mayor or Councilman in question resigns, no election shall be necessary and the vacancy shall be filled by the Council as in other cases of vacancies unless the number of vacancies created by resignation shall require an election as in this Charter otherwise provided. 
    If a recall election shall be required, the Council shall make or cause to be made publication of notice and provide the holding of such election and the same shall be conducted, returned and the results thereof declared in all respects as other city elections. Any officer so elected shall hold office only during the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any person sought to be removed may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requests otherwise in writing, the City Clerk shall place his name on the official ballot without nomination. The names of other candidates for such position shall be placed on the official ballot by petition in the same manner as provided for in other portions of this Charter. At such election if such person other than the incumbent is elected, the incumbent shall thereupon be deemed removed from the office upon the qualifications of his successor. If the incumbent is elected at such election, he shall continue in office and shall not be subject to any other recall for any grounds existing prior to said election.

Section 17.14. - Submission of Charter to electors. 
    The Charter Commission in preparing this Charter finds and decides that it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function it is necessary that it should be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons the Charter Commission directs that the said Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Nederland at an election to be held for that purpose on the 10th day of March, A.D., 1955. If a majority of the qualified voters voting in such election shall vote in favor of the adoption of this Charter, it shall become the Charter of the City of Nederland and after the returns have been canvassed, the same shall be declared adopted. 
    An official copy of the Charter shall be filed with the records of the City and the Mayor shall as soon as practicable certify to the Secretary of State an authenticated copy under the seal of the City, showing the approval by the qualified voters of such Charter. 
    In not less than thirty (30) days prior to such election the City Council shall cause the City Clerk to mail a copy of this Charter to each qualified voter of the City of Nederland as appears from the tax collector's roll for the year ending January 31 preceding said election.

(Ord. No. 2015-13, § 1(Exh. A), 9-14-15) 
Sec. 10-26. - Dangerous/vicious dog. 
    The ACO/LRCA may euthanize or authorize the euthanasia of any dangerous/vicious dog found running at large within the city that has previously bitten or the potential to cause bodily injury to a person or other animals. 
    For purposes of this section, the term "dangerous/vicious dog" means a dog that: 
(1)  Has attacked and/or shows the potential to inflict serious injury or death to a person or bites a person other than the owner without provocation on public or private property; 
(2)  Has killed or severely injured a domestic animal without provocation while off the owner's property; 
(3)  Has a known or apparent propensity, tendency or disposition to attack unprovoked, to cause injury, or to otherwise threaten the safety of persons or domestic animals; or 
(4)  Is trained or harbored for fighting which may be determined based on whether the dog exhibits behavior and/or bears physical scars or injuries which indicate that the animal has been trained or used for the purpose of fighting. 
    If a dog acts as stated in this section or is trained or harbored for fighting, the ACO/LRCA shall impound the dog immediately if it is at large; or if it is in the possession of anyone other than the owner, the ACO/LRCA shall immediately take possession of the dog and impound it in order to preserve the safety of the public. 
    In the event the owner is in possession of the animal, the ACO/LRCA shall notify the owner and take immediate possession of the animal for quarantine purposes if in fact, a person has been bitten. A dog that is impounded under this statute shall not be released until a final determination is made by filing a dangerous dog declaration (chapter 822.022 THSC) of the disposition of the animal. 
(Ord. No. 2015-13, § 1(Exh. A), 9-14-15) 
Sec. 10-26.A. - Declaration of dangerous/vicious dog. 
    The ACO/LRCA may declare a dog to be a dangerous/vicious dog if the official has sufficient cause to believe that the animal is dangerous/vicious. The ACO/LRCA, within five calendar days of taking possession of the dog, shall file with the court a declaration to deem the dog dangerous/vicious. Written notice shall be given to the owner of the hearing location, date, time that the ACO/LRCA has set to deem the dog dangerous/vicious. The dangerous dog declaration order by the court shall set the requirements for the owner to take possession of the dangerous/vicious dog if the court allows the dog to be returned to the owner. 
    In the event the owner is not present at the dangerous/vicious dog hearing, all rights shall be forfeited and the ACO/LRCA shall take appropriate action as ordered by the court to have the dog euthanized. The owner shall be notified by registered or certified mail as to the outcome of the dangerous/vicious dog hearing. 
    The owner of a dog declared to be a dangerous/vicious dog may appeal the determination of the court. Appeal of the court's determination is accomplished by filing a written request for a determination hearing with the city municipal court no later than five calendar days from receipt of the written notice. Failure to appeal the declaration by filing a written request for a determination hearing with the city municipal court within five calendar days from the owner's receipt of the written notice described in this section shall result in the court's declaration as being final. 
    If the owner of a dangerous dog cannot be determined after reasonable efforts to do so and after holding the dog for 72 hours, unless injured, ill, or it is an officer safety issue, the animal may be disposed of in a humane manner. If the owner of a dangerous dog that has been impounded is known, but cannot be located for service of the notice required herein either in person or by mail, the animal may be disposed of in a humane manner after a reasonable effort has been made to locate such owner. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the city to hold the dangerous dog longer than 72 hours because it is unclaimed.

    The dangerous dog, when taken outside the enclosure, must be securely muzzled in a manner that will not cause injury to the animal nor interfere with its vision or respiration, but shall prevent it from biting any person or animal. A dangerous dog may not be chained to any object outside of a secure enclosure either on or off the property of the owner. 
    If the owner of a dangerous dog is unable or unwilling to comply with the ownership requirements listed above at any time, the animal must be surrendered to the ACO/LRCA for euthanasia in a humane manner by the city ACO/LRCA or a licensed veterinarian or removed from the city as directed by the municipal court judge. In the event, the animal is sold, given away or removed from the city, the owner shall notify the ACO/LRCA of the destination of the dog's removal and all the aforementioned requirements shall apply and the dangerous dog declaration shall follow the animal wherever it goes.

Sec. 18-220. - Required; to whom issued; exemption. 
(a)  Permits shall be issued to master electricians or master sign electricians qualified to secure permits, as set forth in this article, or to their duly authorized agent. The master electrician or master sign electrician shall certify their duly authorized agent to the building official in the form of an affidavit stating that such master or master sign electrician assumes all and full responsibility for any permit taken out or applied for by such agent. Upon permitting, the licensed master electrician and licensed electrical contractor shall submit the names of all licensed journeyman and apprentice electricians that will be performing the work at the permitted job site. 
(b)  In the actual work of installing, maintaining, altering, or repairing of any electrical conductors or equipment for which a permit is required by this article, there shall be present and in direct supervision a qualified electrician of the proper classification as determined by this article. It shall be required that a master electrician or master sign electrician, as the case may be, be liable and responsible for the layout and technical supervision of any work which has required the securing of permits and journeyman electrician shall not supervise at the job site more than three apprentices. Should it come to the notice of the chief building official or his assistants that such supervision and control are not being maintained, the chief building official may order the work to be discontinued and the person to whom the permit has been issued shall discontinue further work until proper supervision has been employed or supplied as verified by the chief building official. 
(c)  When one master electrician or master sign electrician completes the rough work, in whole or in part, or does any electrical wiring or installation of fixtures or equipment and a second master electrician or master sign electrician is called upon to complete the work, in whole or in part, a separate permit is required for which regular fees shall be paid for the work done. Each master or master sign electrician shall be held responsible only for the work installed by him. Before the second master electrician or master sign electrician is issued a permit for the completion of an electrical wiring or installation of fixtures or equipment job, the chief building official shall first attempt to notify the master electrician or master sign electrician holding the original or first permit that the second permit is to be issued. The issuance of the second permit shall cancel the first permit and no refund of fees shall be made. 
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent a person from doing electrical work himself on his own residence, which is owned and occupied, or to be occupied by him immediately upon completion of such residence, so long as he complies with all of the other provisions of this article. This exception shall be construed to mean an individual owner (not a firm, co-partnership, or corporation) who actually does the labor himself. This individual owner shall be present at the time of any electrical inspection. Electrical work on rent property shall be performed by a licensed and bonded master electrician or a journeyman electrician working directly under the direction of a master electrician.

ARTICLE VI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1999-08, §§ 1-24, adopted Aug. 23, 1999, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, its inclusion as §§ 22-201-22-224 was at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 22-201. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings, meetings and in reports made available to the council, and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Beaumont, Texas; Jefferson County, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle. Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Cleveland, Ohio, the Council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses may lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that presently are sometimes uncontrolled by the managers of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for certain activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, may easily occur at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which may create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Many communicable diseases may be spread by activities which may occur in sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(7)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (6) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(8)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(9)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of and those conducting any business in the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its customers and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. 
(10)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity which may occur in such booths. 
(11)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(12)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, may aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(13)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees and other persons who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(14)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of time serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(15)  Barring alcohol from adult clubs is supported by evidence of experiences of other urban areas and local police reports of criminal activity around adult clubs which serve alcohol and will advance the important governmental interests of preventing crime and neighborhood deterioration. 
(16)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article. 
(17)  These regulations are promulgated pursuant to and in conformity with chapter 243 of the Local Government Code of Texas, as amended and, pursuant to the city's authority as a local government to regulate businesses and activities that may be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. 
(18)  These regulations do not legalize anything prohibited under the Texas Penal Code or any other law or regulation.

(m)  EMS providers shall respond, at minimum, an ALS ambulance priority two to all known structure fires or incidents that could be hazardous to life or health. Central dispatch shall notify the EMS provider on rotation the location, type, and any known response hazards that may exist at the scene of the stand-by. 
(n)  Ambulances that respond to a scene designated as a stand-by, should stage in an area that would enable the EMS personnel to render speedy medical attention and transport if needed. These ambulances shall not stage in any area that would prevent transporting immediately from the scene or interfere with emergency operations. 
(o)  If the EMS provider is unable to respond to a stand-by, the incident commander shall be notified via central dispatch. The EMS provider shall make every effort to supply an ambulance in an expedient manner.

Sec. 38-34. - Vehicle inspections. 
(a)  Every EMS vehicle, which operates in the City of Nederland response area, shall be made available to the fire chief or his designee for inspection upon request. The EMS provider will be notified of the unit or units to be inspected. There shall be only one ambulance at the fire station being inspected at a time. This unit will be brought to the Nederland Fire/Rescue Department for inspection before 1700 the day of request. However, if the request is made after 1300 hours the EMS provider may request to have the inspection the following business day. 
(b)  Every ambulance operated by a permitted EMS provider may also be spot inspected at any time. The EMS vehicle will not be kept out of service for any length of time and shall be returned to service immediately if the ambulance is needed. However, if the ambulance is unsafe or found to be out of compliance with this article or any federal or state laws, the ambulance permit will be suspended immediately. (See section 38-34)(f).)

The ambulance will not be allowed to return to service until it has been inspected and meets all State and local rules and regulations. 
(d)  When inspecting an EMS vehicle, it will be taken into consideration that the ambulance has been in service and reasonable usage of supplies will have occurred. No ambulance shall respond to calls of any nature, emergency or transport, within the service area if the supplies are below the EMS provider's protocols minimum. 
(e)  An ambulance permit may be suspended at any time an ambulance fails an inspection. This will not be used as a reason for poor response times. It is the EMS provider's responsibility to maintain the ambulances, equipment, and supplies as set forth by the State of Texas, this article, and the EMS provider's protocols. 
(f)  Any EMS vehicle that has had its ambulance permit suspended will not be allowed to operate in the City of Nederland response area until the ambulance has passed re-inspection.

(g)  A record of all revoked or suspended ambulance and or provider's permits, and any incident reports will be kept in the EMS provider's file. This information will be used when considering the renewal of an EMS providers permit and for assessing penalties or fines. 
(Ord. No. 2004-05, § 1, 7-12-04)

(1)  For failure to respond within 7:59 following dispatch for two consecutive months on a minimum of 95 percent of Priority One calls, the EMS provider shall be assessed a fine of $2,000.00 for each percentage point below the 95 percent level.

(b)  Before assessing liquidated damages against any EMS provider written notice will be given. 
(c)  The EMS provider will have ten calendar days from the receipt of notice to appeal the assessment to the Nederland Fire Chief.

(3)  Fails to maintain vehicles and equipment in such a way as to insure the ability of the EMS provider to respond, treat, and transport crews or patients to and/or from medical scenes in a safe expedient manner.

If the fire chief finds the permit should be terminated, it will be referred to the Nederland City Council for review and determination. The determination of the Nederland City Council findings will be final. 
(e)  If the Nederland City Council finds an EMS provider in material breach and revokes its permit, such revocation shall be effective immediately.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 50-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Nederland, Texas does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. I, § A, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-2. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Nederland are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. I, § B, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. I, § C, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the 1-percent-annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).

    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year - also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS). See "flood elevation study." 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. V, § A, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-51. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) article III, section 50-31, (ii) article IV, section 50-41(8), or (iii) article V, section 50-52(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to at least one and one-half feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in article IV, section 50-42(1)(a), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least one and one-half feet above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.

c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of article IV, section 50-42(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. V, § B, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-52. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with article I, sections 50-2, 50-3, and 50-4 of this chapter. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of article III, section 50-32; article IV, section 50-42; and the provisions of article V of this chapter. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to article III, section 50-31 or article IV, section 50-41(8) of this chapter. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. V, § C, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-53. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article III, section 50-31, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in article IV, section 50-42 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2012-17, art. V, § D, 12-10-12) 
Sec. 50-54. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in article III, section 50-31, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If article V, section 50-54(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

The notice shall give the applicant or holder of the permit the reasons for denial, suspension or revocation. A delivery of the notice may be accomplished by personally delivering it to the applicant or permit holder, by mailing a copy of the notice to the applicant or holder at the address indicated on the permit application, or by leaving a copy of the notice with a responsible person working at the establishment. 
(b)  The applicant or holder of the permit may request a hearing before the city council on the permit denial, suspension or revocation by filing a request for hearing with the city, in writing, within ten days following the receipt of the notice, such period to begin on the day following the receipt of the notice of denial, suspension or revocation. If no request for hearing is received by the city within the allotted time, the denial, suspension or revocation is sustained. 
(c)  If a timely request for hearing is received by the city, a hearing will be conducted during which the applicant or holder may present evidence to show why the permit should not be denied, suspended or revoked. Based upon the evidence of such hearing, the city shall make a final decision and shall uphold, suspend, modify or rescind any notice or order considered in the hearing. A written report on the hearing decision shall be furnished to the applicant or the holder of the permit by the city. 
(d)  If a permit is suspended, the suspension will be lifted only when the permit holder abates all the defects which originally gave rise to the suspension. Failure to correct the defects within the time period given by the city or to request a hearing, in writing, to the city within ten days of the receipt of the suspension notice shall be sufficient cause for the suspension to become a final revocation of the permit. 
(e)  Whenever a denial or revocation of a permit has become final, the applicant or holder of the revoked permit may make written application for a new permit. The applicant or holder of the revoked permit must meet all rules and requirements as stated in this section before a new permit will be issued.

Sec. 70-83. - Triggering criteria for initiation and termination of drought response stages. 
    The mayor and city council, the city manager, and/or the director of public works, or their designee, shall monitor water supply and/or demand conditions on a daily basis and shall determine when conditions warrant initiation or termination of each stage of the plan. Public notification of the initiation or termination of drought response stages shall be by means of publication in a newspaper or general circulation, use of the broadcast media, internet services, direct mail to each customer, signs posted in public places, and/or available notification technology. The triggering criteria described below will be initiated as follows: 
  By public works director, or designated personnel (*) 
  By city manager and/or the mayor and city council (**) 
  By mayor and city council (***) 
The city has an existing water conservation plan dated October 1996 and subsequently updated. The information in that plan is to be the same as presented herein and there are no conflicts intended. The city's raw water supplier, the Lower Neches Valley Authority (LNVA) has established trigger conditions based on the water surface elevation in Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The trigger conditions vary seasonally and are described, along with the actions taken and goals of the response measures for each water shortage stage. 
(a)  Stage I-Moderate water shortage condition. 
Requirements for initiation: The city will recognize that a moderate water shortage condition is in progress and customers shall adhere to the prescribed restrictions on certain water uses, defined in section 70-82, definitions, when the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The LNVA provides official notice to the city that Sam Rayburn Reservoir has remained below the following season critical lake level shown below: 
Lake Level Time Period 158.0 MSL January 1-March 31 160.0 MSL April 1-July 31 158.0 MSL August 1-August 31 156.0 MSL September 1-December 31  
(2)  Water demand is approaching the safe capacity of the system on a sustained basis. Sustained water usage over 4.0 mgd for five consecutive days is the stage I trigger condition. (*) 
(3)  If a mild contamination is noted in the raw surface water, but the water can still be treated by the existing facilities by means such as increasing chlorine dosage; or additional sources of pollution, serious enough to threaten the quality of water at the city's intake, are reported within the Neches River basin upstream from the LNVA intakes. (*) 
(4)  Water levels in tanks are consistently below 3/4 full (five days uninterrupted). (**) 
(5)  Local power failures are imminent as a result of power station failures, storms, transmission problems, or excessive power demand in the area. (**) 
(6)  Performance of surface water pumps, booster pumps, or other equipment (including pumping equipment for the LNVA Canal) indicates imminent failure. (**) 
(7)  The transmission line from canal to water plant is in imminent danger of failure. (**) 
(8)  Levees are approaching failure conditions in portions of the LNVA Canal system which are vital to providing Nederland with raw water. (**) 
(9)  Water supply emergencies in outlying communities interconnected to the city could require diversion of local water supplies. (***) 
(10)  Severe freezing conditions are forecast, and widespread breakage of home plumbing, water treatment units, and/or breakage of distribution lines is anticipated. (***) 
(11)  The Mid County area is under a severe storm warning and falls in the path of the storm. (***) 
Goal: Achieve a voluntary 30 percent reduction of non-essential water use and prevent wasting of water. 
Measures: 
  When the system reaches moderate water shortage conditions, the city will advise its customers and may request customers to curtail their consumption of water for nonessential uses. 
  The city will request its residential customers implement voluntary conservation measures, including restriction of lawn irrigation. Customers may be requested to prohibit other non-essential outdoors uses, such as car washing, filling of swimming pools, etc. The city will use the news media to inform the public of the need to limit non-essential water use. 
  The city will request its commercial and industrial customers evaluate water conservation practices in order to minimize process water use to the extent feasible and to encourage basic water conservation practices among employees. 
  City personnel will monitor water delivery facilities to prevent wasting of water. 
Requirements for termination: The city will recognize that the stage I condition has ended when the Sam Rayburn Reservoir is above the critical water levels defined above for 30 consecutive days. In addition, the city manager, the director of public works, and/or the mayor and city council must use judgment as to whether to upgrade, continue, downgrade, or discontinue an emergency. The decision to terminate or downgrade an emergency will normally be made at the level mayor and city council, city manager, or public works director at which the emergency was declared, such as water demand has been reduced to safe levels and is expected to remain stable, actual contamination of water supplies is ended or is under control; or threat of contamination has subsided; or alternate supply has been obtained on temporary or permanent basis, water levels in elevated or ground storage tanks have been restored to normal, etc. The city will notify its customers via the media of the termination of stage I in the same manner as the notification of initiation of stage I. 
(b)  Stage II-Severe water shortage condition. 
Requirements for initiation: The city will recognize that a severe water shortage condition is in progress and customers shall adhere to the prescribed restrictions on certain water uses, defined in section 70-83, definitions, when the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The LNVA provides official notice to the city that Sam Rayburn Reservoir has remained below 153.0 MSL for a continuous period of 20 days. With Sam Rayburn water surface at elevation 153.0 MSL the remaining water in the conservation pool is sufficient to sustain LNVA's water use demands for approximately one year without significant rainfall in the basin. 
(2)  Water demand occasionally reaches firm capacity (6.0 mgd) of the system (two days within a 30-day period), and failure of any pump, chlorine feeder, or surface treatment unit could reduce the level of service to the system. (*) 
(3)  Surface water contamination is approaching limit of treatability with existing facilities. (*) 
(4)  Over 20 percent of storage tank capacity is out of service due to structural failure, leakage, maintenance, or contamination. (*) 
(5)  Water level in tanks is consistently below half full (three days uninterrupted). (**) 
(6)  A surface water treatment unit has been damaged from a severe storm. (**) 
(7)  Water emergencies in adjacent communities require diversion of so much water that the level of service to any part of the Nederland system is threatened. (**)

(9)  All or most surface water pumps in any group (canal or city pumps) have failed due to mechanical problems and will be out of service for an extended period of time. (***) 
(10)  Water emergencies in adjacent communities require so much water diversion that service to portions of the Nederland system is severely disrupted. (***) 
Goal: Eliminate all non-essential water use to the maximum extent possible and achieve a 20 percent reduction in total water use. 
Measures: 
  When the system reaches moderate water shortage conditions, the city will advise its customers and may request customers to curtail their consumption of water for nonessential uses.

(a)  The city council finds and determines that the location of signs within and adjacent to public streets, roads and alleys and at the intersections thereof constitutes an obstruction to the vision of drivers of motor vehicles and a menace to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic upon the public streets, requiring the adoption of reasonable regulations in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare.

ARTICLE IV. - PRIVATE SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 94-109. - Private streets. 
(a)  Generally. The city shall review and consider all development projects where private streets are proposed to be developed which would provide access to any residential building, dwelling unit or any part thereof or any commercial building, which is located more than 120 feet from the nearest city street to which the private street intersects. The city will review and consider any proposed project where a private street is intended to serve two or more separate lots or individual building sites designed for sale to the general public. 
(b)  General arrangement and layout. The pattern or layout of the street system in any project should provide for the following basic design concepts: 
(1)  Provide adequate vehicular access to all buildings and facilities within the plat boundaries. 
(2)  Provide adequate interior traffic circulation and access to all buildings containing dwelling units by firefighting personnel and equipment as approved by the fire official. 
(3)  Provide adequate access to the existing public street system adjacent to the boundaries of the plat. 
(4)  Be so designed to allow for the smooth flow of vehicular traffic, avoiding such traffic hazards as closely off-set intersections, angular and multiple point intersections, jogs and other design features which would induce a hazard to vehicular traffic and the occupants of the project. 
(c)  Width. Since private streets are established without the benefit of a formalized right-of-way width, the width of a private street is considered by the city to be the width of the surface of the pavement measured from edge to edge. Under these circumstances, the right-of-way width and the pavement width of a private street are considered coterminous and the terms are used interchangeably. It is the policy of the city that the minimum acceptable unobstructed width of any private street should not be less than 27 feet. If designated parking is proposed along the private street, additional width may be required to accommodate such parking. 
(d)  Dead-ends, culs-de-sac and T-type turnarounds. Dead-end private streets must be terminated by a circular cul-de-sac having a paving radius of not less than 40 feet or a T-type turnaround designed in conformance with the standards approved by the fire department and the public works department. 
(e)  Length of culs-de-sac or dead-end streets. Dead-end private streets must not extend further than 1,000 feet from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting public street measured along the centerline of such private street to the center of the circular turnaround (cul-de-sac) or the outer limit of the paving in the T-type turnaround configuration. 
(f)  Intersections. Private streets must not be direct (straight line) projections of any public street. 
(g)  Multiple access points to public streets. All projects containing private streets must have a private street system so designed to provide adequate emergency vehicular access and the private street system must be designed to provide more than one point of access to the project or development from the public streets adjacent to the boundaries of the project or development in those instances where it is the opinion of the fire official that additional access points will be necessary to insure the safety and general welfare of the public and occupants of the project.

(a)  Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6701d, § 34, pedestrians, facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6701d, § 34, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and may then turn right or, if the intersecting streets are both one-way streets and left turns are permissible, may turn left, after standing until the intersection may be entered safely, yielding right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Traffic not so turning shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. The state transportation commission, municipal authorities, and commissioners courts, within their respective jurisdictions, may prohibit such turns on a steady red signal by posting a notice that turns of that type are prohibited. Such notice shall be erected at such intersection giving notice thereof. 
b.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6701d, § 34, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, this section shall be applicable except as to those subsections which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through an intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(b)  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6701d, § 86.

Customer must show proof leak has been repaired before issuance of adjustment. 
(2)  Any adjustments made to the utility bill shall be made to the cost for sewer service, including base rate and maintenance fee. An adjustment will be made based upon an average of six monthly bills during the previous six-month period. 
(3)  In the event that water usage during the billing period exceeded 50,000 gallons, the cost of water shall be adjusted by one-third (1/3) of the excess water usage based upon an average of six monthly bills during the previous six-month period. Such an adjustment, however, shall only be made for those customers whose monthly bill averages less than 50,000 gallons based upon an average of the preceding 12 months. Any adjustment to the cost of water shall only be made if the customer provides verification that a leak existed and that repairs have been made. 
(4)  In no case shall a sewer adjustment be granted if the city notified the customer of a potential water leak on his/her property. 
(5)  Sewer adjustments will be limited to one per 12-month period.

Trash piles greater than the prescribed four cubic yards must be removed from the property within ten calendar days or violations may be forwarded to the city's code enforcement department for compliance. If the city's code enforcement officer tags the pile in violation, the city solid waste service shall not pick up the trash. The city shall not provide this service to vacant properties or those properties without an active account. Green waste and trash will not be removed if it is co-mingled. 
(4)  Should an owner of property or customer within the city request the removal of trash, the city may do so at a cost equivalent to the actual costs of personnel, equipment, and disposal fees but no less than $20.00 per cubic yard per collection for quantities greater than four cubic yards. Payment must be made to the City prior to the trash being collected. The amount of trash to be collected shall not exceed four cubic yards at any one time. Such service shall be provided at the discretion of the city dependent upon such factors including, but not limited to, existing work load, and scheduling. This provision shall not apply to the accumulation of trash due to work performed by contractors and/or individuals/companies hired by the property owners.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 106-81. - [Notice of prohibited discharges into city sanitary sewer system; repair of defects in private sewer service lines; monthly surcharge for continued violation.] 
(a)  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated that the city conduct a Sanitary Sewer Evaluation Survey (SSES) and the results of the SSES indicated defects on private sewer service lines, which allow for prohibited discharges of rainwater into the city's sanitary sewer system. 
(b)  The EPA has mandated that these defects be corrected in order to minimize prohibited discharges. 
(c)  The city shall serve property owners and/or customers with written notice of defects and provide for repair of such defects within 120 days from the service of said notice. 
(d)  The property owner and/or the customer, once having completed repairs, shall notify the city. The city shall inspect the repairs and, if satisfactory, issue written notice to the property owner and/or customer that compliance has been achieved. 
(e)  If, after such period of time noted in subsection (c) has elapsed, the property owner and/or customer has not repaired the defective line and had such repairs inspected by the city, the city will institute a monthly charge in the amount of $15.00 to cover the cost of treating the prohibited discharge into the city's sanitary sewer system. Such charge will be added to the monthly water, sewer, and garbage bill, for that address, for each and every month such private sewer line defect remains uncorrected. This charge will remain in effect until the property owner and/or customer corrects the defect and contacts the city for an inspection. When the repairs have been approved by the city, the charge shall be henceforth removed from the property owner's and/or customer's bill. Failure to pay said monthly charge will carry the same penalties as normal water, sewer and garbage fees.

(b)  Certificate of necessity required. No permit to operate taxicabs shall be issued by the city until the city council shall, after a hearing duly had, declare by certificate that the public convenience and necessity require the proposed taxicab service for which application for a permit is made. 
(c)  Determining necessity. In determining whether public convenience and necessity require the licensing of such taxicabs for which application is made, the city council shall take into consideration whether the demands for public convenience and necessity require such proposed or such additional taxicab service within the city; the financial responsibility of the applicant; the number, kind, type and ownership of equipment; the increased traffic congestion on the streets which may result; and whether the safe use of the public streets by the public, both vehicular and pedestrian, will be unduly endangered by the granting of such additional permit; and such other relevant facts as the city council may deem advisable or necessary, which may throw light on the public necessity and convenience. In connection therewith: 
(1)  The number of permanent taxicabs in the city shall be limited to a number equal to one per 10,000 in population for the city and the city shall not issue any license or permit which would permit the operation of taxicabs in excess of such number. For the purposes of this section, a major fraction of 10,000 shall be construed sufficient to warrant an additional taxicab; and 
(2)  The city clerk department is hereby charged with the responsibility of determining the yearly population of the city, which determination is to be made in a report by the city clerk on or after January 1st of each year. 
(3)  The city shall not increase the number of taxicab licenses or permits until such population report has been received by the city clerk department, and only then if the population report warrants the increase as per this section.

The notice shall state that application has been filed for a taxicab permit, setting forth the name of the applicant, kind of equipment, and ownership of the same, and all other pertinent data set forth in the application which the city council may deem necessary. Such publication shall constitute a notice to all holders of existing taxicab permits that a public hearing will be held by the city council at a public place in the city, to be the designated time given in the notice. The designated time shall not be less than five business days nor more than 15 business days after the date of the first publication of the notice, and the notice shall be published on two consecutive weeks at the taxicab owner's expense. All holders of taxicab permits or any other citizens shall thereupon be entitled to file any complaints or protests that the party may see fit. In all such hearings the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to establish by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the public convenience and necessity require such operation of the vehicles for which application has been made. 
(e)  Issuance of certificate. If the city council finds from investigation and hearing that the public convenience and necessity justify the operation of the vehicles for which the permit is desired, the taxicab inspector shall notify the applicant of finding, and, within five days thereafter, the applicant shall furnish to the inspector of taxicabs all relevant information which may be required. If the inspector of taxicabs then finds that the applicant is the owner of the vehicles for which the permit is desired, as the term "owner" is defined in this article, such inspector shall require of such applicant a policy of insurance as provided in this article. If such inspector shall further find that such policy of insurance has been filed, and approved as provided in this article, and such vehicles comply with, and the applicant has complied with, all relevant ordinances of the city, and all of the rules and regulations established to more effectively carry out the purpose and intent of this article, the inspector shall issue a written certificate to the city clerk certifying that the public convenience and necessity require the operation of such taxicabs, or any less number thereof which the applicant desires and proposes to operate, and that the applicant is entitled to have such vehicles permitted as taxicabs upon complying with all other provisions of this article. 
(f)  Denial of certificate. If the city council finds as a result of the investigation and hearing required by this article, that the public convenience and necessity do not justify the operation of the taxicab for which a permit is desired, the inspector of taxicabs shall forthwith notify the applicant of such a finding.

SECTION 14. - SPECIFIC USE PROVISIONS 

Section 14.1. - Purpose. 
    A specific use permit, when granted, allows the use of property that may be, based on location, characteristics of a site, and other criteria, compatible with other permitted uses. 
    The city council may, by an affirmative vote, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected, and after recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, adopt an ordinance to allow a specific use permit for property, after finding that the use is in general conformance with the comprehensive plan of the city, and containing such requirements and safeguards as are necessary to protect adjoining property. 
Section 14.2. - Specific uses generally. 
    A specific use permit may be granted for those uses indicated by "S" in the schedule of permitted principal uses. 
Section 14.3. - Approval process and procedure for specific use permits. 
1.  An application for a specific use permit shall be accompanied by a site plan meeting the requirements set forth in site plan approval (section 16) of these regulations. The city shall make available application forms specifying requirements. The city may require additional information or drawings (such as building floor plans), operating data and expert evaluation or testimony concerning the location, function and characteristics of any building or use proposed. 
2.  In considering whether a specific use permit be granted, the planning and zoning commission and city council shall determine that such uses are compatible with structures and uses of abutting property and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration and shall make recommendations as to any conditions for approval. In approving a specific use permit, the planning and zoning commission and city council may consider the following: 
a.  Whether the use is compatible with surrounding existing uses or proposed uses; 
b.  Whether the uses requested by the applicant are normally associated with the permitted uses in the base district; 
c.  Whether the nature of the use is reasonable; 
d.  Whether any negative impact on the surrounding area has been mitigated; 
e.  That any additional conditions specified ensure that the intent of the district purposes is being upheld. 
Section 14.4. - Specific use permit requirements. 
1.  In granting a specific use permit, the planning and zoning commission and city council may impose conditions that shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the chief building official for the building(s) on such property. Such conditions are precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. Any special conditions shall be set forth in writing and made a part of the granting ordinance. A timeline may be imposed as a condition upon the granting of a specific use permit. If a time limit expires, unless the ordinance granting the specific use permit provides for the renewal of the specific use permit, the applicant shall follow these procedures. 
2.  No specific use permit shall be granted unless the applicant, owner and grantee of the specific use permit shall be willing to accept and agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements of the specific use permit, as attached to the site plan drawing (or drawings) and reviewed by the planning and zoning commission and approved by the city council. 
3.  A building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be applied for and secured within six months from the time of granting the specific use permit, provided, however, that the building official may authorize an extension not to exceed six months. After six months from the date of approval has lapsed, unless extended by the building official, the planning and zoning commission and city council may review the site plan for compliance. If the site plan is determined to be invalid, the property owner(s) must submit a new or revised site plan for approval prior to any construction or application for building permit for the area designated for the specific use permit. A public hearing is required for consideration of the new site plan. 
4.  No building, premises, or land use under a specific use permit may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed unless an amended specific use permit is granted for such enlargement, modification, structural alteration, or change. Minor changes or alterations may be approved by the building official, which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, the uses permitted, increase the density, building height, coverage of site, off-street parking ratio, or area regulations provided such changes are not contrary to the approved conditions. 
5.  The board of appeals shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to the granting, extension, revocation, modification or any other action taken relating to such specific use permit. 
6.  When the city council authorizes granting of a specific use permit, the zoning map shall be amended to indicate that the affected area has conditional and limited uses. 
Section 14.5. - Sexually oriented businesses. 
    The city finds that the unrestricted operation of certain sexually oriented businesses may be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and commercial neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity. In addition to the applicable requirements set forth in height and area regulations (section 12), the following regulations apply to sexually oriented businesses (SOB): 
1.  Location. An SOB may be located not closer than 1,000 linear feet from an existing SOB. An SOB cannot be located closer than 1,000 linear feet, measured in a straight line from the nearest property line to the nearest property line, from the following uses that are located within the city:
