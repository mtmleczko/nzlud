PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Richland Hills, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2001 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

However, if any other municipal election is to be held within sixty (60) days of the filing of the petition, the question may be voted on at such election. Pending the holding of such election, such ordinance or resolution shall be suspended from taking effect and shall not later take effect unless a majority of the registered, qualified voters voting thereon at such election shall vote in favor thereof.

Sec. 16.07. - Inconsistent ordinances.

Sec. 17.07. - Notice of injury or damage. 
    Recognizing that cities and other public entities whose operations are not motivated by profit, but rather by service, are unique in turnover of personnel, and that in order to adequately defend the interests of the public the officials must have timely notice of claims against the city, these reasonable rules are adopted.

(3)  Place of occurrence; 
(4)  Extent of injury;

    If such notice is not timely given, no action will lie against the City. The notice called for in this section need not be sworn to or verified but must be signed by the claimant or his attorney and delivered to the Mayor or City Manager, either in person or by certified or registered mail. It shall not suffice to give oral notice nor shall it suffice to deliver or mail the notice to some other employee of the City.

The written notice required herein must be given to one of the officials set out above within six months from the time when the cause of action arose, or the action shall not lie.

If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at that date under a joint and survivor annuity (Option 1) payable during the lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse. 
(3)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.204(b) applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(4)  The rights, credits and benefits authorized in this section shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(5)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a standard occupational disability annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.408 or an optional occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.410 upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to such board of trustees: (i) that the member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; (ii) that the disability is likely to be permanent; and (iii) that the member should be retired.

Within five days of said suspension the city council shall provide written notice to the officer detailing the specific charges being brought against the officer. The city council shall hold a public hearing within 15 days after the written notice to determine whether the charges are well founded, provided, however, that such hearing shall not be held earlier than ten days of the date the officer receives written notice of the charges unless the officer being charged agrees in writing to an earlier date.

(f)  Upon conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall determine whether the officer being charged with violation of this section is guilty or not guilty of such violation by a vote to be determined by a majority of the members present and voting. If the city council determines that the officer being charged with violation of this section is not guilty of such violation, the allegation will be dismissed, and the officer reinstated without penalty. If the city council determines that the officer being charged with violation of this section is guilty of such violation, the city council shall determine the appropriate discipline by a vote to be determined by a majority of the members present and voting. Such discipline may range from a written reprimand, suspension with or without pay, or removal from office. 
(g)  Any violation of this section with the knowledge, express or implied, or persons or corporations contracting with the city shall render the contract voidable by the city council.

In lieu of insertion of such microchip by city animal control staff, the owner may provide evidence of previous insertion of such an identifying microchip in the dog or cat satisfactory to the animal control officer. While microchip insertion will be available for "guard dogs" and "dangerous dogs," such will not alleviate the owner from the responsibility to comply with all provisions of this chapter applicable to such types of animals, including but not limited to the requirements for registration, registration fees, and the wearing of collars and tags.

Sec. 6-241. - Authority of animal control officer to order quarantine of animal. 
    The animal control officer shall have the authority to order the quarantine of animals responsible for bite incidents, or suspected of having any zoonotic disease considered to be a hazard to the human population, or other animals. All animal bite reports shall be investigated by animal control. The animal control officer shall direct the disposition of any animal suspected of being rabid or having any other zoonotic disease considered to be hazardous to any other animal or human being. 
(Ord. No. 810-97, § 7(A), 1-28-1997) 
Sec. 6-242. - Quarantine of animals which have bitten.

The owner shall not permit the animal to come in contact with any other person or animal. The owner shall surrender possession of such animal to the animal control officer on demand for supervised quarantine. Supervised quarantine shall be at the animal shelter or a veterinary hospital. The quarantine shall not be for less than ten days, not including the day of the bite. A release from quarantine may be issued if a veterinarian determines that the quarantined animal does not show the clinical signs of rabies. 
(b)  Any veterinary hospital possessing any quarantined animal shall immediately notify the animal control officer if such animal escapes, or becomes or appears to become sick, or dies; and, in case of death of the animal while under quarantine, shall immediately surrender the dead animal to the animal control officer for diagnostic purposes. 
(c)  Home quarantine may be allowed, but only in the sole discretion of the animal control officer. The animal control officer may allow home quarantine if all criteria therefor in any applicable state laws and regulations are met, and if the animal control officer is satisfied, in the officer's sole discretion, that the animal's owner understands, and will abide by, both the applicable provisions of state law and regulations and the current rules for home quarantine as issued by the Richland Hills Animal Control Division. 
(d)  If the owner of a quarantined animal does not reclaim the animal within four days after the expiration of the quarantine period the animal may be disposed of as described in section 6-241 above. 
INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR HOME 
QUARANTINE 
    Rabies is a virus that is spread through the saliva of a contagious animal. An infected animal is contagious for up to ten days before its death. Infection occurs when the infected saliva comes in contact with blood through a break in the skin. Bites, obviously, but even scratches can be infected with the virus. Soap and water immediately after a bite/scratch is the best prevention of infection, but quarantine of the animal is the only way to know for sure if further steps are needed. The virus spreads slowly from the injury, through the muscle tissue to the nerves and eventually to the brain. The current post exposure rabies vaccine has been 100 percent effective when given before the virus enters the nerve. However after the virus is in the nerve, it cannot be stopped and is 100 percent fatal. This is why quarantine is so important, and the reason that the rules of quarantine must be strictly followed. 
    The following rules must be strictly adhered to in order to limit any potential spread of the virus: 
(1)  The animal must be isolated from all persons except for the person feeding or otherwise caring for the animal. The animal must be kept in a separate room, garage or outside pen, and no access is to be allowed to anyone other than the caregiver. Any people exposed to the animal will most likely be required to receive the post exposure shots if the animal tests positive for rabies. 
(2)  The quarantined animal cannot be moved to any location other than that approved in writing by the city. If the caregiver cannot be available to tend the animal, or the animal must be moved, the animal shall be taken to the animal services center or a veterinarian. 
(3)  The quarantined animal shall not be allowed in the same room, yard or pen with any other animal. Chain link fencing is not adequate separation between the quarantined animal and other animals in the yard or on adjacent property because chain link fencing allows nose-to-nose contact. 
(4)  The quarantined animal must not be allowed to escape, taken for walks on a leash, or released for a nature call. 
(5)  The quarantined animal must be checked by a veterinarian on the first and last day of the quarantine confinement. 
(Ord. No. 810-97, § 7(B), 1-28-1997; Ord. No. 894-01, § I, 4-10-2001) 
Sec. 6-243. - Killing or removing animal suspected of rabies or placed under quarantine prohibited. 
    Without permission of the animal control officer, it shall be unlawful for any person to kill or remove from the city limits any animal that has bitten a person or other animal, or that is placed under quarantine, except when it is necessary to kill such animal to protect the life of any person or other animal. 
(Ord. No. 810-97, § 7(C), 1-28-1997) 
Sec. 6-244. - Surrender of carcasses of dead animals suspected of rabies. 
    The carcass of any dead animal exposed to rabies, or suspected of having been rabid, shall, upon demand, be surrendered to the animal control officer.

Cross reference- Solid waste, ch. 66. 
Sec. 6-245. - Disposition of animals exposed to rabies. 
(a)  Any person having knowledge of the existence of any animal known to have been, or suspected of being, exposed to rabies must immediately report such knowledge to the animal control officer or city health inspector, giving any information which may be required. For any animal known to have been, or suspected of being, exposed to rabies, the animal shall be handled in one of the following manners: 
(1)  Humane destruction, with notification to, or under supervision of, the animal control officer; 
(2)  If not currently vaccinated, quarantine in a veterinary hospital for at least 90 days immediately following the date of the exposure; or 
(3)  If currently vaccinated, immediate revaccination and quarantine for at least 45 days immediately following the date of exposure. 
(b)  If a veterinarian determines that a quarantined animal does not show the clinical signs of rabies, it may be released to the owner prior to or upon the expiration of the quarantine period; provided the owner has paid all of the reasonable cost of such quarantine and any veterinarian bills. However, if the quarantined animal does show clinical signs of rabies, the animal shall be humanely destroyed and its head or brain submitted to the nearest laboratory, certified by the state department of health for rabies testing. 
(c)  No wild animals will be placed in quarantine. All wild animals will be humanely destroyed in such a manner that the brain is not mutilated. The brain will then be submitted to a laboratory, certified for rabies diagnosis, in order to be tested.

For purposes of this section, a rental residence is defined as any residential unit located in any building containing from one- to four-family residential units, any part of which is: (i) rented, leased or otherwise occupied for a fee by a person other than the owner or the owner's immediate family immediately prior to the time the residence becomes vacant, or (ii) to be rented, leased or otherwise occupied by a person other than the owner or the owner's immediate family. A rental residence shall be considered vacant when either of the following conditions exist:

(2)  When any utility service is shut off or transferred to a new occupant's name because of change of occupants. 
(b)  Certificate of occupancy required. When a rental residence becomes vacant, before the residence may again be occupied, the owner must obtain a current certificate of occupancy from the city, unless the owner already holds a current and valid certificate of occupancy. For purposes of this chapter, a certificate of occupancy for a rental residence shall be considered current and valid for one year from the date of issuance. 
(c)  Rental inspection. 
(1)  All rental residences will be subject to inspection for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the minimum housing standards set forth in this Code. 
(2)  Once a rental property becomes vacant, the rental residence shall be inspected prior to being occupied again, unless an inspection has occurred within the previous 12-month period. The property may also be inspected at any time if a complaint is received by a tenant or owner of the property. The property may also be inspected at any time if staff determines that justifiable probable cause exists. 
(3)  The city is authorized to obtain a warrant to conduct an inspection permitted by this section when consent to enter the property has been refused or otherwise cannot be obtained. 
(d)  Enforcement. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to rent or lease a rental residence to any other person unless a current certificate of occupancy has been issued. If the inspection by the building inspector reveals the building is not in compliance with this section, the building inspector shall give notice of noncompliance to the owner who shall bring the building into compliance within ten days of the date of the notice. 
(2)  The owner must obtain all permits required for the work needed to bring the building into compliance with this section. 
(3)  A building that is under a substandard building order by the city building board of appeals shall be repaired or demolished pursuant to that order rather than this subsection. 
(e)  Inspection procedures and fees. 
(1)  When a residence is inspected under the provisions of this section, the owner of the property shall pay an inspection fee to the city as provided in the fee schedule contained in appendix A to this Code. An inspection fee will be charged for each time the inspector is prevented from inspecting the building though no fault of the city, including but not limited to the failure of the owner or the owner's representative to meet the inspector at the residence at the appointed time. 
(2)  The building inspector will not inspect a building unless the owner or a representative of the owner, who is at least 18 years of age, is present. 
(f)  Exceptions from authority to prevent occupancy. The chief building official shall not prevent occupancy of a rental residence because of a violation of chapter 34 of this Code, unless, in the judgment and of the chief building official, the violation presents a serious and immediate danger to the general public or the occupants of such residence, but shall enforce such violation through the enforcement mechanisms provided in chapter 34 and other provisions of this Code and state law.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-171. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the general health, public safety and welfare, comfort, convenience and protection of the city and the residents of the city by: 
(1)  Prohibiting door-to-door solicitation and canvassing activity at residences during the times when such activity is most intrusive and disruptive to citizens' privacy; 
(2)  Regulating the manner in which any solicitation activity, canvassing activity or handbill distribution may occur to promote good order, prevent litter and protect citizens from aggressive and intimidating practices; and 
(3)  Requiring solicitors to register with the city to aid crime detection and deter deceptive practices and fraud. 
    The provisions of this article shall be construed to accomplish these purposes. 
(Ord. No. 1245-13, § 1, 4-16-2013) 
Sec. 18-172. - Definitions. 
    In this article: 
    Administrator means the assistant police chief or some other employee of the City of Richland Hills designated by the chief of police. 
    Canvasser means a person who engages in canvassing activities. 
    Canvassing or canvassing activity means the act of: 
(1)  Traveling either by foot or vehicle, going door-to-door, house-to-house, building-to-building; or 
(2)  Occupying space in or traveling on or through any public place in the city; and personally contacting persons to communicate in any manner, whether orally, by written or printed materials including, but not limited to, handbills, leaflets, hand signing or by any other method, direct or implied, for any purpose other than selling or taking orders for goods, wares, merchandise or services or collecting money. 
    City means the City of Richland Hills, Texas. 
    City manager means the city manager of the city. 
    City secretary means the city secretary of the city. 
    Dark means the time of day identified by the United States Naval Observatory as being after the end of civil twilight on a particular day in the city. 
    Handbill means any printed or written matter, any sample or device, dodger, circular, leaflet, pamphlet, paper, booklet, or any other printed or otherwise reproduced original or copies of any manner. 
    Handbill distribution means traveling either by foot or vehicle, going door-to-door, house-to-house or building-to-building without personally contacting persons to distribute or leave on or at each premises handbills for any purpose. 
    Minor means a person who has not been emancipated and who is under the age of 17. 
    Nonprofit organization means an organization or entity that is exempt from the payment of tax pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    Police chief means the police chief of the city. 
    Selling means to sell, dispense, peddle, display, offer to sell or solicit for sale by offering or exposing for sale any goods, wares, merchandise or services. 
    Solicitation activities means traveling either by foot or vehicle, going door-to-door, house-to-house or building-to-building personally contacting persons to ask, barter or communicate in any manner, whether orally, by written or printed materials including but not limited to, handbills or leaflets, hand signing or by any other method, direct or implied, for the purpose of selling or taking orders for goods, wares, merchandise or services or collecting money for any purpose. 
    Solicitor means a person who engages in solicitation activities. 
    Traffic safety vest means a high visibility vest made of fluorescent orange or yellow material that may be clearly seen at any time of the day. 
    This article establishes different rules depending upon whether a person going door-to-door is classified as a solicitor, a canvasser, or a handbill distributor. By way of example only and to further explain the difference between each classification, a person leaving written material or information of any kind (advertising goods and services, political material, or religious information for example) on a door without contacting occupants of the premises is a handbill distributor. If a person going door-to-door knocks on the door and hands the written material to the occupant or engages the occupant in conversation, the person is a canvasser. If the person going door-to-door knocks on the door and hands written material to the occupant, or engages the occupant in conversation and asks for money in exchange for goods and services, a political campaign, a charity or for any purpose, then the person is a solicitor.

(Ord. No. 901-01, § I(m), 6-26-2001)

When the chief of police is authorized to suspend a license under this section, the chief shall give the licensee the opportunity to pay a reinstatement fee, rather than have the license suspended. Payment of this reinstatement fee shall be considered an administrative admission of the violation. However, this shall not be used as an admission of guilt in a criminal prosecution under this article. If the licensee does not pay the reinstatement fee before the expiration of the third working day after notification, he loses the opportunity to pay it and the chief of police shall impose the suspension.

(8)  A licensee is delinquent in payment to the city for hotel occupancy taxes, ad valorem taxes, or sales taxes related to the sexually oriented business. 
The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license. Subsection 18-346(7) does not apply to adult motels as grounds for revoking the license unless the licensee or employee knowingly allowed the act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation, masturbation, or sexual contact to occur in a public place or within public view. When the chief of police revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license for one year from the date revocation became effective. If, subsequent to revocation, the chief of police finds that the basis for the revocation has been corrected or abated, the applicant may be granted a license if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective. If the license was revoked under subsection 18-346(5), an applicant may not be granted another license until the appropriate number of years required under subsection 18-342(11)b. has elapsed.

The chief of police shall review the response before rendering a decision. 
(3)  The chief of police shall give written notice of such decision to the applicant or licensee. 
(4)  The decision by the chief of police is effective immediately and final pending any appeal.

Notice may also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall be mailed to the address listed in the license application for receipt of notice.

Except where otherwise required by law, this information shall not be subject to public inspection. Public interest is served by not disclosing this information to the public and the interest in protecting this information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosing this information. 
(Ord. No. 1278-14, § 2, 7-1-2014) 
Sec. 30-95. - Government immunity. 
    An alarm permit is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response.

    Special flood hazard area See Area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Sections 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 42-33. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Richland Hills are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 1182-10, § 1, 9-28-2010; Ord. No. 1386-19, § 1, 3-25-2019) 
Sec. 42-34. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Sec. 42-35. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in division 2, subsection 42-64(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article division 1, section 42-34. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: (i) the criteria outlined in division 2, subsections 42-65(a)-(i) are met; and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation, provided, however, that the city and the floodplain administrator shall encourage the property owner to design and construct any new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure to have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in division 2, subsection 42-64(a)(3), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy, provided, however, that the city and the floodplain administrator shall encourage the property owner to design and construct any new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure to have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

Sec. 42-89. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least one foot if no depth number is specified); provided, however, that the city and the floodplain administrator shall encourage the property owner to design and construct any new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure to have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least one foot if no depth number is specified); provided, however, that the city and the floodplain administrator shall encourage the property owner to design and construct any new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure to have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in division 2, section 42-64 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(5)  Where BFE data are utilized in zone A, obtain and maintain records of the lowest floor and floodproofing elevations for new and substantially improved construction. 
(6)  In riverine areas, notify adjacent communities of watercourse alterations and relocations. 
(7)  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no encroachment may increase the base flood level more than one foot. 
(8)  In zones AO and AH, require drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide water away from structures. 
(Ord. No. 1182-10, § 1, 9-28-2010; Ord. No. 1386-19, § 1, 3-25-2019) 
Sec. 42-90. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 42-90(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS 

Sec. 42-151. - Application of standards. 
(a)  Developments which increase the amount of impermeable area, such as the construction of roof structures, paved areas or compacted areas, shall be subject to the terms of this article. The following, however, shall not be included: 
(1)  Modification of single-family dwellings which will continue to be used as single-family dwellings; and 
(2)  Improvement of existing roadways which does not increase the number of traffic lanes in the typical cross section of the roadway. 
(b)  The maximum controlled stormwater runoff release rate shall not exceed the natural safe stormwater drainage capacity of the downstream system, which has been determined by Storm Drainage Evaluation, dated July, 1982, by Owen Ayers & Associates, Inc., which is on file in the office of the city secretary. Pipe outlets of less than 12 inches in diameter shall not be allowed. Multiple outlets from a stormwater storage area shall be avoided if they are designed to be less than 12 inches in diameter. Removable orifice plates shall be employed when these pipe size requirements cannot be met. 
(c)  When the maximum controlled stormwater runoff release rate shall be exceeded, any or all of the following stormwater storage methods shall be provided and constructed: 
(1)  Dry bottom stormwater storage. 
a.  Dry bottom stormwater storage areas must be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space, or similar type of use, which will not be adversely affected by occasional intermittent flooding. 
b.  The combination of storage of major floodwater runoff from a 100-year return frequency storm and the allowable release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48 hours. 
c.  Minimum grades for turf areas shall be one-half percent (200 units horizontal to one vertical) and maximum side slopes shall be 30 percent (three units horizontal to one unit vertical). Storage area side slopes shall follow the natural land contours as closely as practicable, and a minimum of earth excavation shall be used to create the storage facility. 
d.  Temporary seeding or other soil stabilization measures shall be established in the stormwater storage area and major floodwater passageway immediately following the construction or reconstruction of these areas. During the construction of the overall development, it is recognized that a limited amount of sediment buildup may occur in the stormwater storage area due to erosion. In no case shall the volume of the storage area be reduced to less than three-quarters of the required volume during the construction phase of the development. 
e.  Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding, conventional seeding, nurse crops, fertilizing or sod installation shall be utilized to control soil movement and erosion within the storage area and major flood water passageway. These measures shall meet or exceed the standards established by the soil and water conservation district. The installation of these permanent measures shall take place only after the majority of construction and other silt and sediment producing activities have been completed. Prior to the establishment of the permanent erosion control measures, the required capacity of the stormwater storage area and the excess stormwater passageway shall be restored. 
f.  The control structure shall be provided with an interceptor for trash and debris and it shall be designed and constructed to prevent soil erosion and not to require manual adjustments for its proper operation. An inlet design that will produce turbulent flow conditions during any portion of the stormwater storage cycle will not be acceptable. 
g.  Adequate impact stilling basins shall be provided to ensure that downstream soil erosion is alleviated and the regime of the downstream drainage facility is not disturbed. 
h.  Each stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of overflow in the event a storm in excess of the design capacity occurs. This overflow facility shall be constructed to function without specific attention and can become a part of the excess stormwater passageway described in this subsection. 
i.  The entire stormwater storage area shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare. If a condition occurs in the stormwater storage area which is hazardous to the public health, safety or welfare, the person responsible for the condition will be required to provide approved corrective measures. In the event these corrective measures are not provided, the city may eliminate the hazard at the expense of the person responsible. 
j.  Low flow conduits or channels shall be provided in stormwater storage areas; these conduits or channels shall be so constructed that they will not interfere with the secondary usage of the storage areas and will reduce the frequency of time that the storage area will be covered with water. 
(2)  Wet bottom stormwater storage. Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed in compliance with all of the regulations which are applicable and govern the construction of dry bottom stormwater storage areas. The following additional regulations shall apply: 
a.  The water surface area of the permanent pool shall not exceed one-tenth of the area of the tributary watershed. 
b.  Protection of the shoreline must be provided to alleviate soil erosion due to wave action. 
c.  Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. 
d.  Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. 
e.  The control structure for stormwater release shall be designed to operate at full design release rate with only a minor increase in the water depth in order to minimize the land surface wetted by frequent minor stormwater runoff conditions. 
f.  Measures shall be included in the design to prevent pond stagnation. This may be accomplished by fountain aeration or some other method used to ensure aerobic pond conditions. 
g.  The volume of water permanently stored shall not be considered to be part of the required excess stormwater storage volume. 
(3)  Paved stormwater storage. Design and construction of the pavement base must ensure that there is not pavement damage due to flooding. Control structures in paved areas must be readily accessible for maintenance and cleaning. Vortex control devices will be required. 
(4)  Rooftop stormwater storage. Rooftop storage of excess water shall be designed and constructed to provide permanent control inlets and parapet walls to contain excess stormwater. Adequate structural roof design must be provided to ensure that roof deflection does not occur which could cause the roofing material to fail and result in leakage. Overflow areas must be provided to ensure that the weight of stored stormwater will never exceed the structural capacity of the roof. 
(5)  Automobile parking stormwater storage areas. Automobile parking facilities used to store excess water must be constructed having a maximum depth of stored stormwater of 11/2 feet and these areas shall be located in the most remote, least used areas of the parking facility. 
(6)  Underground stormwater storage. Underground stormwater storage facilities must be designed for easy access in order to remove accumulated sediment and debris. These facilities must be provided with a positive gravity outlet. 
(d)  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed and their construction supervised by a registered professional engineer. Furthermore, compliance with this section shall be as provided for in subsection 42-133(a). In addition, upon completion of construction, a set of as-built drawings certified by a registered professional engineer and an estimated schedule of development phases shall be required by the city. 
(Code 1984, ch. 3, § 7, art. II(D)) 
Sec. 42-152. - Calculating stormwater storage volumes. 
(a)  The volume of required stormwater storage shall be calculated on the basis of the maximum value achieved from the runoff of a 100-year return frequency storm less the volume of water released through the outlet structure. Any generally recognized and substantiated method acceptable to the city may be used for these calculations. The release rate of the outlet structure when only half of the storage area is filled may be used in lieu of routing techniques in small drainage areas. The control structure shall be designed to maintain as uniform a flow as possible, independent of the stormwater storage volume. Where the proposed structure, project or land development forms only a portion of a watershed or contains portions of several watersheds, the storage volume calculations shall be based upon the area of the entire project, development or land use change. The maximum release rate shall not exceed that computed in the Drainage System Evaluation Report, July, 1982, on file in the office of the city secretary. 
(b)  Stormwater storage areas which will be filled to capacity by high frequency storms shall be designed in a manner that will protect immediate downstream properties, and all overflow structures shall be designed to function properly and effectively without the necessity of making manual adjustments. A larger outlet for a stormwater storage area may be permitted by the city for the orderly management of stormwater runoff where large tributary areas are developed without detention. 
(c)  If the orderly management of the stormwater runoff cannot be achieved by passing the entire tributary area runoff through the stormwater storage area, then the stormwater storage area shall be constructed to exclude the runoff from the tributary area originating outside the area to be developed.

The city reserves the right to make reasonable adjustments to the access line fee, with 180 days notice, but not to exceed ten percent in any one year. 
Amounts appearing above are used to calculate the total compensation due the city and are not to be construed as the setting of a charge for end users. 
To the extent allowed by law, and not at the direction or request of the city, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Utilities Code § 54.206, a provider has the discretion to collect the access line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this article through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including from any other persons who are leasing, reselling, rebundling or otherwise using the providers access lines to provide telecommunications service. 
For purposes of this section only, lines terminating at customers with "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated, but provider shall provide information on the number of such lines upon request by the city. 
b.  Number of access lines. Subject to city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, provider agrees to provide annually or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by provider that are serving premises within the city. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of provider's access lines serving premises within the city. Upon written request, provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all noncustomer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(2)  Minimum annual fee. Notwithstanding any other provision in this article, for all new installations of facilities placed in, on or under the public rights-of-way from the effective date of the municipal consent and for each calendar year period thereafter, the provider shall pay the city a minimum annual public street crossing fee of either the greater of: 
a.  The access line fee; or 
b.  The amount set out in appendix A. 
This annual minimum fee is to compensate the city for the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way used by the provider, and to recover the administrative cost in monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this article and of the municipal consent. Each municipal consent shall provide that the minimum fee of subsection (2)b. above may be adjusted once every three years by the city in its sole reasonable discretion to properly reflect the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way and administrative cost to the city, but such adjustment shall not exceed $100.00 in any one three-year period. 
(3)  Confidential records. If the provider notifies the city by a conspicuous written notation of the confidential nature of any information (including, but not limited to the information in subsection (2) of this section), reports, documents or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings, the city shall notify the provider of the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall furnish the provider with copies of all requests for attorney general opinions pertaining to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings, and shall furnish the provider with copies of attorney general opinion requests as soon as practicable that may pertain to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(4)  No other fees. The payments due under this article shall be in lieu of any construction, building or other permit, approval, inspection or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business permit fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the public rights-of-way against persons operating businesses similar to that of a provider. Further, such access line fee shall constitute full compensation to the city for all provider's facilities located within the public rights-of-way, including interoffice-transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the public rights-of-way fee. The compensation paid is not in lieu of any generally applicable ad valorem taxes, sales taxes or other generally applicable taxes, fees, development impact fees or charges, or other statutory charges or expenses recoverable under the state public utility regulatory act or successor statutes. 
(5)  Uncollectibles. Any other provision of this agreement notwithstanding, provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points the revenues for which remain uncollectible. 
(6)  Payments by or use of the network by other telecommunications carriers and providers. 
a.  Direct payment-Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers who purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities or services for the purpose of rebundling those facilities and/or services to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city ("rebundler"), must pay to the city the access line fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate access line fee, as specified in section 46-41, to each access line created by rebundling telecommunications service or facilities. Direct payment further ensures that the access line fee imposed in this article can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this article notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any facilities or services provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications service, if the telecommunications service provider who is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the provider that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If provider provides a copy of the signed statement to the city from the rebundler which is acceptable to the city, then provider is absolved of all responsibility for the access line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city by each such rebundler. 
b.  Indirect payments-Public rights-of-way fee application to use of network by others. With respect to any person leasing, resellings or otherwise using a provider's access lines, if a provider believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher access line fee may be applied until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the provider sufficient written information to determine the correct access line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the access line fee, the provider may, at its discretion and not at the city's request, bill the person on the basis of the information provided. The provider shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as the city first obtains written permission of such other person for provider to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this article notwithstanding, however, a provider shall not be liable for underpayment of access line fees resulting from the provider's reliance upon the written information provided by any person who uses provider's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 11, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-42. - City payment due dates. 
(a)  Access line fee. A provider shall remit the access line fee on a quarterly basis together with the certified statement required in subsection 46-41(1)a.1. Payment shall be made on or before the 45th day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated and shall be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by the city manager. 
(b)  Minimum fee payment. This fee per subsection 46-41(2), if applicable, shall be due on January 31 of every year of the consent agreement. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 12, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-43. - Audits. 
(a)  On 30 days notice to a provider the city may audit a provider for a period of time to the fullest extent allowed by law. The provider shall furnish information to demonstrate its compliance with the municipal consent and/or other provisions of this article. 
(b)  A provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of business and operations that cumulatively reflect the monthly count of all access lines for a period of seven years. The city manager may require the keeping of additional records or accounts that are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting the number of access lines used to deliver telecommunication services or for calculation of the payments due hereunder. The city may examine the provider's books and records referred to in this section, expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq., to the extent such records reasonably relate to providing information to verify compliance with this article and the municipal consent. 
(c)  A provider shall make available to the city or the city's designated agent (hereinafter "agent"), for the city or it's agent to examine, audit, review and copy, in the city, on the city manager's written request, its books and records referred to in this section, including papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other provider records that pertain to municipal consent conditions and requirements obtained under this article. A provider shall fully cooperate in making records available and otherwise assist the city examiner. The city examiner shall not inspect or copy or otherwise demand production of customer specific information or any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2701 et seq. 
(d)  The city manager may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to providers' performance of the terms and conditions of a municipal consent conveyed under this article. Providers shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(e)  Upon written request by the city manager, to the extent the documents are reasonably identified, providers shall furnish to the city within 30 business days from the date of the written request copies of all public petitions, applications, written communications and reports submitted by providers, to the FCC and/or to the PUC or their successor agencies, relating to any matters affecting the physical use of city public rights-of-way. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall be continuing and shall survive the termination of a municipal consent granted under this article and shall extend beyond the term of the municipal consent granted to the provider and the city shall have all the rights described in this section for so long as provider is providing any telecommunications service within the city. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 13, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-44. - Transfer. 
(a)  No municipal consent nor any rights or privileges that a provider has under a municipal consent, or the facilities held by a provider for use under such municipal consent which are in the public rights-of-way, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by the provider, either separately or collectively, to any other person without the prior written approval of the city by ordinance or resolution. The city's approval shall be based upon the transferee providing adequate information to the city that it has the ability to perform and comply with the obligations and requirements of the municipal consent. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should a provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its municipal consent, including such provider's telecommunications network, or attempt to do so, without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the provider's municipal consent for default, in which event all rights and interest of the provider under the municipal consent shall cease. 
(b)  Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable. Any change of control of a provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. However, such a change in control shall not void the municipal consent as to the transferee, unless and until the city has given notice that such a change in control necessitates compliance with this section. If the provider does not initiate compliance with this section by a request for municipal consent within 30 days after the above notice has been given by the city, the municipal consent shall be null and unenforceable as to the transferee. 
(c)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a provider upon a change of 15 percent or greater in the ownership of such provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer which requires consent of the city. 
(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every municipal consent granted under this section shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required access line fees or minimum fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by failure to accurately count or report the number of access lines by a provider is prohibited. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section, if the city has not approved or denied a request to transfer under this section within 120 days of written notice of such request from the provider to the city, it shall be deemed approved. Such time frame may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a provider may transfer, without city approval, the facilities in the public rights-of-way under a municipal consent to another provider who has a municipal consent under this article. The provider transferring the facilities remains subject to all applicable obligations and provisions of the municipal consent unless the provider to which the facilities are transferred is also subject to such applicable obligations and provisions. The provider transferring the facilities must give written notice of the transfer to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 14, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-45. - Notices to city. 
(a)  A provider shall notify the city manager as is provided in the municipal consent agreement. 
(b)  A provider shall give written notice to the city not later than 15 days before a transfer or change in operations that may affect the applicability of sections 46-48 through 46-51 to the provider. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 15, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-46. - Circumvention of fee prohibited. 
    A person may not circumvent payment of access line fees or evade payment of such fees by bartering, transfer of rights or by any other means that result in undercounting a provider's number of lines. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed lines are reported in accordance with section 46-41. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 16, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-47. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A provider is subject to the reasonable regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property under state and federal laws. A provider is subject to city ordinances and requirements and federal and state laws and regulations in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  At the city's request, a provider shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of facilities performed by the provider in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  The construction, expansion, reconstruction, excavation, use, maintenance and operation of a provider's facilities within the public rights-of-way are subject to applicable city requirements. 
(1)  A provider may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A provider shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations of other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the provider. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A provider shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(3)  A provider must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the provider's facilities. Once a permit is issued, provider shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the listed activities on its network in this section, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the provider to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the listed activities in this section, on or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (c)(10) of this section, will subject the provider to a stop work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to the city's Code of Ordinances. If the provider fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the provider will be required to obtain another permit. 
(4)  When a provider completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the provider shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance or repair of the provider's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work. 
(5)  Upon failure of a provider to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the provider, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the provider, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the provider will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(6)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a provider shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided in this article. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city determines that the failure of a provider to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. A provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(8)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least 15 days, subject to subsection (d) of this section, before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(9)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a provider shall remove or abate the provider's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The provider and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the provider, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the provider, without paying compensation to the provider and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(10)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person ("emergency conditions"), a provider may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager or designee shall be notified immediately regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the provider shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(11)  Within 60 days of completion of each new permitted section of a provider's facilities, the provider shall supply the city with a complete set of "as built" drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of the provider's business and as reasonably prescribed by the city and allowed by law. 
(12)  The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a provider, as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager or his designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the provider or providers to an unreasonable increase in risk of service interruption, an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 17, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-48. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, to do underground and overhead work, attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a provider, and to change the curb, sidewalks or the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If, during the term of a municipal consent, the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the provider. If the city closes or abandons a public right-of-way that contains a portion of a provider's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public right-of-way subject to the rights conveyed in the municipal consent. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, a provider shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of provider's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the provider. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with provider before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city or other governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a providers recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with provider. If the provider fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the provider may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in the city Code of Ordinances, now or hereafter enacted. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection, the city manager and a provider may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided in this subsection if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(e)  During the term of its municipal consent, a provider may trim trees in or over the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its network. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the provider, its contractor or agent, fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. 
(f)  A provider shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the city gives written notice of not less than 48 hours. The expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefitting from the temporary rearrangements. The provider may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary move. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 18, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-49. - Insurance requirements. 
(a)  A provider shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in the state acceptable to the city throughout the term of a municipal consent conveyed under this article. A provider shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of filing the acceptance of a municipal consent. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements during the effective period of a municipal consent, and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state or letters written by the provider in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required in this section. However, for the city to accept such letters, the provider must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. The city's current insurance requirements are described in Exhibit A which is not set out in this Code but which is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the city. 
(b)  A provider shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the provider or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name of the city and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage; 
(2)  Provide for 30 days notice to the city for cancellation, nonrenewal or material change; 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail; and 
(4)  Provide that the terms of the municipal consent which impose obligations on the provider concerning liability, duty and standard of care, including the indemnity section, are included in the policy and that the risks are insured within the policy terms and conditions. 
(d)  A provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager during the term of a municipal consent or an extension or renewal. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. A provider shall immediately advise the city attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the provider and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 19, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-50. - Indemnity. 
(a)  Each municipal consent granted under this article shall contain provisions whereby the provider agrees to promptly defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses or expenses (i) for the repair, replacement or restoration of city's property, equipment, materials, structures and facilities which are damaged, destroyed or found to be defective solely as a result of the provider's acts or omissions (ii) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action and judgments for (a) damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but not limited to the provider, its agents, officers, employees and subcontractors, city's agents, officers and employees and third parties); and/or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services or loss of income or wages to any person (including, but not limited to the agents, officers and employees of the provider, provider's subcontractors and city and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from the negligent or willful act or omissions of the provider, its agents, employees and/or subcontractors in the performance of activities pursuant to such municipal consent. 
(b)  No municipal consent indemnity provision shall apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors. 
(c)  The provisions of the required indemnity provision set forth in an individual municipal consent shall provide that: 
(1)  It is solely for the benefit of the parties to the municipal consent and is not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity; 
(2)  To the extent permitted by law, any payments made to, or on behalf of, the city under the provisions of this section are subject to the rights granted to providers under V.T.C.A., Utilities Code §§ 54.204-54.206; and 
(3)  Subject to the continued applicability of the provisions of V.T.C.A., Utilities Code §§ 54.204-54.206, as set forth in subsection (c)(2) of this section, the provisions of the indemnity shall survive the expiration of the municipal consent. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 20, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-51. - Renewal of municipal consent. 
    A provider shall request a renewal of a municipal consent by making written application to the city manager at least 90 days before the expiration of the consent. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 21, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-52. - Annexation and disannextion. 
    Within 30 days following the date of the passage of any action affecting the annexation of any property to or the disannexation of any property from the city's corporate boundaries, the city agrees to furnish provider written notice of the action and an accurate map of the city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For the purpose of compensating the city under this article, a provider shall start including or excluding access lines within the affected area in the provider's count of access lines on the effective date designated by the state comptroller of public accounts for the imposition of state local sales and use taxes, but in no case less than 30 days from the date the provider is notified by the city of the annexation or disannexation. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 22, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-53. - Severability. 
    The provisions of this article are severable. However, in the event this article or any tariff that authorizes the provider to recover the fees provided for this article or any procedure provided in this article or any compensation due the city under this article becomes unlawful or is declared or determined by a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, illegal or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, or is exchanged for another means of compensation under higher authority, the provider and city shall meet and negotiate a new agreement that is in compliance with the authority's decision or enactment. Unless explicitly prohibited, the new agreement shall provide the city with a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this article as long as the agreed to compensation is recoverable by the provider in a manner permitted by law for the unexpired portion of the term of this article. 
(Ord. No. 852-99, § 23, 1-26-1999) 
Sec. 46-54. - Governing law. 
    This article shall be construed in accordance with the city Code or codes in effect on the date of passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived to the extent that such Code or codes are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the state, subject to the city's ongoing authority to adopt reasonable regulations to manage its public rights-of-way, pursuant to sections 46-47 and 46-48 or as otherwise provided by law. Municipal consents entered into pursuant to this article are performable in the county.

Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this section, not to exceed the "initial permitted per channel charge" or the "subsequent permitted per channel charge" as described in this section, or the equipment charges as specified in section 46-87, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 46-87. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this article, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that (i) the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and (ii) this article has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this article, rates "in effect on the initial date of regulation" or "in effect on September 30, 1992," shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subsections (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, as applicable: 
1.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
i.  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
ii.  The operator's per channel charge for basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
3.  If: 
i.  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
ii.  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channel offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or 180 days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after 180 days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(F)) 
Sec. 46-87. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope. The equipment regulated under this article consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation and additional connections separate from rates for basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 46-88. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge (HSC) methodology. The hourly service charge shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The hourly service charge is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC =  EB - CE / H 
Where, 
EB = annual equipment basket cost; CE = annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and H = person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year.  
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The hourly service charge multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The hourly service charge multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following formula: 
Monthly Charge =  UCE + (HSC × HR) 
12  
Where, 
HR = average hours repair per year; UCE = average annual unit cost of remote.  
Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in subsections (e), (f) and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customer's premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the hourly service charge times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under subsections (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this article. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(G)) 
Sec. 46-88. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment, installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment, any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing basic service tier and equipment, and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. 
(h)  Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(H)) 
Sec. 46-89. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(I)) 
Sec. 46-90. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer change in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the hourly service charge, as defined in section 46-86, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing similar customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times in a 12-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any 12-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(J)) 
Sec. 46-91. - Notification of proposed rate increase. 
(a)  A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is effective. The notice shall include a provision stating that protests to such prices may be filed with the city at the office of the city manager, located at 3200 Diana Drive, Richland Hills, Texas 76118. The notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the city no later than 30 days after the notice is received by the subscriber. 
(b)  In addition to the notice required in subsection (a) of this section, the cable operator shall give the city a minimum of 30 days advance written notification of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(K)) 
Sec. 46-92. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
    A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15, 1993, whichever is later. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(L)) 
Sec. 46-93. - City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city. Provided, however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (d) of this section within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 46-94 will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the city manager and must be received prior to the end of the 30-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in sections 46-86 and 46-87, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to sections 46-88 and 46-95, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in sections 46-86 and 46-87, the city may toll the 30-day deadline in subsection (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this section, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or orally during at least one city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in subsection (d) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the 90-day or 150-day period, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. Provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90-day or 150-day period permitted in subsection (d) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(M)) 
Sec. 46-94. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this article, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  Provided, however, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq., the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(N)) 
Sec. 46-95. - Burden of proof. 
(a)  A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 USC 543, and sections 46-86 and 46-87. 
(b)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier or associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost of equipment as set forth in sections 46-86 and 46-87, the cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form to the city. 
(c)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier that exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in sections 46-86 and 46-87, the cable operator must submit to the city a cost-of-service showing to justify the proposed rates. The cost-of-service showing must be in conformance with accounting and cost allocation requirements as adopted and amended by the commission for cable system operators. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(O)) 
Sec. 46-96. - Small systems. 
(a)  A small system, as defined in section 46-82, may certify that the small system's initial rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with section 46-86. A certification by a small system under this article shall be filed with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. The certification shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system and shall be verified. 
(b)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber. The city may request additional information from the operator in order to verify the certification. In the event proprietary information is requested by the city, the provisions of section 46-94 shall control the availability of such information to the public. 
(c)  As used in this section, "initial rates" shall mean those rates charged by the small system operator on the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that: 
(1)  The city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and 
(2)  This section has been adopted by the city. 
(d)  If the city determines that the small system's certification is in error, it shall so notify the small system operator and shall require the small system to comply with all filing requirements for nonsmall systems in this article. 
(e)  Subsequent rate filings by a small system operator shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this section. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(P)) 
Sec. 46-97. - Written decision. 
(a)  The city shall issue a written decision in a ratemaking proceeding whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part or approves a request for an increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested parties. The city is not required to issue a written decision that approves an unopposed existing or proposed rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment. 
(b)  Public notice shall be given of any written decision required in subsection (a) of this section by making the text of any written decision available to the public and by publication of the decision one time in the official newspaper of the city. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(Q)) 
Sec. 46-98. - Reduction of rates; prescription of rates. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to implement a prospective reduction in basic service tier or associated equipment rates where necessary to bring rates into compliance with the standards set forth in sections 46-86 and 46-87. 
(b)  The city may prescribe a reasonable rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment after it determines that a proposed rate is unreasonable. 
(Code 1984, ch. 4, § 12(R)) 
Sec. 46-99. - Refunds. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city shall give the operator notice and opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed refunds may be at any meeting of the city council during the city's period of review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period under section 46-93, and has issued an accounting order under subsection 46-93(e), then the operator, prior to refunds being ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to comment upon the proposed refunds. 
(b)  An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as it complies with such order. 
(c)  The refund period shall run as follows: 
(1)  From the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter. 
(2)  From the date the city issues an accounting order pursuant to subsection 46-93(e), and ending on the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the city or one year, whichever is shorter. 
(d)  The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in the following manner: 
(1)  By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or 
(2)  By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable system. 
(e)  Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments.

ARTICLE V. - RESTRICTIONS ON RESIDENCY OF SEXUAL OFFENDERS AGAINST CHILDREN 

Sec. 58-121. - Finding, intent and definitions. 
(a)  Findings and intent . That repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders that use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses and most sexual offenders commit many offences, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences.

(3)  Premises where children commonly gather . Public parks, private and public schools, amusement arcades, video arcades, indoor and outdoor amusement centers, amusement parks, public, commercial and semi-private swimming pools, and child day care centers, as such terms are defined in the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of the City of Richland Hills. For purposes of this article, planted street medians are not public parks 
(4)  Temporary residence . Either a place where a person abides, lodges or resides for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent residence, or a place where a person routinely abides, resides or lodges for a period of four or more consecutive or non-consecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence.

d.  No person or group is arbitrarily denied the use of the sight lines from the public right-of-way for communication purposes.

(3)  Landscape quality and preservation. To protect the public welfare and to enhance the appearance and economic value of the landscape, by providing that signs do not:

(d)  If a proposed abandonment affects a public street, the application shall be reviewed by the city engineer (if applicable) who shall determine that the application is technically correct and that the proposed abandonment does not adversely affect the public safety. If the application is approved by the city engineer, the engineer shall endorse such approval thereon, or if disapproved, the engineer shall clearly state the reasons for such disapproval on the face of the application. 
(e)  The application for abandonment shall be reviewed by the fire chief for determination of the effect of the abandonment on access and fire safety. The fire chief shall endorse such determination on the face of the application.

(k)  Upon completion of review by city staff, and in the event the request receives preliminary approval by the city council, the applicant shall be notified of the staff recommendations and preliminary action by the planning and zoning commission and the city council on such application. If the applicant still desires to pursue the abandonment request, the applicant shall submit a plat prepared by a registered professional surveyor describing by metes and bounds legal description of the street or easement to be abandoned. The plat shall depict the adjacent land and streets affected by the requested abandonment. Upon such submission, such application and plat shall again be reviewed by the city. If the city review of the plat indicates that significant changes might exist, then the city shall initiate a review of such plat by the city engineer (if applicable), fire chief, police chief and public works director under the criteria listed above, and if any of such officials' determinations are changed by such re-review, such change shall be noted on the face of such application. The application, plat and accompanying material shall again be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for review and recommendation and, after such consideration, shall be placed on a city council agenda for final consideration. 
(l)  The city council may elect to waive the requirements and procedures of this division and abandon any easement or portion thereof to a property owner upon the request of said property owner by resolution, provided such resolution is passed by at least a four-fifths vote.

(b)  Any provider, except a certificated telecommunications provider, prior to placing, reconstructing, or altering facilities in, on, under or over the public rights-of-way, must obtain separate municipal authorization from the city. 
(c)  Any provider with a current, unexpired consent, franchise, agreement or other authorization from the city (grant) to use the public rights-of-way that is in effect at the time this article takes effect shall continue to operate under and comply with that grant until the grant expires or until it is terminated by mutual agreement of the city and the provider, or is terminated as otherwise provided for in such grant or by applicable law. So long as such grant is in effect, it shall control and this article shall not be applicable in the event of a conflict. 
(d)  In order for the city to know which providers own facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city, each such provider that owns facilities shall register with the city and provide the information required by the city, on forms provided by or approved by the city. Each provider shall update and keep current its registration with the city at all times. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 4, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-255. - Administration and enforcement.

(Ord. No. 876-00, § 5, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-256. - Construction obligations. 
    A provider is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property, based upon the city's historic rights under state and federal laws. Such regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  At the city's request, a provider shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance and repair of facilities performed by the provider in the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A provider may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way overhead or underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable, feasible or is not equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(3)  A provider shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public rights-of-way. The city may waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the provider. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A provider shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(4)  A provider must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by this article and any other applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the provider's facilities. A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance that does not require excavation of the public rights-of-way or which does not block traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods between 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays, or for more than two hours during any nonpeak traffic period. Once a permit is issued, the provider shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above-listed activities on its facilities in, on, over or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the provider to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above-listed activities in, on, under or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (11) of this section, will subject the provider to a stop work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to this Code. If the provider fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, or within a specific period stated in such permit, the permit shall become invalid, and the provider will be required to obtain another permit. 
(5)  When a provider completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the provider shall promptly restore the public rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance or repair of the provider's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work, unless extended by the city for good cause. 
(6)  Upon failure of a provider to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the provider, and in the event repairs have not been initiated during such five-day period, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the provider, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the provider will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(7)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a provider shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided in this article. 
(8)  Notwithstanding the foregoing in subsection (7), if the city determines that the failure of a provider to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has been provided, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances. A provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(9)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least five business days before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(10)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a provider shall remove or abate the provider's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The provider and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the provider, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the provider, without paying compensation to the provider and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(11)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or persons (emergency conditions), a provider may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager or designee shall be notified as promptly as possible regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the provider shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(12)  Within 60 days of completion of each new permitted section of a provider's facilities, the provider shall supply the city with a complete set of as-built drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of the provider's business to the extent they are prepared in the ordinary course of business, but excluding customer specific, proprietary or confidential information and as reasonably prescribed by the city and as allowed by law. The city may, at its discretion, accept in lieu of as-built drawings, any reasonable alternative which provides adequate information as to the location of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(13)  The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a provider, as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(14)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager or his designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the provider or providers to an unreasonable increase in risk of service interruption, or to an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 6, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-257. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a provider, and to change the curb, sidewalks or the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent the city can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If the city authorizes landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized user of the public rights-of-way. If the city closes or abandons a public right-of-way that contains a portion of a provider's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public right-of-way subject to the rights of the provider. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, a provider shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of provider's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the provider. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with the provider before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a provider's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the provider. 
(e)  If the provider fails to relocate facilities within the time allowed by the city in this section, the provider may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in this Code, now or hereafter enacted. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything in subsection (d) of this section, the city manager and a provider may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(g)  A provider may trim trees in or over the public rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its facilities. All tree trimmings shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the provider, its contractor or agent fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. 
(h)  Providers shall temporarily remove, raise or lower their aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures if the city gives written notice of not less than 48 hours. The expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefitting from the temporary rearrangements. The provider may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary move. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 7, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-258. - Insurance requirements. 
(a)  A provider shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in the state acceptable to the city. A provider shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of the request for construction permits. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state or letters written by the provider in those instances where the state does not issue such certificates, which provide the same coverage as required in this section. However, for the city to accept such letters, the provider must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. The city's current insurance requirements are described in exhibit A printed at the end of this article. 
(b)  A provider shall furnish to the city, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the provider or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name of the city and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage; 
(2)  Provide for 30 days prior, written notice to the city for cancellation, nonrenewal or material change; and 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail. 
(d)  A provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. A provider shall immediately advise the city attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the provider and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause entitled "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 8, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-259. - Indemnity. 
(a)  Except as to certificated telecommunications providers, each provider placing facilities in the public rights-of-way shall, as a condition of permit approval, agree to promptly defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses or expenses (i) for the repair, replacement or restoration of city's property, equipment, materials, structures and facilities which are damaged, destroyed or found to be defective as a result of the provider's acts or omissions, (ii) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action and judgments for (a) damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but not limited to the provider, its agents, officers, employees and subcontractors, city's agents, officers and employees, and third parties); and/or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of income or wages to any person (including, but not limited to the agents, officers and employees of the provider, the provider's subcontractors and the city, and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from the negligent or willful act or omissions of the provider, its agents, employees and/or subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the provider has a franchise agreement effective within the city, and such franchise agreement includes indemnity provisions in favor of the city, then to the extent of any conflict between the foregoing and the indemnity provisions in the franchise, the provisions in the franchise shall be controlling. 
(b)  This indemnity provision shall not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors. 
(c)  The provisions of this indemnity are solely for the benefit of the city and are not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 9, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-260. - Revocation or denial of permits. 
    If any of the provisions of this article or of a permit granted under this article are violated or otherwise not followed, a permit may be revoked by the city manager or his designee. If a provider has not followed the terms of this article or of a prior permit issued under this article in work done pursuant to a prior permit, new permits may be denied or additional terms imposed. Failure to reimburse the city as required in this article shall, in addition to all other remedies available to the city, be grounds for recovery by the city upon the surety bonds required in this article or by any permit issued under this article for the amounts which should have been reimbursed, together with all costs incurred by the city in recovering such sums, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Any appeal from the denial or revocation of a permit shall be to the city council, and shall be filed with the city manager within 15 days of the action appealed from. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 10, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-261. - Governing law. 
    This article shall be construed in accordance with the city codes in effect on the date of passage of this article to the extent that such codes are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Texas, subject to the city's ongoing authority to adopt reasonable regulations to manage its public rights-of-way, pursuant to sections 70-256 and 70-257 or as otherwise provided by law. 
(Ord. No. 876-00, § 11, 5-9-2000) 
Sec. 70-262. - Unauthorized use of public rights-of-way. 
    The city may institute all appropriate legal action to prohibit any provider from knowingly using the public rights-of-way unless the provider has complied with the terms of this article.

_____
2.  The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements during the effective period of any franchise or municipal consent agreement, and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state or letters written by the applicant in those instances where the state does not issue such certificates, which provide the same coverage required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters, the applicant must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. 
3.  Each policy must include a cancellation provision in which the insurance company is required to notify the city in writing, not fewer than 30 days before cancelling, failing to renew or reducing policy limits. Each policy shall provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail. 
4.  The applicant shall file the required original certificate of insurance prior to any commencement of work. The certificate shall state the policy number; name of insurance company; name and address of the agent or authorized representative of the insurance company; name, address and telephone number of insured; policy expiration and specific coverage amounts. The certificate shall name the city and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insured for all applicable coverage. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions unless the policy provisions are established by law or regulation binding the city, the applicant or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, the applicant shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
5.  Applicant shall obtain and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and file with the community development department, a corporate surety bond in the amount of $100,000.00 both to guarantee timely construction and faithful adherence to all requirements of the public right-of-way management ordinance, and any permit issued thereunder. In the discretion of the city manager, the bond amount may be reduced to $50,000.00 after a period of two years provided applicant has complied with all terms and conditions herein. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be cancelled by the surety nor any intention not to renew be exercised by the surety until 30 days after receipt by the city of such written notice of such intent." The bond shall provide, but not be limited to, the following condition: "There shall be recoverable by the city, jointly and severally from the principal and the surety, any and all damages, losses or costs suffered by the city resulting from the failure of the applicant to satisfactorily construct facilities or to adhere to all the requirements of the public right-of-way management ordinance." The rights reserved to the city with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by public right-of-way management ordinance or authorized by law; and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to such bond shall affect any other rights the city may have. 
6.  The city manager or his designee may waive or reduce the above requirements, taking into consideration both that the applicant has furnished the city with reasonable documentation to evidence adequate financial resources substantially greater than the insurance and bonding requirements, and has demonstrated in prior rights-of-way construction activity, prompt resolution of any claims and substantial compliance with all required applicable codes and ordinances. 
7.  The financial and insurance requirements may be met by applicants with a current franchise or license and applicants governed by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 283.001 et seq. if the current franchise, license or statutory indemnity adequately provides for insurance or bonds or provides an adequately indemnity in favor of the city.

(1)  That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land; 
(2)  That strict application of the provisions of this chapter is not necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare; 
(3)  That the granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area;

Such findings of the city council, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the council meeting at which such waiver is granted. Waivers may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute unnecessary hardship; and 
(5)  That the granting of the waiver will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of this chapter. The planning and zoning commission, in the recommendation of a waiver to the city council, shall submit all the specific facts and pertinent data upon which such a waiver has been recommended. Any waiver granted by the city council, after considering the material submitted by the planning and zoning commission, shall be final. 
(c)  The city council finds it necessary to grant a waiver pursuant to article IV.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 74-151. - Improvements required. 
(a)  The subdivider shall furnish, install and/or construct the water and sewerage systems and the street and drainage facilities necessary for the proper development of the subdivision. All such facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the design provisions contained in this chapter, and other standards, specifications, and drawings as may be adopted by the city council. 
(b)  Where shown on the master plan, or considered necessary by the city council in order to protect the public health, safety or welfare, public facilities shall be sized in excess of that dictated by the design criteria to provide for future growth and expansion. The city council shall establish policies whereby the city will participate in the construction of such oversized facilities or reimburse the subdivider for the costs of such oversized facilities. 
(c)  Land proposed to be subdivided must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including water and wastewater facilities, roadway and pedestrian facilities, drainage facilities and park facilities. An application for a plat or development may be denied unless adequate public facilities necessary to support and serve the development exist or provision has been made for the facilities, whether the facilities are to be located within the property being platted or offsite. 
(d)  It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for public works improvements to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process. 
(e)  The city desires to assure both that impacts of new development are mitigated through contributions of rights-of-way, easements and construction of capital improvements, and that a new development be required to contribute not more than its proportionate share of such costs. 
(f)  Proposed public works improvements serving new development shall conform to and be properly related to the public facilities elements of the city=s adopted master plan, other adopted master plans for public facilities and services, and applicable capital improvements plans, and shall meet the service levels specified in such plans. 
(Ord. No. 819-97, § 1(I), 6-10-1997; Ord. No. 1063-06, § 12, 8-22-2006) 
Sec. 74-152. - Intent; waivers; adoption of standards. 
(a)  The standards established in this ordinance for dedication and construction of public works improvements and infrastructure are based upon engineering studies and historical usages and demands by different categories of development. These regulations identify certain minimum requirements and sizes for utilities, roadways, parks and other facilities that the city council has determined to be necessary in order to provide the minimum level of service necessary to protect or promote the public health, safety, and welfare and to assure the quality of life currently enjoyed by the citizens of Richland Hills. It is the intent of these regulations that no development occur until and unless these minimum levels of service are met. Therefore, each subdivision in the city shall be required to dedicate, construct and/or upgrade required facilities and infrastructure to a capacity that meets these minimum levels. 
(b)  For each category of public infrastructure, a minimum standard of infrastructure, and in some cases, service level, has been developed based upon historic studies and construction projects of the city and other cities. These minimum standards take into consideration the soil conditions and topographic configuration of the city, the use and impact analyses of the North Central Texas council of Governments in developing standard specifications for public works installation, and other historical use and performance experiences of the city that reflect the minimum level of facilities and services that must be built to meet the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Richland Hills. 
(c)  In order to maintain prescribed levels of public facilities and services for the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, the city may require the dedication of easements and rights-of-way for or construction of on-site or off-site public works improvements for water, wastewater, road, drainage or park facilities to serve a proposed subdivision, or require the payment of fees in lieu thereof. If adequate levels of public facilities and services cannot be provided concurrent with the schedule of development proposed, the city may deny the subdivision until the public facilities and services can be provided, or require that the development be phased so that the availability and delivery of facilities and services coincides with the demands for the facilities created by the development. 
(d)  Whenever the city council determines that levels of service in excess of these minimum standards are necessary in order to promote the orderly development of the city, the owner shall qualify for reimbursement for any costs in excess of the minimum levels of service through city participation, to the extent funds are available by a pro rata reimbursement policy or other means adopted by the city. 
(e)  The city council may grant a waiver in accordance with section 74-4 where specific topographic or other conditions make a waiver from these standards necessary in order to achieve the best overall design. 
(f)  There is hereby adopted by reference and made a part of this chapter design standards and specifications which shall control the design, construction and installation of street paving, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, utilities and other public improvements required in this chapter. All references to city design standards and specifications shall mean and include those standards and specifications, together with all exhibits, charts, drawings and diagrams appertaining thereto, which have been approved by the officials having jurisdiction and placed on file in the offices of such officials. Provisions not stated in this chapter will be regulated by the North Central Texas Council of Government Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.

Sec. 74-153. - Land unsuitable for subdivision. 
    Any land which, in its natural state, is subject to a 100-year flood or which cannot be properly drained shall not be subdivided, resubdivided or developed until receipt of evidence that the construction of specific improvements proposed by the subdivider can be expected to yield a usable building site. Thereafter the planning and zoning commission and city council may approve plats. However, construction upon such land shall be prohibited until the specific improvements have been planned and construction guaranteed. 
(Ord. No. 819-97, § 11(G), 6-10-1997) 
Sec. 74-154. - Recreation and public lands. 
    Providing adequate sites for recreation, parks, open space, school sites, and other community facilities is a public necessity in an urban area. The acquisition and improvement of these sites in step with private development of the area served by them is of mutual benefit to the subdivider and to the public. Therefore when advised during the preapplication conference that the parks and recreation open space master plan and/or comprehensive land use plan shows a need for such facilities either partially or totally within the proposed development area, the subdivider shall include in his preliminary plat design sites for such purposes. 
(Ord. No. 819-97, § 11(H), 6-10-1997) 
Sec. 74-155. - Unified residential development; planned unit development. 
(a)  All proposed unified residential developments, also referred to as planned unit developments, shall comply with the provisions relating thereto and contained within the comprehensive zoning ordinance. All streets not dedicated to the public shall be paved to street design standards adopted by the city and shall be maintained by means of a homeowner's association, or other means as approved by the city council. 
(b)  Any request to dedicate a private street as a public street shall be approved only if arrangements are made to bring the street into conformity with all city standards and regulations in effect at the time of dedication at the cost of affected property owners. 
(c)  All private streets that intersect with public streets shall be constructed with standard drive type approaches. In such cases where an unusual condition exists, the city engineer may approve standard intersection approaches if the approval is requested prior to the preparation of the plans. Private streets will be named and shown on the plat. Private streets shall be indicated as such on the plat. Street signs for such private streets shall be erected and maintained by the homeowner's association.

The city may require the phasing of development and/or improvements in order to maintain adequate water capacity. 
(b)  All lots to be platted shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The city engineer shall be responsible for determining the approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The city may require the phasing of development and/or improvements in order to maintain adequate wastewater capacity. 
(c)  Proposed roads shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation and shall be properly related to the applicable thoroughfare plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each proposed subdivision or development. New subdivisions shall be supported by a thoroughfare network having adequate capacity, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. Each development shall have adequate access to the thoroughfare network. 
(d)  Drainage improvements serving new development shall be designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. The city may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or detention, the construction of off-site drainage improvements, or drainage impact fees in order to mitigate the impacts of the proposed subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 1063-06, § 14, 8-22-2006) 
Sec. 74-157. - Timing of dedication and construction. 
(a)  The city shall require an initial demonstration that a proposed subdivision shall be adequately served by public facilities and services at the time for approval of the first development application that portrays a specific plan of development, including but not limited to a petition for establishing a planned development zoning district, or other overlay zoning district; or a developer's agreement; or an application for a preliminary or final plat. 
(b)  The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct one or more public works improvements to serve a new subdivision may be deferred until approval of a subsequent phase of the subdivision, at the sole discretion of the city engineer, upon written request of the property owner, or at the city's own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the city may require that the subdivider include provisions in the developer's agreement, specifying the time for dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of public works improvements serving the subdivision.

Sec. 74-196. - FIRM identified flood hazard areas. 
(a)  Drainage easements shall be provided along the top of the bank of natural drainageways, lakes or reservoirs. Such drainage easements shall encompass all areas within the natural drainageways, lakes or reservoirs, plus such additional width, 15 feet minimum, extended above and beyond the top of bank or as may be required to provide ingress and egress to allow maintenance of the banks and for the protection of adjacent property, as determined and required by the city engineer. 
(b)  The following full statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument of the subdivision plat: 
Floodway Restriction Statement: 
The developer's engineer will be required to submit a report to the "Federal Emergency Management Agency" for any development that alters a floodway. Development shall not begin within a floodway without an approved plan by FEMA. 
No construction, without the written approval of the city shall be allowed within an identified "FIRM" floodplain area, and then only after detailed floodplain development permit including engineering plans and studies show that no rise in the base flood elevation (BFE) will result, that no flooding will result, that no obstruction to the natural flow of water will result; and subject to all owners of the property affected by such construction becoming a party to the request. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood elevation. 
The existing creeks, lakes, reservoirs, or drainage channel traversing along or across portions of this addition, will remain open at all times and will be maintained by the individual owners of the lot or lots that are traversed by or adjacent to the drainage courses along or across such lots. The city will not be responsible for the maintenance and operation of such drainageways or for the control of erosion. 
Each property owner shall keep the natural drainage channels traversing or adjacent to his property clean and free of debris, silt, or any substance which would result in unsanitary conditions and the city shall have the right of ingress and egress for the purpose of inspection and supervision of maintenance work by the property owner to alleviate any undesirable conditions which may occur. The natural drainage channel, as in the case of all natural drainage channels, are subject to storm water overflow and natural bank erosion to an extent that cannot be definitely defined. The city shall not be liable for damages of any nature resulting from the occurrence of these natural phenomena, nor resulting from a failure of any structure within the natural drainage channels. The natural drainage channel crossing each lot is shown by the floodway easement line as shown on the plat.

Sec. 74-290. - Generally. 
(a)  Prior to a decision by the planning and zoning commission or city official on an application for plat approval or any other application for which an exaction requirement is approved as a condition of approval, the city engineer shall prepare a written statement affirming that each exaction requirement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval or permit approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the subdivision or development on the applicable public facilities system of the city, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed. In making this determination, the city engineer may consider: 
(1)  Categorical findings and recommendations of the North Central Texas Council of Governments in developing standard specifications for public infrastructure improvements and stormwater management; 
(2)  The proposed and potential use of the land; 
(3)  The timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities systems; 
(4)  Impact fee studies, traffic impact studies both geometric and capacity oriented, drainage studies or other studies, fire protection, consumption and irrigation water needs, liquid water collecting disposal or standards that measure the demand for services created by developments and the impact on the city's public facilities system; 
(5)  The level of service and functionality of both on-site and off-site of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed subdivision or development; 
(6)  The degree to which public infrastructure improvements necessary to serve the proposed subdivision are supplied by other developments; 
(7)  The anticipated participation by the city in the costs of necessary public infrastructure improvements; 
(8)  The degree to which acceptable private infrastructure improvements to be constructed and maintained by the applicant will offset the need for public infrastructure improvements; 
(9)  Any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed subdivision is eligible; and/or 
(10)  Any other information relating to the impacts created by the proposed subdivision or development on the city's public facilities systems. 
(b)  Based upon the proportionality determination, the city engineer shall affirm that the exaction requirements of this article or other ordinance requiring the permit, as applied to the proposed subdivision or development, do not impose costs on the applicant for public infrastructure improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed subdivision or development. 
(c)  The city engineer may require that the applicant, at its expense, submit any information or studies that may assist in making the proportionality determination.

(e)  If a photographic traffic signal enforcement system is to be installed at an intersection on or after January 1, 2008, then, in addition to the requirements of subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, the city shall also compile a written report of the number and type of traffic accidents that have occurred at such intersection for a period of at least 18 months prior to the date of the report. The city shall provide a copy of this report to the Texas Department of Transportation within six months of the date the photographic traffic signal enforcement system is installed at the intersection approach. 
(f)  Beginning on and after January 1, 2008, the city shall monitor and report annually in writing to the Texas Department of Transportation on the form prescribed by such department concerning the number and type of traffic accidents that occur at all system locations to determine whether the installation of the system results in a reduction in accidents or a reduction in the severity of accidents at those locations. 
(g)  In addition to installing the photographic traffic signal enforcement system, the city shall also install signs along each roadway that leads to the intersection at which such system is installed. The signs must be at least 100 feet from the intersection or located according to the standards established in the manual adopted by the Texas Transportation Commission under V.T.C.A., Transportation Code § 544.001. In addition, the signs must be easily readable to any motor vehicle operator approaching the intersection and must clearly indicate the presence of a photographic monitoring system that records violations that may result in the issuance of a notice of violation and the imposition of a monetary penalty.

DIVISION 3. - SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 86-66. - Sanitary sewer service line maintenance policy. 
(a)  Responsibility. 
(1)  It is the city's responsibility to clean, repair or replace all portions of city-owned main lines laid within the limits of a dedicated street right-of-way or utility easement. 
(2)  It is the customer's responsibility to maintain all portions of their service line up to the main line including the tap at the city's main. The service line may be located on private property as well as on dedicated streets or easements. In the event that the customer's service line located under the paved portion of a dedicated street needs repair/replacement, that portion of the defective service line shall be replaced at the expense of the city. The city shall assume service line responsibility for the necessary repair/replacement of only that portion of service line that lies beneath the limits of a paved street. 
(3)  If the customer's service line does not pass under a paved dedicated street, the city is responsible for the city main only. The city main is the city-owned sewer line laid within the limits of a dedicated street right-of-way or dedicated utility easement. The service line is the sewer line that connects the customer's establishment to the city main including the tap. 
(b)  Procedure for sewer complaints. 
(1)  When a sewer complaint is received, a water utilities division maintenance crew will be dispatched as soon as possible to the scene. The customer involved will be advised not to introduce additional sewage into the service line, if possible. The customer may call a plumber if they so desire. 
(2)  The city's main will be inspected and cleaned, if necessary. After cleaning the city main, the customer will be advised that the city main is flowing free. If city crews determine that the city's line is free and blockage exists in the customer's service line, the customer shall be advised to obtain the service of a plumber to clear, repair or replace his service line. 
(3)  If the customer's plumber is unable to clear the service line under a paved street, the following procedure will be followed: 
a.  The customer and/or his plumber will locate and expose the service line behind the curb on the customer's side of the street, except when a four-inch or larger cleanout exists. 
b.  Upon notification that the service line is exposed or accessible by camera, water utilities division maintenance crews will evaluate that portion of the service line under the paved street. The owner and/or plumber must be present while the maintenance crew works on their service line. 
c.  Upon investigation, if the water utilities division maintenance crew finds the service line under the paved street to be in good working condition, the property owner will be billed for services rendered by the water utilities division. 
d.  The water utilities division will televise the service line in order to justify service line repair or replacement at the expense of the city. (Applies only to that portion beneath city street.) 
e.  The city's responsibility for taps located at the rear of the property in the utility easement is limited to that described in subsection (b)(2) of this section.

Sec. 86-89. - Special rules relating to industrial dischargers. 
(a)  Compliance with standards. 
(1)  Applicable laws. All dischargers shall be subject to those federal, state, and local requirements and limitations which are the most stringent. 
(2)  Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this subdivision. 
(3)  Mass limitations. Where deemed appropriate the authority may apply mass limitation expressed in pounds per day of pollutant discharged. 
(4)  Categorical pretreatment standards. 
a.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
b.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
c.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
d.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.25. 
(b)  Accidental discharge. 
(1)  Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this subdivision. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. When applicable, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the authority for review, and shall be approved by the authority before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this subdivision. 
(2)  Dischargers shall notify the authority immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug" or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this subdivision. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, corrective actions taken, and be signed by the dischargers authorized representative. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit to the director a detailed written report which specifies: A description and cause of the discharge, including location of the discharge, type, concentration, and volume of water; duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times of noncompliance and, if the noncompliance is continuing, an immediate response to cause the noncompliant discharge to cease; and all steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent continuation or recurrence of such an upset, slug load, or accidental discharge, spill, or other conditions of noncompliance. Any discharger discharging slugs of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater system and the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the authority under state or federal law. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection. Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with respect to emergency notification procedure including the proper telephone number of the authority to be notified. 
(c)  Wastewater discharges into private sewer systems. All dischargers who discharge wastewater into a private sewer system shall comply with this subdivision including section 86-90; provided, however, that flow measurement may be based on metered water consumption. Each discharger shall provide an agreement, signed by the owner of the sewer system, which authorizes the authority's personnel to enter onto the owner's property for purposes of inspection and monitoring of discharger's premises, and for enforcement pursuant to the term of this subdivision. 
(d)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass of a discharger's treatment equipment or treatment facility is prohibited and the authority may take enforcement action against the discharger unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastewater, or maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if, in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment, adequate back-up equipment should have been installed to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance; and 
c.  The discharger submitted advanced, written notice of the need for a bypass. 
(2)  The discharger shall submit oral notice to the authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds categorical standards or other discharge limits within 24 hours of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. Written notice shall be provided within five days of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. The written notice shall include a description of the bypass and its causes, duration of the bypass, steps taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the bypass, and must be signed by the authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  The authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if it determines that the bypass will meet all of the conditions of subsection (a). 
(e)  Notification of hazardous waste discharges. All dischargers shall notify the authority, the control authority, the EPA's Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the approval authority in writing of any discharge into a wastewater system or POTW of any substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Any notification under this subsection must be submitted in conformance with 40 CFR Part 403.12(p). 
(Ord. No. 1225-12, § 1(exh. A), 12-13-2011)

(2)  All significant industrial users shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application to the authority on a form provided by the authority at least 90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. Nonsignificant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) and nonsignificant industrial users (NSIU) shall be required to submit applications at dates specified by the director. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit, who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW, shall obtain such permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. The application shall contain: 
a.  All information required by subsection (c). 
b.  Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemical used or stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged into the POTW; 
c.  Number and type of employee, hours of operation, and proposed or actual hours of operation; 
d.  Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and rate of production;

All group II, III and IV dischargers shall submit an industrial waste questionnaire. The questionnaire will be reviewed by the public works utility superintendent or authorized representative. If deemed necessary, group II, III or IV dischargers may also be required to obtain a permit as outlined herein. 
(3)  No new group I, group IV, group V or group VI user shall be allowed to discharge until issued a valid permit. 
(4)  The authority will evaluate the completed applications and data furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. If, after evaluation, the application is deemed satisfactory, then a wastewater discharge permit shall be issued within 60 days after the evaluation is complete. The wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified herein and to the regulations of the authority. 
(5)  If the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing within 30 days of the reasons for such denial. If denial is based on the authority's determination that the applicant cannot meet the wastewater discharge limitations of this subdivision, the authority may specify that the applicant be required to provide pretreatment of the waste before it is deemed acceptable for sewer discharge. 
(6)  Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this subdivision, pursuant to subsection (a)(5) above, the discharger shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implement added operational and maintenance activities. 
a.  The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this subdivision including, but not limited to dates, relating to hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract(s) for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this subdivision. 
b.  The time increments established between milestone dates shall be the shortest practicable for the completion of the required work.

c.  Not later than 14 days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a progress report to the authority, including a statement as to whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the authority. 
(7)  Prior to the approval of a permit, unless exempted by the authority, all dischargers shall provide monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and/or flow measurement of wastewaters before entering the sanitary sewer of the authority. Each monitoring facility shall be located on the discharger's premises; provided, however, where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the discharger, the authority may approve the placement of monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. All monitoring equipment and facilities shall be maintained in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. Failure to provide proper monitoring facilities shall be grounds for denial of a permit. 
(b)  Permit conditions. Permits are issued to a specific discharger for specific operation and are not assignable to another discharger or transferable to any other location without the prior written approval of the authority.

(c)  Reporting requirements for dischargers. 
(1)  Baseline report. Within 180 days following the effective date for new or revised categorical pretreatment standards, or at least 90 days prior to commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the authority a report (in a form provided by the authority), indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The report shall also contain: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of nature, average rate of production, standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The result of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in this section. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (c)(4) herein. 
4.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. However, the city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. Historical data that can represent the current discharge only can be accepted as a baseline report. 
5.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment, best management practices and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this subdivision must meet the requirements set out in this section. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports shall be signed by an authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional as stated in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(6). 
(2)  90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements, including BMPs. This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  Periodic compliance reports. 
a.  Any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard made a part of this subdivision shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards hereof. Reports are required after the compliance date of such a pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge, and are to be submitted at least once every six months (on dates specified by the authority). In addition, where applicable, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in section 86-90. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided, however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. 
b.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user, and contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices. 
c.  All nonsignificant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements and data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
d.  If the director has determined that needs a permit, then the NSIU shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
e.  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 86-90(c)(9) of this article. 
f.  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring equipment in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
g.  Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
h.  The authority, taking into consideration extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
(4)  Analysis and sampling procedures. 
a.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques with chain-of-custodies, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or any other reports shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator of the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by EPA. Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
b.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in subsection (c)(4)b.2. below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
3.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. 
4.  For the reports required by paragraphs (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(5)  Reporting additional monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsections (c)(4) and (b)(2), the results of this monitoring along with chain-of-custody forms shall be included in the report. 
(6)  Significant noncategorical industrial user reporting. Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the authority at least once every six months (on dates as specified by the authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in subsection (c)(4). This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. 
(7)  Notification of changed discharge. Dischargers shall give prior written notification to the authority and City of Fort Worth of any potential and actual significant changes in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge, and any changes at its facility that affect the potential for a slug discharge. 
a.  The notification to the authority shall be received at least 90 days prior to change. 
b.  The authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
c.  The authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
d.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, and the deletion of any pollutant regulated by this subdivision or a permit issued pursuant to this subdivision. 
(8)  Authority monitoring. Sampling and analysis for the reports required by subsections (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) above, may be performed by the authority in lieu of the discharger. If all information required for the report, including flow data, is collected by the authority, the discharger will be required to submit the report or certifications. 
(9)  Signatory requirements. 
a.  All applications and compliance reports submitted to the authority must contain the following certification statement and be signed by the authorized representative: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information and for not reporting known violations, including possibility of fine and imprisonment." 
b.  Annual certification for nonsignificant categorical industrial users. A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial user by the director pursuant to section 86-86 and subsection 86-90(a)(1)f.; must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in 40 CFR 403.120(I). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the director: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR _____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from __________,__________ to _________, _________ [months, days, year]: 
(a)  The facility described as _________ [facility name] met the definition of a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as described in section 86-86 and subsection 86-90(a)(1)f.; 
(b)  The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
(c)  The facility never discharged categorical process wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. 
This compliance certification is based on the following information: 
_________________________________ 
________________________________ 
(10)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the authority, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The authority is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(d)  Inspection and flow measurement. 
(1)  Inspection. 
a.  The authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger (SIU, NSCIU or NSIU) at least once a year to determine compliance with the requirements of this subdivision. The director shall evaluate whether each SIU, needs a plan to control slug discharges at the time of SIU determination or at least by the first year. 
The discharger shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. All reports and records related to the provisions of this subdivision shall be made available for copying and inspection by the authority. The authority shall have the right to set upon the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and metering or measuring operations. User shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the city to perform independent monitoring activities. 
b.  The inspectors, agents or representatives of the authority charged with the enforcement of this subdivision shall be deemed to be performing a governmental function for the benefit and health and welfare of the general public and neither the authority, nor any individual inspector, agent or representative shall be held liable for any loss or damage, whether real or asserted, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of the performance of such governmental function. The failure or refusal of such owner or discharger to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the disconnection of water or sewer service to the facility. If entry is denied or if a person in control cannot be located, the director shall have every recourse provided by law to secure entry. Such recourse shall include the right to obtain a search warrant under the guidelines of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; and for the purposes of same, any person with enforcement authority under this chapter is hereby declared to be a "health officer." 
c.  Facilities regulated under this chapter are subject to the authority of the following agencies concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing federal and state pretreatment programs and other applicable law: (i) the EPA under section 308 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 3318), as amended; and (ii) the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) under V.T.C.A., Water Code §§ 26.014 and 26.015, as amended, and V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code §§ 361.032 and 361.037, as amended. 
d.  The industrial waste discharged or deposited into the sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the authority. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration the waste under operational conditions. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. The determination of the character and concentration of industrial waste shall be made at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the authority. Should a discharger desire a determination of the quality of such industrial waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the authority, such special determination may be made by the authority at the expense of the owner or discharger. 
e.  The authority shall conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The authority shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. The result of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(2)  NOV/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. Within 30 days submit to the director a report which addresses: 
a.  The time, date, location, processes, and operations associated with the violation, and the personnel assigned responsibility and/or present during the violation; 
b.  The cause or probable cause of the noncompliance; and 
c.  The actions taken and implemented to meet permit conditions. 
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
1.  The authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
2.  The authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(3)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing sewage charges shall be based upon metered water consumption or discharge as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city's water department. 
a.  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the metered water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the director may require or permit the installation of additional approved meters at the owner's expense, to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system. If approved by the director, the measured quantity of water actually entering the sewer system will be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
b.  Any discharger who procures all or part of its water supply from sources other than the city's water department, all or part of which is subsequently discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at its expense an effluent meter or flow measuring device approved by the director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
c.  If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, the quantity or quality of the waste shall be determined in any manner or method the director may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sanitary sewage system of the authority and/or the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
(e)  Permit modifications. 
(1)  The authority reserves the right to amend any permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the authority with applicable laws and regulations. The authority may amend any permit for good cause including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
b.  Material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit. 
c.  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge. 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the authority's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the receiving waters. 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit. 
f.  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting. 
g.  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit. 
h.  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator. 
i.  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws, or rules and regulations. 
j.  To incorporate, revise or revoke new or existing best management practices. 
(2)  All categorical pretreatment standards promulgated and adopted by the EPA after the effective date of this subdivision shall automatically become a part of this subdivision. Where a discharger, subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required by subsection 86-90(a)(2), the discharger shall apply for a permit from the authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard by the EPA. In addition, the discharger with an existing permit shall submit to the authority within 180 days after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the information required by subsection (c)(1) herein. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(f)  Confidential information. 
(1)  All information and data submitted by a discharger to the authority or POTW may be submitted to any state or federal agency governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure; provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2 as follows: 
a.  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedures set forth below. 
b.  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(2)  Asserting business confidentiality claim. A discharger which is submitting information to the authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on or attaching to the information, at the time it is submitted to the authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(3)  Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, and the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by the discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. Effluent data which cannot be held as confidential is as defined in 40 CFR 2.302. 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to any public disclosure requirements which may exist under the Texas Public Information Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 552, as amended. 
(g)  Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit re-issuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with subsection (a)(2) herein, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. No. 1225-12, § 1(exh. A), 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 86-91. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notice of violation. 
(1)  When a director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the director may issue to such person a written notice of violation. 
(2)  No later than the tenth day after receipt of the notice, the violator shall submit to the issuing director an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of a reoccurrence of the violation. Such plan shall include specific actions to be taken by the violator. 
(3)  If the violator denies that any violation occurred, or contends that no corrective action is necessary, he shall submit to the director no later than the tenth day after receipt of the notice, a written explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention. 
(4)  Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves a violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(5)  Issuance of a notice of violation shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a violator. 
(b)  Nonemergency termination of water supply and/or discharge. 
(1)  A user who violates the following conditions is subject to the termination of its city-provided water supply and/or its discharge: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; or 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents or characteristics prior to discharge; or 
d.  Allow reasonable access to the discharger's premises by representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
e.  Pay sewer charges; or

h.  Failure to meet effluent limitations; including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards; or 
i.  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(2)  a.  Whenever the authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies revocation of a permit, pursuant to subsection (a) above, the authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice, either by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. 
b.  Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond in person or in writing to the authority, advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. 
(3)  The user shall not recommence its discharge until the director so authorizes and: 
a.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the noncomplying discharge has ceased; 
b.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the conditions creating the threat of imminent and substantial danger have been eliminated; 
c.  The user pays the city for all costs the city will incur in reinstating services; 
d.  Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  Administrative orders. Where the violation of subsection (a), hereof is not corrected by means of enforcement action listed in subsection (b), the following enforcement escalations may be used. Terms may or may not be negotiated with industrial users: 
(1)  Consent order. An agreement between the authority and the industrial user normally containing three elements: (1) compliance schedules; (2) stipulated fines or remedial actions; and (3) signatures of the authority and authorized representatives. 
(2)  Show cause order. An order which directs the user to appear before the city to explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied. Typically used after informal contacts or NOV's have failed to resolve noncompliance; however, it can be used at anytime. 
(3)  Compliance order. An order which directs the industrial user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. Terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance. Typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair, or process changes, or to require development of management practices, spill prevention programs, and other pretreatment program requirements. 
(d)  Right of appeal of administrative ruling. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by this subdivision and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this subdivision or deals with a permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply; provided, however, the authority may take any action it deems necessary to protect its wastewater collection and treatment system or to comply with its TPDES permit or to comply with any contract the authority has for the treatment of wastewater. 
(e)  Judicial proceedings. The authority, with respect to the conduct of any discharger contrary to the provisions of this subdivision may authorize its attorney to commence any legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief. 
(1)  Injunctive relief.

The authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunction relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. The authority may also seek to recover civil penalties of up to $5,000.00 per day pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 54.018. 
(3)  Criminal proceedings. Notwithstanding any notice provisions contained in this subdivision, any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this subdivision commits an offense. The person shall be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each offense. 
(f)  Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. 
(1)  The authority, may, for good cause shown, suspend water or wastewater service to the discharger's facility when it appears to the authority that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interfere with the operation of a POTW, violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this subdivision or any permit issued pursuant to this subdivision. Any discharger notified of the suspension of the authority's water or wastewater service and/or the discharger's permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the authority, cease all discharges. In the event of the failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority may commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with such order or may immediately disconnect such discharger's service line from the city water and sanitary sewer system. In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the director shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or discharger before disconnecting the service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the illegal discharge and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
(2)  The authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater or water service upon proof by the discharger of the cessation of the noncomplying discharge or elimination of conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations for action in municipal or state court. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of this subdivision or a permit issued under this subdivision was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of this subdivision or the permit. In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe has been established, the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(1)  Affirmative defenses to upset. In an action brought in federal court, it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset, if the user demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and any discharger who experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this subdivision shall inform the authority within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, the authority may at its discretion require the discharger to file a written report within five working days. The report shall specify: 
a.  Description of the upset, its cause and the upset's impact on a discharger's compliance status. 
b.  Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur. 
c.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance. 
An operating upset which was not the result of negligence on the part of the discharger, and which has been documented and verified in the manner stated above shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the authority against a discharger for any noncompliance with the subdivision which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset. 
(2)  Affirmative defenses to specific prohibited discharge standards. It is an affirmative defense in federal court to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of subsection 86-88(a) or a specific prohibition of subsections 86-88(d)(1), (5), (7), (14) or (17), that the user did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(h)  Recovery of costs incurred by the authority. Any discharger who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the authority's wastewater system, shall be liable to the authority for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The authority shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the authority for any cleaning, repair or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Failure to pay such bill may result in the termination of water or wastewater service. 
(i)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this subdivision, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this subdivision, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in subsection (e)(3) herein. 
(j)  POTW pretreatment requirements. All POTW's shall be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements. All POTWs shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000.00 a day for each violation by industrial users of pretreatment standards and requirements. POTWs whose approved pretreatment programs require modification to conform to the requirements of this subsection shall submit a request for approval of a program modification in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.18, unless the state would be required to enact or amend a statutory provision, in which case the POTW shall submit such a request. 
(Ord. No. 1225-12, § 1(exh. A), 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 86-92. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Net/gross calculations. The authority may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the discharger's intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.15. 
(b)  Preservation of records. All dischargers subject to this subdivision shall retain and preserve for no less than three years and make available for inspection and copying, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring activities, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge and required by this article, and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements including documentation associated with best management practices established under subsection 86-88(e)(10). All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the authority pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.

Sec. 86-144. - Establishment of drainage (stormwater) utility fee and billing. 
(a)  Stormwater utility rate classes. A drainage (stormwater) utility fee is established, and the fee shall be imposed on each benefitted property within the city for services and facilities provided by the drainage (stormwater) utility system. For purposes of imposing the drainage (stormwater) utility fee, all eligible parcels within the city are classified into the following categories: 
(1)  Residential; and 
(2)  Nonresidential. 
(b)  Responsible party. 
(1)  The drainage (stormwater) utility fee shall be billed monthly along with other utilities provided to the property, including water, wastewater or refuse (or garbage) services. 
(2)  The bill imposing the drainage (stormwater) utility fee will be mailed to the customer who is currently established as the responsible party for water, wastewater and/or refuse service for the parcel. The customer recorded in the city utility billing system will be responsible for payment of the fee, regardless of whether such customer is the owner of the property. 
(3)  When there is no active customer account recorded in the city utility billing system for an improved parcel for water, wastewater, refuse or other utility service, or the improved parcel is otherwise considered by the city to be vacant, either on a temporary or permanent basis, or when an improved parcel is not served by other city utility services for any reason, the city may establish a "stormwater only account" and bill the owner of the parcel for the drainage (stormwater) utility fee, and the owner will be responsible for payment of the fee. 
(c)  Revision of rates. The city council shall establish the rates for the drainage (stormwater) utility fee by ordinance. The city council may review the schedule of rates at any time and may, by ordinance, increase or decrease the rates within the schedule, upon a determination that said increase or decrease is warranted. 
(d)  Billing procedures and policies. 
(1)  Any partial payment of the drainage (stormwater) utility fee will be applied against the amount due in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the city with regard to all utility services provided by the city. 
(2)  A late charge and interest may be imposed in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the city with regard to all utility services. 
(e)  Nonpayment. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by law or in this article, failure of a customer or owner to pay the charges of the drainage (stormwater) utility system promptly when due shall subject such customer or owner to discontinuance of any utility services provided by the city and/or placement of a lien against the property. The city may file suit to recover any charges due hereunder, together with maximum interest, attorney's fees and other costs and charges that may be allowed by the Act or other law, which is not paid when due.

Sec. 86-145. - Calculation of drainage (stormwater) utility fees. 
(a)  Applicability of stormwater utility fees. The city council hereby establishes the drainage (stormwater) utility fees as set forth herein. Drainage (stormwater) utility fees will be levied against all real property in the established service areas except real property that is exempted in the stormwater utility ordinance, article III of chapter 86 of the Richland Hills City Code. These fees shall be imposed and issued with utility billing statements issued on and after January 1, 2019. 
(b)  Calculation of stormwater utility fee. 
(1)  Stormwater utility fee calculation. The drainage (stormwater) utility fees contained herein shall be included in and become part of the city fee schedule contained as appendix A to the city Code and shall be calculated based on the total stormwater runoff potential for improved parcels for each customer class within the city measured as impervious area in square feet (SF). The monthly stormwater fee calculation is based on the average impervious area of 2,600 square feet for an equivalent residential unit (ERU). 
(2)  Stormwater utility fees. The total stormwater runoff potential for the service area shall be divided into the two customer classes of residential and non-residential based on the relative amount of impervious area in each class. 
a.  Residential property fees. Drainage (stormwater) utility fees for residential property, as defined in the stormwater utility ordinance, article III of chapter 86 of the city Code, shall be calculated as: 
1.  A monthly flat rate fee per equivalent residential unit (ERU). 
2.  One flat rate ERU fee will be charged for each dwelling unit on each residential parcel. 
3.  The flat rate fee to be charged is established in the schedule of charges include in subsection (3) below. 
b.  Non-residential property fees. Drainage (stormwater) utility fees for each improved non-residential property or allocated portion of a property shall be calculated based on the impervious area in square feet (SF) at the rate established in the schedule in subsection (3) below. 
(3)  Schedule of monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees. The monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees, as defined in the stormwater utility ordinance, article III of chapter 86 of the city Code, shall be as provided below: 
a.  The monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees for each residential dwelling unit, or ERU, as defined in the stormwater utility ordinance, article III of chapter 86 of the city Code, shall be $8.00 beginning January 1, 2019, and for each fiscal year thereafter. 
b.  The monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees for the impervious area, on each non-residential parcel, measured in square feet (SF), as defined in the stormwater utility ordinance, article III of chapter 86 of the city Code, shall be $0.00500 per square feet beginning January 1, 2019 and for each fiscal year thereafter. 
(4)  Revision of rates. The drainage (stormwater) utility fee may be revised by the city council by ordinance from time to time as permitted by law.

(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 13; Ord. No. 889-01, 1-9-2001) 
Sec. 86-182. - Residential and commercial rates. 
    The rates in appendix A for residential and commercial gas are the maximum applicable to residential and commercial consumers per meter per month or for any part of a month for which gas service is available at the same location. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 13(A); Ord. No. 889-01, 1-9-2001) 
Sec. 86-183. - Gas cost adjustment. 
    Each residential and commercial monthly bill at the rates in appendix A shall be adjusted for gas cost as follows: 
(1)  The city gate rate increase or decrease applicable to current billing month residential and commercial sales shall be estimated to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf based upon: 
a.  The city gate rate estimated to be applicable to volumes purchased during the current calendar month, expressed to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf (shown below as "Re"), less 
b.  The base city gate rate of $2.7535 per Mcf, multiplied by 
c.  A volume factor of 1.0216 determined in establishing the above rates for the distribution system as the ratio of adjusted purchased volumes divided by adjusted sales volumes. 
(2)  Correction of the estimated adjustment determined by subsection (1) of this section for the second preceding billing month shall be included as part of the adjustment. The correcting factor (shown below as "C") shall be expressed to the nearest $0.001 per Mcf based upon:

Sec. 86-184. - Weather normalization adjustment. 
(a)  Effective with bills rendered during the October 2000 through May 2001 billing months, and annually thereafter for the October through May billing months, the residential and commercial consumption rates for gas service as provided in this article and in appendix A, as adjusted, will be subject to a weather normalization adjustment each billing cycle to reflect the impact of variations in the actual heating degree days during the period included in the billing cycle from the normal level of heating degree days during the period included in the billing cycle. The weather normalization adjustment will be implemented on a per Mcf basis and will be applicable to the heating load of each customer during the period included in the billing cycle. It will be determined separately for residential and commercial customers based on heating degree data recorded by the D/FW Airport weather station. The adjustment to be made for each billing cycle will be calculated according to the following formula: 
WNA =  NDD - ADD / ADD × M × AHL 
Where: WNA = Weather normalization adjustment. NDD = Normal heating degree days during the period covered by the billing cycle. ADD = Actual heating degree days during the period covered by the billing cycle. M = Weighted average margin per Mcf included in the commodity portion of the rates effective during the October through May billing months. AHL = Actual heating load per customer.  
(b)  The heating load to which the weather normalization adjustment is to be applied for residential and commercial customers is determined by subtracting the base load for the customer from the total volume being billed to the customer. The base load of a customer is the average level of nonheating consumption. 
(c)  The weather normalization adjustment is subject to a 50 percent limitation factor based on temperatures being 50 percent warmer or colder than normal. The weather normalization adjustment will be calculated to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf.

--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1280-14, § 2, adopted Aug. 5, 2014, amended div. 4, entitled "Water Conservation and Emergency Water Demand Management Plan" in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 4, §§ 86-266-86-281 derived from: Code 1984, ch. 11, §§ 16(A)-(C); Ord. No. 874-00, §§ II, III, adopted Feb. 22, 2000; Ord. No. 1056-06, § 1, adopted June 13, 2006; and Ord. No. 1196-11, § A, adopted May, 10, 2011. 

Sec. 86-266. - General. 
    The water conservation and drought contingency and emergency water management plans outline the city's water conservation and emergency water demand management efforts. These efforts consist of two plans: (1) a water conservation plan; and (2) a drought contingency and emergency water management plan. The objective of these plans is to reduce the quantity required for each water using activity, insofar as is practical, through the implementation of efficient water practices. The plans also provide procedures for voluntary and mandatory actions to be put in place upon the city's water supply system during a drought or water emergency. The city will revise these plans as needed to meet objectives requested by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, regional water planning groups, the City of Fort Worth and to meet the goals stated in these plans. The plans established in this division shall be administered by the director of neighborhood services of the city or his/her duly appointed representative ("director"). 
(Ord. No. 1280-14, § 2, 8-5-2014) 
Sec. 86-267. - Water conservation plan. 
    The city has adopted a water conservation plan which is on file and available for inspection at the city secretary's office. The water conservation plan may be amended from time to time by adopting an ordinance amending the plan.

(a)  The city has adopted a drought contingency and emergency water management plan which is on file and available for inspection at the city secretary's office. The drought contingency and emergency water management plan may be amended from time to time by adopting an ordinance amending the plan. 
(b)  Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to establish the city's policy in the event of shortages or delivery limitations in the city's water supply and to establish water restrictions to be enforced in case of drought or emergency conditions. This section applies to: 
(1)  All persons and premises within the city using water from the water system; 
(2)  All retail customers who live in unincorporated areas within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction and are served by the water system; and 
(3)  All wholesale service customers outside the city to the extent provided in subsection (h). 
(c)  Authority. The director is authorized to implement measures prescribed when required by this section and by the drought contingency and emergency water management plan approved by the city council. The director is authorized to enforce the measures implemented and to promulgate regulations, not in conflict with this section, the plan or state and federal laws, in aid of enforcement. 
(d)  Initiation of plan stages. The director may order that the appropriate stage of the drought contingency and emergency water management plan be initiated upon determination that drought conditions or a water emergency exists. To be effective, the order must be: 
(1)  Made by public announcement to local media; and 
(2)  Published on the city's website. 
(e)  Duration of stage; change. A stage will remain in effect until the conditions that triggered initiation of the stage have been eliminated. If the stage is initiated because of excessive demands, all initiated actions will remain in effect through September 30 of the year in which they were triggered unless the director determines that conditions exist that will allow termination of the stage before September 30. When conditions change, the director may terminate, upgrade or downgrade the stage. Any such change must be made in the same manner prescribed in subsection (d). 
(f)  Violation of section. A person commits an offense if he knowingly makes, causes or permits a use of water contrary to the measures implemented by the director as prescribed in the plan. For purposes of this subsection, it is presumed that a person has knowingly made, caused or permitted a use of water contrary to the measures implemented if the mandatory measures have been formally ordered consistent with the terms of subsection (d) and: 
(1)  The manner of use has been prohibited by the drought contingency and emergency water management plan; 
(2)  The amount of water used exceeds that allowed by the drought and emergency water management plan; or 
(3)  The manner or amount used violates the terms and conditions of a compliance agreement made pursuant to a variance granted by the director. 
(g)  Penalties/enforcement of violations. Any person who is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and the drought contingency and emergency water management plan will be given a written warning that he has violated a mandatory water use restriction as a first offense. Any person who is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and the drought contingency and emergency water management plan may be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each subsequent offense. In addition, the following penalties shall apply: 
(1)  A person who is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and stage 1 of the plan as a second offense, shall be fined not less than $100.00. 
(2)  A person who is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and stage 2 of the plan as a second offense, shall be fined not less than $250.00. 
(3)  A person who is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and stage 3 of the plan as a second offense, shall be fined not less than $500.00. 
(4)  If a person is convicted of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to comply with a measure implemented in accordance with this section and the plan as a third offense, the director may either: 
a.  Install a flow restrictor in the water line to the premises where the violations occurred to limit the amount of water that may pass through the meter in a 24-hour period or a lock-out device to a backflow assembly; or 
b.  Discontinue water service to the premises where the violation occurred. 
(h)  Wholesale service to customers outside the city. The director shall advise customers receiving wholesale water service from the city of actions taken under the drought contingency and emergency water plan. The director may restrict service to customers outside the city as permitted under the contract and state law. 
(i)  Authority under other laws. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the mayor, the city council or the city manager to seek emergency relief under the provisions of any state or federal Disaster Relief Act. 
(j)  Variances. During the times the emergency order is operative, the director may grant variances only under the following circumstances and conditions: 
(1)  The applicant signs a compliance agreement on a form provided by the director, and approved by the city attorney, agreeing to use the water only in the amount and manner permitted by the variance; 
(2)  Granting of the variance would not cause an immediate significant reduction in the city's water supply; 
(3)  Failure to approve the variance would result in an extreme hardship or need relating to the health, safety or welfare of the applicant; and 
(4)  Granting the variance would not adversely affect the premises at which the violation occurred. 
(k)  Revocation of variances. The director may revoke a variance when he or she determines that: 
(1)  The conditions of subsection (j) are not being met or are no longer applicable; 
(2)  The terms of the compliance agreement are being violated; or 
(3)  Revocation is advisable to protect the health, safety or welfare of other persons. 
(l)  Appeal. Denial or revocation of a variance by the director may be appealed to the city manager by filing a written notice of appeal with the city manager within ten days after issuance of the director's decision. The city manager's decision shall be final.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 86-337. - Rules and regulations for providing water and sewer service to subdivisions. 
(a)  Basic policy. 
(1)  Subdivisions being subdivided for the retail sale of homesites, industrial, commercial and other residential subdivisions within the city shall be provided with water supply and distribution systems and with an approved sewage collection and disposal system. Connection with the sanitary sewer system shall be required. 
(2)  The developer shall pay all costs attributable to the installation of water and sewer facilities as are needed to fulfill the basic criteria requirements of the city for service within his subdivision. 
(3)  All subdivision extensions shall be covered by a written and executed agreement of form prepared or approved by the city attorney which clearly defines the scope and details of the proposed extension and particularly contains the developer's agreement to abide by all regulations of the city and to deliver to the city clear and unencumbered title to all the proposed improvements at the time of acceptance by the city, which must be prior to commencing service. 
(b)  Basis of extension. Where extensions of water and sanitary sewer systems are required to serve property which is to be subdivided or platted for development by a developer, water and sanitary sewer facilities may be extended to such properties on the following basis and in accordance with minimum standards and procedures described below: 
(1)  Plan to be approved. It shall be unlawful for any person to provide water and sewerage to any lot, plot of land, tract or any part thereof unless and until such plan, plat, or re-plat for such lot or tract of land has conformed to the platting requirements of the city, has been approved by the planning and zoning commission and has been filed for record with the county. Before consideration of a final plat by the planning and zoning commission, owners of the tract or subdivision shall submit to the director of public works, for his approval, a map or plat showing the location of water and sanitary sewer mains which will be required to ensure adequate service and fire protection to the lots specified in such proposed tract or subdivision. 
(2)  Extensions within property to be developed. Developers of such property will defray the entire cost of water and sanitary sewer system within their subdivision except that the city will refund the oversize cost of any water main or sanitary sewer main larger than six inches in size, unless a larger size is required to serve the subdivision in question. Size of mains for adequate service shall be determined by the engineer and submitted to the director of public works for approval. The request for city participation on oversize facilities shall be submitted to the city council for their approval prior to any construction taking place. Refunds for oversize cost will be made upon acceptance of the systems by the city. All water and sanitary sewer mains shall be extended to the tract or addition line in order to provide service to adjacent property where applicable. The city reserves the option of requiring all on-site sewage flows generated by any development or part thereof to be delivered to a single location for off-site disposal. Should a lift station and/or force main be required to utilize a provided off-site service location, such lift station and/or force main shall be installed at the developer's cost. Where a lift station is required to be constructed, the developer shall provide allweather access facilities, initial power supply and a wet-well for such lift station at developer's cost. The drawings shall be submitted to the director of public works for approval prior to beginning construction. When a treatment plant is necessary to serve a development or any part thereof, the developer is to provide, at no cost to the city, the sewage treatment plant, all-weather facilities and initial power supply. Additionally, when the city in its permit requirements is required to provide treatment greater than secondary or is required to pipe the effluent beyond the discharge point of the plant location, the developer shall pay for all costs for such equipment connected with such additional treatment or pipe extensions. Developers of such property will defray the entire cost of such lift station, force main and/or sewage treatment plants except that the city will refund the oversize cost of any lift station force main and sewage treatment plant larger than that is necessary to serve the subdivision in question. Capacity of such lift station, force main and/or sewage treatment plant necessary to serve the subdivision shall be determined by the engineer and submitted to the director of public works for approval. The director of public works' decision will be final. The request for city participation on oversize facilities shall be submitted to the city council for their approval prior to any construction taking place. Refunds for oversize cost will be made upon acceptance of the system by the city. 
(3)  Mains lying along one or more sides of a subdivided tract. 
a.  For mains six inches in size, the developer will be refunded one-half of the actual construction cost of the size main constructed. The request for city participation on oversize cost shall be submitted to the city council for approval prior to any construction taking place. Such refunds will be made upon acceptance of the system by the city. 
b.  For mains larger than six inches in size, the developer will be refunded the difference between the cost of such water and/or sanitary sewer main and one-half the cost of six-inch main or such larger sizes as are required to serve the subdivision for which extensions are required, provided the developer has advanced the total cost of such mains. The request for city participation on oversize cost shall be submitted to the city council for approval prior to any construction taking place. Refunds will be made upon acceptance of the system by the city. 
(4)  Off-site extensions. Where water and/or sanitary sewer facilities are not available to a tract to be developed, the city will pay for such facilities to the subdivision property line within the following limitations: 
a.  The request for city participation on off-site facilities shall be submitted to the city council for their approval prior to any construction taking place. If the request is denied, the developer may install these facilities at his entire expense. If the city council approves the request and funds are available, refunds will be made upon acceptance of the system by the city and upon application by the owner. 
b.  If funds are not available for the city's participation at the time of acceptance, the city may enter into a contract with the developer to reimburse him for 100 percent of the city's cost of off-site facilities. Payment on this contract will be based on 50 percent of the water and sewer revenue received for water and sewer service received from this subdivision each year until the full cost has been recovered, if such arrangement is approved by the city council. 
(c)  Control of meters. All water furnished by the water department to its consumers shall be measured by meters. The size, type and right to own and control all meters installed or used by consumers shall be determined by the water department. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 4(C)) 
Sec. 86-338. - Fees due city for existing mains and lift stations. 
    When an existing water or sanitary sewer main lies in a street, alley or easement in or adjacent to an area or tract of land to be subdivided and developed, the developer shall pay to the public works department the applicable pro rata charge for the water main and sanitary sewer main before extensions from or connections to such line or lines are made. Should such existing main lie alongside the subdivision, one-half of these costs shall be paid if the city has participated in the original construction cost. 
(1)  Methods of procedures. Water and sanitary sewer main extensions to serve a subdivision in the city may be accomplished in the following manner: 
a.  Upon approval by the city, a developer shall have his engineer design and prepare construction drawings of water and sanitary sewer facilities to serve the subdivision including any off-site facilities that may be required. These drawings shall conform in all details to the city's standard specifications as to design, grade, location, size and quality of materials and construction. 
b.  Plans and profiles submitted by the developer's engineer shall be on standard 24-inch by 36-inch sheets of blueline paper. Plans and profiles shall be shown at scales of one inch to 40 feet or one inch to 100 feet horizontal, and one inch to four feet vertical, unless approval is given otherwise. Plans and profiles shall show clearly all surface improvements, all existing or proposed subsurface utility lines and obstructions and street and alley grades as approved by the department of public works. The engineer submitting the plans and profiles must affix his seal and signature to the tracings of all drawings. 
c.  Upon preliminary approval of the drawings by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with a water and sewer contractor approved by the city; provided however, that the construction and installation of the water mains and sanitary sewer mains shall be viewed by inspectors of the city to see that the installation is made in accordance with the drawings and the city's standard specifications which in every instance shall be a part of such installation contract. 
d.  Upon preliminary approval, the engineer for the developer will be furnished with three blank forms of the standard city developer agreement. This agreement shall be executed by the water and sewer contractor, shall be executed by the developer and approved by the city prior to any construction beginning in the subdivision. The contract entered into between the developer and a contractor shall provide for a performance bond, payment bond and a two-year maintenance bond, which is a part of the standard city developer agreement. Each of the bonds referenced in this subsection shall be in an amount equal to the total contract price. 
e.  Upon final approval, the developer's engineer shall furnish the city such prints as the city may require. There shall also be furnished to the city half size mylar reproducibles of the drawings. When the project is ready for construction and the plat has been filed with the county, it shall be the responsibility of the developer's engineer to furnish line and grade stakes on water and sanitary sewer mains, water and sewer services, fire hydrants, manholes and manhole tops. After installation and acceptance by the city, the developer's engineer shall furnish one as-built set of drawings to the city. No installation of water and/or sanitary sewer mains will be made at any other location except a dedicated street, alley or an easement running in favor of the city, which shall be filed of record by the owner of such addition. Any such installation, when made, shall become the property of the city, free and clear of all encumbrances. 
f.  The city specifically reserves the option to advertise for bids and install all or any portion of extension of off-site water and sanitary sewer mains and oversize water and sanitary sewer mains. When the extension or improvement is to be installed under contract between the city and contractor, the cost of which is to be paid wholly or partially by a developer, the contractor shall not be authorized to commence work until after the city has received the full amount due in cash from the developer, such amount to be placed in escrow. 
g.  After final completion of the work to the satisfaction of the director of public works, a letter of acceptance will be furnished to the developer. No payment in an amount more than 90 percent of the total cost of the water and sewer contractor's work shall be made to the water and sewer contractor by the developer until such letter has been received. 
(2)  General disposition of funds. Any and all sums of money hereinafter collected as a fee or connection charge at the rate set out in this section shall be credited to the water and sewer fund of the city. 
a.  City not obligated if funds not available. In no event shall the city be obligated to proceed under the terms of this division if funds are not available or if in the discretion of the city the extension may not be practical. Nothing in this division shall be construed as a surrender by the city of its control over streets, alleys, public ways or public easements. The decision of the director of public works shall be final in determination of line size and approval of drawings and specifications. 
b.  Standard specifications. All water and sanitary sewer work shall be done in accordance with the revised standard specifications for waterworks and sewerage improvements in the city, as adopted by the city council, and the latest revisions thereof. 
c.  Treatment plants and lift stations upon public property. Where it is necessary to provide a treatment plant or lift station as a part of the sewer service to a development or any part thereof, all portions of such treatment facilities or lift stations including access roads thereto shall be upon public property or within an easement or right-of-way secured by an appropriate written instrument suitable for filing with the county clerk. 
d.  No vested rights. No person shall acquire any vested rights under the provisions of this division.

The city, in its sole discretion, may provide the subdivider with a copy of schedule I prior to final plat approval, but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this article. 
(2)  For a development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, for which no replatting is necessary prior to issuance of a building permit, and which plat has been recorded with the county, or for lots which predate the city's subdivision regulations and which are exempt from platting requirements, assessment shall occur on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit set forth in schedule I. 
(b)  Following assessment of the impact fee for a new development pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the amount of the impact fee per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final plat approval, in which case the impact fee will be reassessed at the schedule I rate then in effect. 
(c)  The impact fees due for the new development shall be collected prior to or at the time of issuance of the building permit, unless an agreement has been executed between the property owner and the city providing for a different time of payment. 
(d)  Following the filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit or the request for a connection to the city's water and/or wastewater systems, the city shall compute the impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The amount of each impact fee due shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the impact fee due per service unit for the benefit area using schedule II. The number of service units shall be determined by using the conversion table contained in the impact fee studies. 
(2)  The amount of each impact fee due shall be reduced by any allowable credits for that category of capital improvements in the manner provided in section 86-369. 
(3)  The amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the maximum impact fee per service unit under schedule I by the number of service units generated by the development. 
(4)  If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees due shall be computed using schedule II then in effect, and previous payments of impact fees shall be credited against the new fees due. 
(5)  Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using schedule II then in effect, and such additional fee shall be collected at the time building permits are issued for a development or construction on each benefited property.

Sec. 86-369. - Exemptions, credits and rebates. 
(a)  For any new development which has received final plat approval in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.001 et seq., or pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations (or for which an application for final approval has been made prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived) the city may assess, but shall not collect, water impact fees on any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued within one year subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(b)  If the building permit, which is obtained within the period provided for in subsection (a) of this section subsequently expires, and no new application for a building permit is approved within such one-year period, payment of an impact fee shall be required prior to issuance of a new building permit, as provided for in section 86-367. 
(c)  A property owner who has paid a wastewater system facility access fee as required by Fort Worth may reduce the amount of a wastewater impact fee due for a new development for a given service unit by the amount of the access fee paid, following written request and approval by the city, provided that no construction has occurred on the lot or tract and that no utility connection has been made. 
(d)  If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, no utility connections for that category of capital improvements have been made to the development, and a modified or new application has not been approved within six months of such expiration, the city shall, upon written application, rebate the amount of the impact fee to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid. If no application for rebate pursuant to this subsection has been filed within this period, no rebate shall become due. 
(e)  The following shall also be exempted from payment of the impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional or larger water and/or sewer connections are requested. 
(2)  The replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use where no additional or larger water and/or sewer connections are requested. 
(3)  The installation of a replacement mobile home on a lot or other such site when a water and/or sewer impact fee for such mobile home site has previously been paid pursuant to this section or where a mobile home legally existed on such site on or prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives. 
(4)  Any building permit application which was duly accepted for filing prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives and which is subsequently granted shall be exempt from the assessment and payment of an impact fee, unless such application thereafter expires. 
(f)  Any claim of exemption must be made by the owner or feepayer no later than the time of application for connection to the city's water and/or sewer system. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
(g)  Credits and exemptions shall not be transferable from one project or development to another or from one component of the water and sewer impact fee to another component of this fee. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(I)) 
Sec. 86-370. - Establishment of accounts. 
(a)  The city shall establish an account to which interest is allocated for each benefit area for each type of capital facility for which an impact fee is imposed pursuant to this article. Each impact fee collected within the benefit area shall be deposited in such account. 
(b)  Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used solely for the purpose authorized in section 86-371. 
(c)  The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to assure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in section 86-371. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this article; provided, however, that funds shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date that an impact fee has been paid. 
(d)  The city shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees, which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended from each benefit area. The records of such accounts shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(J)) 
Sec. 86-371. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts.

(b)  Funds for the water impact fee account established in section 86-370 may only be used for water facilities purposes and funds from the sewer impact fee account similarly established may only be used for sewer facilities purposes. Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
(c)  If bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities for which water and sewer facilities impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type described in this article. 
(d)  At least once each fiscal year the city manager shall present to the city council a proposed capital improvement program for water and sewer facilities, assigning funds, including any accrued interest, from the several water and sewer impact fee accounts to specific water and sewer facilities improvement projects and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same water and sewer impact fee accounts until the next fiscal period except as provided by the refund provisions of this section. Monies may be transferred to the general fund of the city to reimburse the general fund for the cost associated with the engineering associated with the establishment of the impact fee ordinance and the preparation of the required impact fee studies to support this article. 
(e)  Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in section 86-373. 
(f)  Funds may be used to rebate developer costs for providing water and/or sewer capital facilities in excess of the capacity required to the individual developer making the provision. Any rebates must be pursuant to a refunding agreement between the developer and the city after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Prior refunding agreements may be renegotiated in order to bring such agreements into accord with the provisions of this article. 
(g)  Funds may be used for any other purposes permitted by law as deemed appropriate by the city council.

(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(K)) 
Sec. 86-372. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or feepayer for a new development may appeal the following decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The amount of the impact fee due; 
(3)  The denial of or determination of the amount of a credit; 
(4)  The application of a credit against an impact fee due; and 
(5)  The amount of a refund due, if any. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the amount of the fee or the amount of the credit was not calculated according to the applicable schedule of impact fees or the guidelines established for determining credits. 
(c)  The appellant must file a written notice of appeal with the city within 30 days following the decision. The development application may be processed while the appeal is pending, if the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient security satisfactory to the city manager in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(L)) 
Sec. 86-373. - Refunds. 
(a)  Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article, which has not been expended or otherwise encumbered within the benefit area within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in V.T.C.A., Finance Code § 302.002. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall also be considered expended if, within ten years following the date of payment, the total expenditures for capital improvements or facility expansion authorized in section 86-371 within the benefit area for such improvements or expansions exceeds collections during such period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the benefit area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facility expansion identified in the capital improvements plan for the benefit area, the city shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the city shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid per service unit by more than ten percent. If the difference is less than ten percent, no refund shall be due. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(M)) 
Sec. 86-374. - Review and update of plan and revision of fees. 
(a)  The advisory committee shall monitor and evaluate the implementation of the capital improvements plan and file semiannual reports with respect to the progress of such plan and report to the city any perceived inequities in implementing the plan or imposing the impact fee, and shall advise the city council of the need to update or revise the land use assumptions, capital improvements plan and impact fee. 
(b)  The city shall update its land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at least every three years, commencing from the date of adoption of such plans, and may recalculate the impact fees based thereon in accordance with the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.001 et seq. 
(c)  The city may review its land use assumptions, capital improvements plans, impact fees and other factors such as market conditions more frequently than provided in subsection (b) of this section to determine whether the land use assumptions and capital improvements plans should be updated and the impact fee recalculated accordingly, or whether schedule I or II should be revised. 
(d)  If, at the time an update is required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the city council determines that no change to the land use assumptions, capital improvements plans or impact fee is needed, it may dispense with such update in conformance with the procedures in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.001 et seq. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(N)) 
Sec. 86-375. - Other financing mechanisms.

    Impact fees established by this article are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land, the issuance of building permits or the connection of utilities. Such fee is intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of the city's comprehensive land use plan, the capital improvements plan, the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. 
(Code 1984, ch. 11, § 14(P)) 
Sec. 86-377. - Relief procedures. 
(a)  Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which an impact fee has been paid may petition the city council to determine whether any duty required by this article, other than those matters which may be appealed pursuant to section 86-372, has not been performed within the time frame so prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the duty be performed within 60 days of the request. If the city council determines that the duty is required pursuant to the section, and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence within 60 days of the date of the request and to continue until completion. 
(b)  The city council may grant a variance from any requirement of this section, upon written request by a property owner subject to the section, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in the confiscation of the property. 
(c)  If the city council grants a variance that reduces the amount of the impact fee due for a new development under this article, it shall cause to be appropriated from other city funds the amount of the reduction in the impact fee and deposit such funds in the account for the benefit area in which the property is located.

Secs. 86-384-86-410. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VIII. - DEPOSITS, CHARGES AND BILLING PROCEDURE 

Sec. 86-411. - Application for service. 
    Each new customer can call by telephone or come by the office located in city hall to apply for service. A deposit and an activation fee as provided in appendix A is required with application for service. If possible, one full day's notice should be given. When this is not possible, every effort will be made to accommodate the customer. It is preferable for the customer to be present when service begins to avoid damage in case of broken pipes or leaks. 
Sec. 86-412. - Deposit policy. 
    A deposit is required to open an account. Deposits remain on the account until the account is closed. At that time, the deposit applies to the final balance due to the account, and if applicable, the difference is refunded. Deposits are based on the schedule as provided in appendix A. 
Sec. 86-413. - Utility bill. 
    The utility bill will be mailed each month approximately 14 days prior to the due date. The time of the month of the billing depends on the physical location of the service within the city. In most cases, the bill will contain itemized charges for water, sewer, garbage, EPA surcharge and drainage. It will also reflect the consumption in 100-gallon increments and the reading by which that consumption has been calculated. Messages and other information regarding the city may be printed on the bill. If there are questions regarding the bill, the number to call will be on the bill. 
Sec. 86-414. - Payment methods. 
    Bills may be paid by mail, in person during regular office hours or by using the after hours depository box. The 24-hour depository box is located on the north side of city hall. The depository box is emptied each working day at 8:00 a.m. The return portion of your bill should be included with the payment whenever possible. 
Sec. 86-415. - Delinquent payments and reconnect policy. 
    Payments received after the due date will be assessed a ten percent penalty and interest fee. Any customer whose bill is more than 30 days past due shall have water service discontinued. In order to reinstate water service, the customer must: (i) pay delinquent bill in full; (ii) pay service charge as provided in appendix A; and (iii) pay additional an deposit as provided in appendix A. Bills not paid before 5:00 p.m. will not be reconnected until the next business day. The only notification for discontinuance of service a customer will receive is a red stamp notice on the most current bill stating that service will be discontinued if not paid by the due date. 
Sec. 86-416. - Additional charges. 
    If water service is turned on by any other person other than city personnel, the water meter shall be pulled or locked immediately and an additional charge as provided in appendix A will be assessed to resume service. If meter or lock is damaged, the customer will also be charged the cost of repair or replacement. A service fee as provided in appendix A will be charged for all returned checks. 
Sec. 86-417. - Determination of residential sewer rates. 
    Residential customers are billed sewer charges based on their average winter water consumption. The water consumption for December, January and February is averaged each year and that becomes the maximum sewer flow they will be billed for the next nine months (March-November). Using this method, customers are not billed sewer charges for water uses that do not impact the sewer system. 
Sec. 86-418. - Service interruption. 
    At times, the water utilities department may need to interrupt water service on a street or in an area of the city. This is most often done to make repairs of some kind. The water utilities department will do the best to notify someone at each home or business, but this may not always be possible in the event of an emergency. 
Sec. 86-419. - Donations through utility billing. 
    The city manager and city finance director are authorized to modify city's utility billing format and procedures to provide utility account holder the opportunity to donate up to $1.00 each to the parks and beautification fund, the library fund, and the animal shelter fund, when paying their monthly utility bill. The donations received from such utility billing process shall be dedicated to the specific fund or funds to which the paying utility account holder designates.

ARTICLE IX. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 86-446. - Program adoption. 
    The City of Richland Hills ("city") developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program ("program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule ("rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. 16 C. F. R. § 681.2. This program was developed for the utility department of the city ("utility") with oversight and approval of the city council. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the city council determined that this program was appropriate for the city's utility, and therefore approved this program on August 28, 2008. 
(Ord. No. 1129-08, § 2(Exh. A), 8-28-2008) 
Sec. 86-447. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Establish an identity theft prevention program. To establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the program in compliance with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003. 
(b)  Establishing and fulfilling requirements of the Red Flags Rule. The Red Flags Rule ("rule") defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" ("red flag") as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
    Under the rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
(1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
(2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
(3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
(4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(c)  Red Flags Rule definitions used in this program. 
    City: The City of Richland Hills, Texas. 
    Covered account: Under the rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and

(Ord. No. 1129-08, § 2(Exh. A), 8-28-2008) 
Sec. 86-451. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. At least annually, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the utility maintains and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities, consult with law enforcement authorities, and consult with other city personnel. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will update the program or present the city council with his or her recommended changes and the city council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Ord. No. 1129-08, § 2(Exh. A), 8-28-2008) 
Sec. 86-452. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the utility. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the utility or his or her appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the utility or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports. Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
    All utility staff shall submit reports monthly concerning the utility's compliance with the program, the training that has been given and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft, including recommendations for changes to the program. While incidents of identity theft are to be reported immediately to the program administrator, the monthly reports shall contain a recap of the incident and include the steps taken to assist with resolution of the incident. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including but not limited to franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

In no event shall financial considerations alone be considered good cause. 
(b)  The pipeline operator shall take reasonable steps to preserve all trees within the city easement or right-of-way in which the pipeline operator's pipeline facility is located and shall replace any trees which are removed or which, in the determination of the landscape administrator, die because of pipeline facility construction, modification or repair operations, with approved trees of equal size up to four caliper inches in size. For each tree larger than four caliper inches in size which is removed or, in the determination of the landscape administrator, dies because of pipeline facility construction, modification or repair, the pipeline operator may elect to plant a single approved tree of equal or greater size or multiple trees which collectively total an equal or greater number of caliper inches as the tree which is removed or dies. The pipeline operator shall refer to the city's landscape ordinance for a list of approved trees. Any replacement trees need not be planted in the same location or even within the pipeline easement, but instead may be planted as follows: (1) at other locations on the affected lot as agreed between the pipeline operator and the lot owner; or (2) if the lot owner elects to forego planting any such replacement trees on the affected lot, at such other location owned by the lot owner within the city as agreed upon by the pipeline operator and the lot owner; or (3) if the lot owner elects to forego planting any such replacement trees on property within the city owned by the lot owner, at such location on city property as designated by the landscape administrator. If the pipeline operator fails to plant such replacement trees within 90 calendar days of the completion of construction of the pipeline facilities, or such later time as agreed upon by the pipeline administrator has agreed to in writing, the pipeline operator shall pay to the city an amount equal to the fair market value of such replacement trees, including planting costs, as determined by the landscape administrator, and such amount shall be placed in a tree mitigation fund to be used by the city for landscaping and tree planting. 
(c)  Design requirements: 
(1)  In all zoning districts except the I-2 Heavy Industrial zoning district, the pipeline operator shall enclose all gas compressor units within sound attenuation structures compatible with the visual appearance of the surrounding development as set forth in this section; and 
(2)  A pipeline operator shall design and construct all above-ground pipeline related improvements and structures in accordance with all landscaping, setback and height requirements applicable in the zoning district where such equipment is located, and in accordance with all landscaping, design and materials requirements of this article. All above-ground pipeline-related improvements not fully enclosed in a structure shall be screened from any public right-of-way and any residentially or commercially zoned property either by a masonry fence or by a wrought iron fence or approved evergreen trees and/or shrubs. All shrubs shall be no less than 48 inches in height when planted, and no less than 72 inches when mature. All trees shall be a minimum of two caliper inches in size when planted. If pipeline related improvements are to be screened by landscaping, and such improvements exceed 72 inches in height, such improvements will be screened by both shrubs and trees meeting the requirements specified above. All such landscaping shall be in addition to and not in lieu of other landscaping required by this article or other city ordinance; and 
(3)  All landscaping required shall be maintained by the pipeline operator for so long as such above-ground pipeline-related improvements or structures remain on the property; and 
(4)  If such gas compressor unit is located in a residential zoning district, the required sound attenuation structure unit shall have the visual appearance of a roof with a slope or pitch which is not less than the greater of (i) 5/12; or (ii) the average roof pitch of existing residential structures located within 1,000 feet of the lot on which the structure will be constructed. The pipeline operator may achieve the desired appearance by application of one of the following design devices: (i) a flat roof with a sloped structural element along the perimeter of the roof to provide the appearance of a sloped roof; or (ii) if no roof is provided, a sloped structural element along the perimeter of the top of the structure to provide the appearance of a sloped roof; and 
(5)  Prior to commencing construction of such above-ground improvements and/or structures, the pipeline operator must first obtain a pipeline above-ground improvement permit allowing construction of such improvements and/or structures. Any application for such permit shall be filed with the pipeline administrator and shall be accompanied by the required fee and three copies of proposed design and landscape plans showing compliance with the requirements of this article. If the permit complies with the requirements in this article, the pipeline administrator shall provide a copy of such plans to the chief building official and the landscape administrator. All construction shall comply with the design and landscape plans approved by the city. Such application shall be deemed approved if not rejected within 15 days of the date of the application; and 
(6)  Except to the extent expressly permitted otherwise in this article, structure facades shall be constructed to comply with the design and exterior masonry and materials requirements of the zoning district in which such structure is located, as specified in chapter 90 of this Code; and 
(7)  Any screening required around a compressor station may be located immediately adjacent to compressor pad site. 
(d)  All above-ground pipeline facilities and any related equipment and improvements, including all gas regulator and compressor station equipment shall comply with the city's lighting and noise ordinance standards, and shall not create any noise that causes the exterior noise level to exceed the pre-development ambient noise levels as measured at the property line of the lot upon which such pipeline facilities, equipment or improvements are located by more than five decibels in commercial and industrial zoning districts and zero decibels in residential zoning districts. The pipeline operator shall be responsible for contacting the city code enforcement department and arranging for the establishment of the pre-development ambient noise level prior to issuance of the building permit for the pipeline facility. 
(Ord. No. 1142-09, § I, 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 86-510. - Pipeline facilities installation conditions. 
(a)  A pipeline operator shall comply with the conditions established in this section governing mapping, inventorying, locating or relocating of the pipeline facility within private residential areas within the boundaries of the municipality. 
(b)  All new or relocated pipeline facilities within private residential areas shall be located within existing pipeline corridors within the city, or if there is no existing pipeline corridor available for such installation, along the perimeter of such property and as far from any existing or planned buildings as physically possible, unless the pipeline operator of the pipeline facility is able to demonstrate to the pipeline administrator that such alignment is infeasible. In addition to the criteria for a variance set forth in this article, the pipeline administrator shall consider the following criteria when determining the feasibility of locating the pipeline facility in existing pipeline corridors in the city: 
(1)  The availability and cost of existing pipeline corridor space; and 
(2)  The availability and cost of easement rights to and from the existing pipeline corridor; and 
(3)  Environmental, aesthetic, and development cost issues related to building, operating and maintaining both the portion of the pipeline facility that would be located in the existing pipeline corridor and the lengths of the pipeline facility required to gain access to and from the existing pipeline corridor; and 
(4)  Any delays in right-of-way acquisition or construction of the pipeline facility that may result from routing through an established pipeline corridor; and 
(5)  The availability of an alternative easement path to the pipeline operator. 
(c)  If the pipeline administrator determines it is not feasible for a pipeline facility to be located within an existing pipeline corridor within private residential areas, and unless tree preservation regulations dictate otherwise, the pipeline operator of such pipeline facility must: 
(1)  For platted property, be located within mandatory front, side yard or rear setback areas; and 
(2)  For un-platted property, be contiguous and adjacent to the property boundaries of fee parcels or existing easements to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of land and avoid diagonal routes that would create unusable slivers of land; and 
(3)  Avoid conflict with the location and opening of existing and planned future streets and laying of planned water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer lines. 
(Ord. No. 1142-09, § I, 3-10-2009)

b.  Restore all streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, sanitary sewers, stormwater sewers and other drainage facilities and all other public improvements and public or franchised utilities that may be injured or damaged in the construction of any pipeline facilities permitted under the license to their condition immediately preceding the commencement of such construction activities or better; and 
c.  Remove all litter, machinery, buildings, trash and waste used, accumulated or allowed in the course of such construction activities within ten calendar days of the completion of such construction activities. 
(3)  The bond must be approved by the pipeline administrator and filed with the city secretary. Such bond shall become effective upon the granting of the license and must remain in full force and effect so long as such pipeline is in operation, and until all work under the terms of such license has been completed and the license is terminated. Such bond may later be amended to include other pipeline facilities operated by the pipeline operator upon the request of the pipeline operator; and 
(4)  A pipeline operator that operates or plans to operate multiple pipeline facilities in the city may utilize a blanket bond in a form mutually agreed upon by the pipeline administrator and the pipeline operator. 
(b)  In the event that a license is issued for a pipeline facility or other operations under this article for installing, constructing, maintaining, repairing, replacing, modifying, removing or operating a pipeline facility on, over, under, along or across any affected city streets, rights-of-way or other city property, unless otherwise agreed in such license agreement, no actual operation shall be commenced until the pipeline operator files with the city secretary the following insurance policies: 
(1)  Worker's compensation at statutory limits; and 
(2)  Employer's liability, including bodily injury by accident and by disease, for $500,000.00 combined single limit per occurrence and a 12-month aggregate policy limit of $1,000,000.00; and 
(3)  Commercial general liability coverage, including blanket contractual liability, products and completed operations, personal injury, bodily injury, broad form property damage, operations hazard, pollution, explosion, collapse and underground hazards, with minimum personal injury/bodily injury limits of $1,000,000.00 per person and $5,000,000.00 per occurrence, minimum property damage limits of $10,000,000.00 per occurrence, and a 12-month aggregate policy limit of $10,000,000.00; and 
(4)  Automobile liability insurance (for automobiles used by the pipeline operator in the course of its performance under the license, including employer's non-ownership and hired auto coverage) for $2,000,000.00 combined single limit per occurrence. 
(c)  Each such policy shall (i) name the city and its officers, officials, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns as additional insured parties; (ii) be issued by a carrier with an A.M. Best Financial Strength rating of "A-" or better; and (iii) remain in full force and effect and be carried so long as such pipeline facility is operated and until all work under the terms of such license has been completed and the license is terminated. A certificate of insurance shall be furnished annually by the applicant or the subsequent pipeline operator showing that such insurance is and continues in effect. If any such policy is written as "claims made" coverage and the city is required to be carried as an additional insured, then the pipeline operator subject to this article shall purchase policy period extensions so as to provide coverage to the city for a period of at least two years after the last date that the license is in effect. 
(d)  The city may adjust the bond and insurance policy limits described above every five years during the term of the license, or sooner as determined by city council, to compensate for the effects of inflation with the objective to maintain the value of coverage as of the effective date of this article. 
(e)  Each policy or an endorsement thereto, except those for worker's compensation and employer's liability, shall name the city and its officers, officials, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns as additional insured parties, but limited to risks indemnified pursuant to this article. No deductible shall exceed $1,000,000.00 per occurrence or one percent of the consolidated net worth of such pipeline operator and its permitted affiliates, whichever is greater. 
(f)  Each pipeline operator subject to this article shall assume and bear any claims or losses to the extent of deductible amounts. 
(g)  All such policies and certificates shall contain an agreement that the insurer shall notify the city in writing not less than 30 calendar days before any material change, reduction in coverage or cancellation of any policy. Each pipeline operator subject to this article shall give written notice to the city within seven calendar days of the date upon which total claims by any party against such pipeline operator reduce the aggregate amount of coverage below the amounts required by this article. 
(h)  Each policy must contain an endorsement to the effect that the insurer waives any claim or right in the nature of subrogation to recover against the city, its officers, officials, employees, successors and assigns. 
(i)  Each policy must contain an endorsement that such policy is primary insurance to any other insurance available to the city as an additional insured with respect to claims arising thereunder. 
(j)  In the event an operator and its affiliates install multiple pipeline facilities within the city, then the operator and its affiliates shall only be required to obtain one blanket bond and one certificate of insurance, provided that the cumulative coverage provided is at least as great as the total that would be provided using separate bonds in the amounts required herein for all facilities within the city. Individual bonds and separate insurance certificates for each individual pipeline facility shall not be required. 
(k)  Each pipeline operator may comply with the insurance requirements of this section through a combination of self-insurance, primary and excess insurance policies, provided that for any self-insurance component, the pipeline operator provides the administrator with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the city establishing the existence of sufficient self-insurance funds.

Section 1.06. - Nonconforming uses, structures and lots 
1.06.01. Intent of Provisions 
(A)  Existence of nonconformities 
(1)  The purpose of this section is to establish provisions for the allowance and potential alteration of uses, lots, and/or structures that do not conform to currently applicable standards or regulations, but that were in conformance with standards in place at the time of their inception, and have been rendered nonconforming due to a change in the applicable standards and regulations. 
(a)  Nonconformities occur in three general categories, or combinations thereof: 
1.  Nonconforming lots as described in subsection 1.06.02.(A)(1) below. For example, a nonconforming lot can be nonconforming as to lot area or dimension requirement. 
2.  Nonconforming structures as described in subsection 1.06.02.(A)(1) below. For example, a nonconforming structure can be nonconforming as to a dimension requirement, masonry requirement, or landscaping requirement. 
3.  Nonconforming uses are uses as described in subsection 1.06.02.(A)(1) below. For example, a nonconforming use can be the actual use, or the parking requirement associated with that particular use. 
(2)  It is the declared intent of this section that nonconforming uses and structures eventually be eliminated and be required to comply with the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance, having due regard for the property rights of the person affected, the public welfare, and the character of the surrounding area. 
1.06.02. Establishment of Legal Nonconforming Status 
(A)  Existence. For purposes of interpretation of this subsection, any uses, structures, or lots that in whole or part are not in conformance with current zoning standards shall be considered as follows: 
(1)  Legal nonconforming. Those uses, structures, or lots that in whole or part are not in conformance with current zoning standards, but were legally established at a prior date at which time they were in conformance with applicable standards. Such uses, structures or lots may be maintained or potentially altered subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
(2)  Illegal status. Those uses, structures, or lots that in whole or part are not in conformance with current zoning standards and were not in conformance with applicable standards at the time of their inception shall not be considered legal nonconforming, but shall be considered illegal uses, structures, or lots and shall not be approved for any alteration or expansion, and shall undertake necessary remedial measures to reach conformance with current standards, or be discontinued. 
(B)  Time of adoption. Any use, platted lot, or structure that is a lawful use at the time of the adoption of any amendment to this Ordinance but by such amendment is placed in a district wherein such use, platted lot, or structure is not otherwise permitted shall be deemed legal nonconforming. 
1.06.03. Burden of Demonstration 
    The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity as defined in this subsection shall be borne by the owner or proponent of such nonconformity. 
1.06.04. Continuing Lawful Use of Property and Existence of Structures 
(A)  Discontinuance of nonconforming use 
(1)  If a nonconforming use shall cease operations for a period of more than six months, then such nonconforming use shall be deemed to be permanently discontinued. Unless the board of adjustment reinstates the nonconforming rights pursuant to section 6.10 Reinstatement of Nonconforming Rights of this Ordinance, such a use shall not be instituted on that parcel or other parcel in any district that does not permit the discontinued use. 
(2)  For the purpose of this paragraph, to "cease operations" shall mean to intentionally terminate operations of the nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use that does not involve a permanent type of structure or operation and that is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been discontinued, regardless of intent. 
(B)  Reinstatement of nonconforming use rights. An owner and/or operator of a nonconforming use that has been deemed permanently abandoned pursuant to subsection (A) above, may request that the nonconforming rights to the use be reinstated pursuant to section 6.10 Reinstatement of Nonconforming Rights of this Ordinance. 
(C)  Prohibited expansion or reoccupation. A nonconforming use or structure shall not be expanded, reoccupied with another nonconforming use, or increased as of the effective date of this Ordinance except as provided in section 1.06.06. below. 
(D)  Existing platted lots are conforming lots. Any existing lot platted prior to May 6, 2014, which was legally conforming, shall be deemed a conforming lot. 
1.06.05. Changing Uses and Nonconforming Rights 
(A)  Nonconforming use to conforming use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use, and once such change is made, the use shall not be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(B)  Nonconforming use to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
(C)  Conforming use in a nonconforming structure. Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the use may be changed to another conforming use by the process outlined in section 1.06.06. below. 
1.06.06. Expansion of Nonconforming Uses and Structures 
    An expansion of a nonconforming use or structure is allowed in accordance with the following: 
(A)  Nonconforming use expansion in existing building 
(1)  A nonconforming use located within a building may be extended throughout the existing building, provided: 
(a)  No structural alteration may be made on or in the building except those required by law to preserve such building in a structurally sound condition; and 
(b)  The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling units or rooms existing at the time said use became a nonconforming use. 
(2)  Nonconforming use within a building shall not be extended to occupy any land outside the building. 
(B)  Off-street loading, parking, and landscaping requirements. Requirements for parking and landscaping for a nonconforming structure shall be as stated in the supplementary ordinances. 
(C)  Residential lot exemption. The minimum residential lot areas for the various zoning districts shall be in accordance with their respective districts, except that a lot having less area than herein required that was an official "lot of record" prior to May 6, 2014 may be used for a single-family dwelling. 
(D)  Nonconforming building expansion with conforming uses. Buildings or structures that do not conform to the area regulations or development standards in this Ordinance but where the uses are deemed conforming shall not increase the gross floor area greater than ten percent from the date when the building became nonconforming. The expansion must be conforming. 
(E)  Reuse of abandoned or vacant buildings by conforming uses allowed. Buildings or structures that have been vacant or abandoned for more than six months and do not meet the current area regulations or development standards shall be allowed to be reoccupied only by a conforming use. 
1.06.07. Restoration of Nonconforming Structures 
(A)  Total destruction. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire, the elements, or other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. 
(B)  Partial destruction. In the case of partial destruction of a nonconforming structure up to 51 percent of its total appraised value as determined by the Appraisal District, reconstruction will be permitted, but the existing square footage or function of the nonconforming structure cannot be expanded. 
1.06.08. Movement of Nonconforming Structures 
(A)  Relocation of a nonconforming structure within a platted lot. Nonconforming structures may be relocated within the same platted lot. 
(B)  Compliance. Nonconforming structures shall comply with all setback and screening requirements once relocated. 
1.06.09. Completion of Structures 
    Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use of the following: 
(A)  Approved building. A building or structure for which a building permit has been issued or a site plan approved prior to May 6, 2014. 
(B)  Building in the approval process. A building or structure for which a complete application for a building permit was accepted by the building official on or before the effective date of these regulations, provided however, that such building permit shall comply with all applicable ordinances in effect on the date such application was filed.

Table 3. Maximum Permissible Daytime* Octave Band (Decibel Limits at the Bounding Property Line **) 
Octave Band (cps) Decibel Band Limit (db re 0.0002 microbar) 37 - 75 86 75 - 150 76 150 - 300 70 300 - 600 65 600 - 1,200 63 1,200 - 2,400 58 2,400 - 4,800 55 4,800 - 9.600 53 A Scale 65  
Note: "A Scale: levels are provided for monitoring purposes only and are not applicable to detailed sound analysis. 
* "Daytime" shall refer to the hours between sunrise and sunset on any given day. 
** "Bounding Property Line" shall be interpreted as being at the far side of any street, alley, stream, or other permanently dedicated open space from the noise source when such open space exists between the property line of the noise source and adjacent property. When no such open space exists, the common line between two parcels of property shall be interpreted as the bounding property line. 
(1)  General noise level standards. The following corrections shall be made to the table of octave band-decibel limits in determining compliance with the noise level standards: 
(a)  When noise is present at nighttime, subtract 7dB. 
(b)  When noise contains strong pure-tone components or is impulsive, that is when meter changes at 10 decibels or more per second, subtract 7dB. 
(c)  When noise is present for not more than the following, add 10dB: 
1.  1/2 minute in any 1/2 hour period; 
2.  1 minute in any 1-hour period; 
3.  10 minutes in any 2-hour period;

(d)  Transient noise of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks and airplanes. 
(e)  Events sanctioned by the City of Richland Hills. 
(B)  Smoke and particulate matter. No operation or use shall cause, create, or allow the emission for more than three minutes in any one hour of air contaminants that at the emission point or within the bounds of the property are: 
(1)  Of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than does smoke or contaminants in the standard prescribed by the American Society for Testing and Materials, except that, when the presence of uncombined water is the only reason for failure to comply or when such contaminants are emitted inside a building that prevents their escape into the atmosphere. 
(2)  The emission of particulate matter from all sources shall not exceed 0.5 pounds per acre of property within the plant site per any one hour. 
(3)  Open storage and open processing operations, including on-site transportation movements that are the source of wind- or air-borne dust or other particulate matter; or that involves dust or other particulate air contaminants, generating equipment such as used in paint spraying, grain handling, sand or gravel processing or storage or sand blasting shall be so conducted that dust and other particulate matter so generated are not transported across the boundary line of the tract on which the use is located in concentrations exceeding four grains per 1,000 cubic feet of air. 
(C)  Odorous matter 
(1)  No use shall be located or operated that involves the emission of odorous matter from a source of operation where the odorous matter exceeds the odor threshold at the bounding property line or any point beyond the tract on which such use or operation is located. The odor threshold shall be established as a nuisance that would offend a person of average sensibilities. 
(2)  The odor threshold as herein set forth shall be determined by observation by a person. In any case, where uncertainty may arise or where the operator or owner of an odor emitting use may disagree with the enforcing officer or where specific measurement of odor concentration is required, the method and procedures specified by American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) shall be followed. 
(D)  Fire or explosive hazard material 
(1)  No use involving the manufacture or storage of compounds or products that decompose by detonation shall be permitted except that chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, phosphorus, and similar substances and compounds in small quantities for use by industry, school laboratories, druggists or wholesalers may be permitted when approved by the Fire Marshal of the City of Richland Hills who has determined compliance with the fire code. 
(2)  The storage and use of all flammable liquids and materials such as pyroxylin plastics, nitrocellulose film, solvents, and petroleum products shall be permitted only when such storage or use conforms to the standards and regulations of the adopted fire code. 
(E)  Toxic and noxious matter. No operation or use shall emit a concentration across the bounding property line of the tract on which such operation or use is located of toxic or noxious matter that will exceed ten percent of the concentration considered as the threshold limit for an industrial worker as such standards are set forth by the Texas State Department of Health in "Threshold Limit Values Occupational Health Regulation No. 3", a copy of which is hereby incorporated by reference. 
(F)  Vibration. No operation or use shall at any time create earthborne vibrations that, when measured at the bounding property line of the source operation, exceed the limits of displacement set forth in the following table in the frequency ranges specified: 
Table 4. Vibration Measurement 
Frequency Cycles per Second Displacement in Inches 0 to 10 0.0010 10 to 20 0.0008 20 to 30 0.0005 30 to 40 0.0004 40 and over 0.0003  
(G)  Lighting. Standards for controlling lighting and glare are set forth to reduce the annoyance and inconvenience to property owners and traffic hazards to motorists. These standards are intended to allow reasonable enjoyment of adjacent and nearby property by their owners and occupants while requiring adequate levels of lighting of parking areas. 
(1)  Nonresidential site lighting and glare standards 
(a)  Any use shall be operated so as not to produce obnoxious and intense glare or direct illumination across the bounding property line from a visible source of illumination of such intensity as to create a nuisance or detract from the use or enjoyment of adjacent property or to be offensive to a person of average sensibilities. All outside lights shall be made up of a light source and reflector so selected that acting together, the light beam is controlled and not directed across any bounding property line above a height of three feet. The allowable maximum intensity measured at the property line of a residential use in a residential district shall be 0.25 foot candles. Light poles shall be placed on the site a setback equal to its height from all adjacent residential property. 
(b)  All off-street parking areas for nonresidential uses in nonresidential districts that are used after dark shall be illuminated beginning one-half hour after sunset and continuing throughout the hours of business operation. If only a portion of a parking area is offered for use after dark, only that part is required to be illuminated in accordance with these standards. However, the portion offered for use shall be clearly designated. Lighting within the parking areas shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
1.  Intensity 
(i)  Minimum at any point on the parking area surface to be at least 0.6 foot candles initial, and at least 0.3 foot candles maintained or one-third of the average, whichever is greater. 
(ii)  Illumination shall not exceed an average of one foot candle at ground level and shall distribute not more than 0.25 foot candles of light upon any adjacent residentially zoned area. 
2.  Height 
(i)  The maximum height of light poles shall conform to the maximum height allowed for the main building in each zoning district. 
(ii)  Special lighting or lighting higher than the height allowed in the applicable zoning district may be approved by city council as specifically noted on the site plan. 
(2)  Residential lighting and glare standards. Residential lighting for security and night recreation use is permitted in all residential districts provided the following requirements are met: 
(a)  Direct lighting over ten feet in height is shielded from adjacent property. 
(b)  No light source shall exceed 20 feet in height. Street lights and other traffic safety lighting are exempt from this standard. 
(c)  Lighting shall not directly shine on adjacent dwellings. 
(3)  Luminaires. Light sources shall be of a down-light type, indirect, diffused, or shielded type luminaires installed and maintained so as to reduce glare effect (i.e., minimum 70 degrees] cutoff when measured from horizontal) and consequent interference with use of adjacent properties and boundary streets. Bare bulbs above 75 watts and strings of lamps are prohibited, except for temporary lighting as provided in the section below. 
(4)  Special or temporary lighting - low wattage. Bare bulbs or strings of lamps are prohibited, except for the following cases: 
(a)  During holidays special lighting shall be permitted for a maximum time period of 45 days for each holiday used; and

Section 6.09. - Amortization of Nonconforming Uses 
(A)  City council initiation of amortization case. Only the city council, by majority vote, may request that the board of adjustment consider establishing a compliance date for a nonconforming use. 
(B)  Board of adjustment decision of amortization case 
(1)  Per the authorization of city council, the board of adjustment may require the discontinuance of a nonconforming use under any plan whereby the full value of the use's structure and facilities can be amortized within a definite period of time, taking into consideration the general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the zoning regulations. 
(2)  All actions to discontinue a nonconforming use shall be taken with due regard for the property rights of the persons affected when considered in the light of the public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the nonconforming use and the conservation and preservation of property. 
(C)  Public hearing process. Upon receiving a request from the city council, staff shall schedule the first public hearing before the board. The board may establish a compliance date only after holding two separate public hearings. 
(1)  First public hearing. The board shall hold a public hearing to determine whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have a significant adverse effect on nearby properties. If, based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the board determines that continued operation of the nonconforming use will have a significant adverse effect on nearby properties, it shall schedule a second public hearing to establish a compliance date for the nonconforming use; otherwise, it shall not. In determining whether the continued operation will have a significant adverse effect on nearby properties, the board shall consider the following factors: 
(a)  The character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(b)  The degree of incompatibility of the use with the zoning district in which it is located. 
(c)  The manner in which the use is being conducted. 
(d)  The hours of operation of the use. 
(e)  The extent to which continued operation of the use may threaten public health or safety. 
(f)  The environmental impacts of the use's operation, including but not limited to the impacts of noise, glare, dust, and odor. 
(g)  The extent to which public disturbances and nuisances may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(h)  The extent to which traffic or parking problems may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(i)  Any other factors relevant to the issue of whether continued operation of the use will adversely affect nearby properties. 
(j)  To the extent the nonconforming use impacts the value and marketability of the abutting and surrounding properties or neighborhood. 
(2)  Second public hearing 
(a)  If the board has determined in the first public hearing that the nonconforming use has an unacceptable adverse effect on nearby properties, it shall hold a second public hearing to set a date for compliance. The board shall, in accordance with the law, provide a compliance date for the nonconforming use under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. The following factors must be considered by the board in determining a reasonable amortization period: 
1.  The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment, and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly transferred to another site) on the property before the time the use became nonconforming. 
2.  Any costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation expenses, termination of leases, and discharge of mortgages. 
3.  Any return on investment since inception of the use, including net income and depreciation. 
4.  The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including net income and depreciation. 
5.  A reasonable closeout and termination period for the nonconforming use. 
(b)  If the board, at the first public hearing, requests financial documentation and/or records from the owner relating to the factors listed directly above, the owner shall provide said documents and/or records at least 30 days before the second public hearing. If the owner does not provide said documentation, the board is authorized to make its determination of a compliance date based upon any reasonably available public records as well as public testimony at the hearing. Failure by owner to provide the requested financial documents and records shall not prevent the board from setting a compliance date. 
(D)  Ceasing operations. If the board establishes a compliance date for a nonconforming use, the use must cease operations on that date and it may not operate thereafter unless it becomes a conforming use. 
(E)  Definitions. For purposes of this subsection, "owner" means the owner of the nonconforming use at the time of the board's determination of a compliance date for the nonconforming use. 
(F)  Finality of decisions 
(1)  Decisions that cannot be immediately appealed. A decision by the board that the continued operation of a nonconforming use will have a significant adverse effect on neighboring property and the board's decision to schedule a second public hearing to establish a compliance date are not final decisions and cannot be immediately appealed. 
(2)  Decision to deny a request to establish a compliance date. A decision by the board to deny a request to establish a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten calendar days in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211. 
(3)  Decision setting a compliance date. A decision by the board setting a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten calendar days in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211.

Section 6.10. - Reinstatement of Nonconforming Rights 
(A)  Loss of nonconforming rights status. If the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use has been discontinued under subsection 1.06.04.(B) Reinstatement of Nonconforming Use Rights, and has lost its nonconforming rights, the use shall not be instituted on that parcel or other parcel in any district that does not permit the discontinued use. 
(B)  Notice to owner and/or operator required. Notice of this determination shall be made in writing to the owner and/or operator of the discontinued use. 
(C)  Application for nonconforming rights reinstatement 
(1)  The owner and/or operator of the abandoned nonconforming use may submit a written application to the board to have the nonconforming rights reinstated. 
(2)  Written application for reinstatement of nonconforming rights must be made within ten business days after the zoning administrator issues the written notice of determination that a use has been permanently abandoned. 
(D)  Board decision. The board may reinstate nonconforming rights only if the board finds there was a clear intent not to abandon the use even though the use was discontinued for six months or more. The failure of the owner and/or operator to remove on-premises signs shall not be considered (on its own) evidence of a clear intent not to abandon the use.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if circumstances warrant proceeding without notice, no notice shall be required. In any case, failure to give such notice shall not prohibit the city from pursuing any available remedy. 
(2)  If the operator does not cure the alleged failure within the time specified by the city, the city may notify the railroad commission to request appropriate action. In addition, the city may pursue all other remedies allowed by law, including, but not limited to the following:

UTILITIES86-111 Sewer rates: The following sewer or wastewater charges shall be made to customers on the Richland Hills' sewer system: (1) Separately metered residential: All residential customers with a single living unit supplied with water from one meter shall be charged the following sewer or wastewater charges for each meter service: (a) All residential customers with a single living unit who are supplied with sewer service shall be charged a monthly sewer base charge of $33.35. (b) In addition to the monthly sewer or wastewater base charge, residential customers with a single living unit who are supplied with sewer service shall be charged a monthly excess sewer or wastewater volume charge of $0.00198 for each gallon of total water used (and wastewater produced) in excess of 2,000 gallons (the amount included in the sewer or wastewater base charge). (c) For purposes of this calculation, the monthly water usage (and wastewater produced) shall be determined using the customer's average monthly water usage (and wastewater produced) during the preceding winter quarter months of December, January and February. When no preceding winter average data are available from prior customer records, an estimated average monthly winter average volume of 10,000 gallons shall be used to calculate the monthly excess sewer or wastewater charge per residential unit. (2) When two or more residential living units are supplied with water from one meter, the sewer or wastewater service shall be classified as multifamily residential sewer or wastewater service. Multifamily residential sewer or wastewater service customers shall be charged the following sewer or wastewater charges for each meter service: (a) A monthly sewer or wastewater base charge of $33.35 (the monthly sewer or wastewater base charge for the standard 3/4-inch water meter equivalent for a separately metered residential unit), multiplied by an occupancy factor of 80%, multiplied by the total number of multifamily residential units supplied by the meter. (b) In addition to the monthly base sewer or wastewater charge, multifamily residential customers who are supplied with sewer service shall be charged a monthly sewer or wastewater excess volume usage charge. Monthly sewer or wastewater excess volume charges will be assessed on the basis of the number of adjusted residential units served by the meter. The number of "adjusted multifamily residential units" shall be the actual number of multifamily residential units served by the meter, multiplied by an occupancy factor of 80%, rounded up to the nearest whole number. (c) Each adjusted multifamily residential unit shall be assessed a sewer or wastewater excess volume charge each month calculated as follows: 1) The monthly winter average water volume, or estimated sewer volume, used shall be divided by the number of adjusted multifamily residential units to determine the monthly volume usage per adjusted multifamily residential unit; 2) The monthly winter average water volume per adjusted multifamily residential unit shall then be reduced by 2,000 gallons (the amount of usage included in the base charge) to determine the excess sewer or wastewater usage per multifamily residential unit; 3) The total excess sewer or wastewater usage shall then be assessed at a rate of $0.00198 for each gallon of total winter average water used (and wastewater produced) in excess of the first 2,000 gallons of volume usage included in the base charge; 4) The excess sewer or wastewater usage charge per unit shall then be multiplied by the adjusted multifamily residential units supplied water by the meter to obtain a total volume charge for winter average water usage for the meter. (d) For purposes of this calculation, the monthly winter average sewer or wastewater usage shall be determined using the customer's average monthly water usage (and wastewater produced) during the preceding winter quarter months of December, January and February. When no preceding winter average data are available from prior customer records, an estimated average monthly winter average volume of 10,000 gallons shall be used to calculate the monthly excess sewer or wastewater charge per multifamily residential unit. (3) The following sewer or wastewater charges shall be made to nonresidential customers on the Richland Hills' sewer system: (a) The monthly minimum sewer or wastewater base charge shall be $38.50 for the first 2,000 gallons of actual water used (and wastewater produced) during the monthly billing period. (b) In addition to the monthly base charge, nonresidential customers who are supplied with sewer service shall be charged a monthly excess sewer or wastewater volume usage charge of $0.00325 for each gallon of total water used (and wastewater produced) over the first 2,000 gallons of winter average water volume usage included in the base charge). 86-144 Drainage (stormwater) utility fees: 1. The monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees for each Residential dwelling unit, or ERU, as defined in the Stormwater Utility Ordinance, Article III of Chapter 86 of the City Code, shall be as follows for each fiscal year beginning October 1st: FY2009 shall be $8.00, FY2010 shall be $8.50, FY2011 shall be $9.00, FY2012 shall be $9.50, FY2013 shall be $10.00, FY2014 shall be $10.50, FY2015 shall be $11.00, FY2016 shall be $11.50, FY2017 shall be $12.00, FY2018 shall be $12.50, and FY2019 shall be $13.00. 2. The monthly drainage (stormwater) utility fees for the impervious area, on each Non-residential parcel, measured in square feet (SF), as defined in the Stormwater Utility Ordinance, Article III of Chapter 86 of the City Code, shall be as follows for each fiscal year beginning October 1st: FY2009 shall be $0.00308 per SF, FY2010 shall be $0.00327 per SF, FY2011 shall be $0.00347 per SF, FY2012 shall be $0.00366 per SF, FY2013 shall be $0.00385 per SF, FY2014 shall be $0.00404 per SF, FY2015 shall be $0.00424 per SF, FY2016 shall be $0.00443 per SF, FY2017 shall be $0.00462 per SF, FY2018 shall be $0.00481 per SF, and FY2019 shall be $0.00500 per SF. The drainage (stormwater) utility fee may be revised by the City Council by ordinance from time to time as permitted by law.

2.3 - Duty to notify of change. 
    Grantee represents that the communication system will be utilized exclusively for the rendering of communication services. If the nature or character of communication services changes in any manner in the future to include the offering of telecommunication or other services not expressly permitted under this license or if there is an increase in the size or number of any poletop radio transmitter/receiver (or like aboveground apparatus) than was contemplated in the adoption of this license, as described in the application, then grantee shall notify the city in writing as soon as practicable. Such notice shall be served at least 60 days prior to the effective date of any change in the nature or character of the communication services or in the poletop radios (or like aboveground apparatus). 
2.4 - Compliance with city requirements.

If not accepted within 30 days, this agreement shall be null and void and of no effect and no license shall exist between METRICOM and the city. 
SECTION 3. - REGULATION OF THE USE OF PUBLIC WAYS 

3.1 - Conditions of street occupancy. 
    All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines, and equipment installed or erected by grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own property abutting any of said public ways. 
3.1.1  Approval of plans and specifications. Grantee shall provide complete plans and specifications for all construction within streets to the designated city official for their review at least 30 days prior to the start of any construction during the term of this license. In the event of rejection, grantee shall submit revised plans and specifications for approval. This provision shall apply to each construction sequence if the construction is accomplished in phases. All such construction shall comply with all applicable ordinance(s), including ordinances which may be adopted after the date of this license. "All applicable ordinances" shall include, but are not limited to, building and fire codes and zoning regulations. Such construction and this license shall be expressly subject to all deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants, restrictions and encumbrances which may affect the public ways. 
3.1.2  Maps. Grantee shall provide the city with a map (of general specificity) showing the approximate location of major components of grantee's communication system within the city which is attached hereto or will be attached hereto as Exhibit A. Upon written request of the city, grantee shall update such map to reflect actual or anticipated improvements to the system. Any such map (or update thereof) so submitted shall be for informational purposes only and shall not obligate grantee to undertake any specific improvements, nor shall such map be construed as a proposal to undertake any specific improvements. Grantee shall submit such map (and updates thereof) to the city in "GIS" format, unless such map (or updates thereof) cannot be prepared in a commercially reasonable manner in such format. 
3.2 - Restoration of public ways. 
    If during the course of grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of the communication system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the grantee, it shall, at its expense, replace and restore such public way to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance. 
3.3 - Relocation at request of city. 
    Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than 30 business days, grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the public way, or remove from the public way, any property of grantee when required by city by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of structures or improvements by the city; but, grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. 
3.4 - Relocation at request of third party. 
    Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of such building, provided: 
(a)  The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of wires is paid by said person, including, if required by grantee, making such payment in advance; and 
(b)  Grantee is given not less than 14 business days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
3.5 - Vegetation management. 
    Grantee and the city agree in principle to a line clearance standard that balances the aesthetic needs of the community while enhancing service reliability. Grantee's commitment is to respond promptly to city-identified tree-related hazards. Grantee shall reasonably compensate the property owner for any damages caused by such trimming, or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the system undertaken by grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations grantee may have to the property owner pursuant to the terms of this section 3. 
3.6 - Safety requirements. 
    Construction, installation, and maintenance of the communication system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other federal, state, and local regulations.

3.7 - Aboveground construction. 
    Unless agreed to in writing by both city and grantee, or approved by the appropriate body of the city, no communication system shall be erected or operated on any aboveground poles, facilities or structure except these now or hereinafter owned or leased by one of the city's franchised public utilities, or as provided in section 3.8b. below. 
3.8 - Use, rental or lease of utility poles and facilities. 
a.  There is hereby granted to grantee the authority to contract with the city or any appropriate board or agency thereof or with the holder or owner of any utility license in the city for the use, rental or lease of its or their poles and other structures and facilities for the purpose of supporting or carrying grantee's radios wires, cables, electronic conductors and other facilities and appurtenances necessary or desirable in conjunction with the operation of its communication system.

b.  Grantee may request space in the city-owned poles and structures as may be available; however, such permission is within the sole discretion of the city and must be granted in writing. 
SECTION 4. - COMPENSATION TO CITY 

4.1 - Payment to city. 
4.1.1  Administrative fee. An administrative fee is assessed grantee as consideration for the administrative processing cost incurred in the initial adoption of this license, and for the continued monitoring and enforcement of same. Grantee agrees to pay the city an administrative fee of $2,000.00 upon acceptance of the ordinance (with a credit of $850.00 from the application fee). Nothing herein shall preclude the city from recovering any administrative costs incurred by the city in the approval of permits or in the supervision, inspection or examination of all work by grantee in the service area as prescribed in accordance with applicable ordinances or laws. 
4.1.2  Public way use fee, license fee and late payment charge. 
a.  The city finds that the public streets, alleys and rights-of-way to be used by grantee in the operation of its communication system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties, acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to grantee of the use of said public streets, alleys and rights-of-way is a valuable property right, without which grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, therefore, grantee agrees to pay to the city as general compensation for the use of the public way during each year of this license ordinance, an amount equal to five percent of gross revenues as defined in section 1.1 herein, or $125.00, whichever is greater, as an on-going administrative fee, for each quarter of each calendar year. 
b.  Grantee shall pay an amount equal to this quarterly payment by the 15th day of the second calendar month immediately following the close of the calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated. Any necessary prorations shall be made in the first and last year of the license. 
c.  In the event any quarterly payment is made after noon on the date due, grantee shall pay a late payment penalty of the greater of: 
(i)  One hundred dollars; or 
(ii)  Simple interest at a ten percent annual percentage rate on the total amount past due. 
d.  Grantee shall obtain on all billing addresses in the city the zip code plus four digits. 
4.2 - Quarterly report. 
    In order to properly determine the gross revenues received by grantee, grantee agrees that on the same date that each quarterly payment is made, it will file with the director of finance a sworn copy of a report, in a form acceptable to the city, in sufficient detail to itemize revenues from each of the revenue categories. The city may, if it sees fit, have the books and records of grantee examined by a representative of said city to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. Neither the acceptance of any payment nor any subsequent review shall be deemed an agreement by the city that the correct payment was paid, absent a fully authorized release by the city on any such payments or on such reports. 
4.3 - Recalculation at end of compensation year. 
    At the end of each calendar year, grantee shall recalculate the total general compensation actually due. If additional amounts are due the city by grantee, said amounts shall be paid by the 15th day of February following the calendar year during which such amounts were originally due. If amounts are found to be due grantee by the city, said amounts shall be credited by the 15th day of February during which such amounts were originally due. Any necessary prorations shall be made. 
4.4 - Taxes are not to be a credit. 
    The compensation paid under this license shall be exclusive of and in addition to all special assessments and taxes of whatever nature, including, but not limited to, ad valorem tax, sales tax, corporate or business occupation taxes or other taxes or fees imposed or levied by any governmental entity. 
4.5 - Rights of city. 
    Payment of money under this license shall not in any way limit or inhibit any of the privileges or rights of the city, whether under this license or otherwise. 
4.6 - Annual report. 
    Grantee shall file annually with the director of finance no later than 90 days after the end of grantee's fiscal year, a certified statement of revenues (for that year) attributable to the operations of grantee's system, within the city pursuant to this license ordinance. This statement shall present a detailed breakdown of gross revenues and uncollectible accounts for the year. 
4.7 - Circumventing payments. 
    Any transaction(s) which have the effect of circumventing payment of the required license fees and/or evasion of payment of license fees or any payments due the city under this license by non-collection or non-reporting of gross revenues, bartering, or any other means which evade the actual collection of revenues for business pursued by grantee are prohibited. 
4.8 - Transfer of license. 
    Grantee's right, title, or interest in the license shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate, without the prior consent of the city, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of grantee in the license or communication system in order to secure indebtedness. 
SECTION 5. - ACCOUNTS, BOOKS AND RECORDS 

5.1 - City to be informed. 
    Grantee shall keep the city fully informed as to all matters in connection with or affecting the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of grantee's system, grantee's accounting methods and procedures in connection therewith, and the recording and reporting by grantee of all revenues and uncollectibles. Grantee shall report to the city such other information relating to grantee as the city may consider useful and shall comply with the city's determination of forms for reports, the time for reports, the frequency with which any reports are to be made, and if reports are to be made under oath. 
5.2 - Accounts. 
    Grantee shall keep complete and accurate books of account and records of its business and operations pursuant to this license ordinance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, subject to review and approval by the city. The city may require the keeping of additional records or accounts which are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting gross revenues and uncollectibles for purposes of section 4 hereof. Grantee shall keep its books of account and records in such a way that breakdowns of revenues are available by type of service within the city. 
5.3 - Access to records. 
    Grantee shall provide the city with access at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes, to examine, audit, review and/or obtain copies of the papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other records of grantee pertaining to this license ordinance. Grantee shall fully cooperate in making available its records in Tarrant County, and otherwise assisting in these activities. 
5.4 - Inquiries to grantee. 
    The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to grantee's operation of its system within the city. Grantee shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
SECTION 6. - INSURANCE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND BONDS OR OTHER SURETY 

6.1 - Insurance requirements. 
    Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the license, comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00 combined single limit for bodily injury, and property damage. Said insurance shall designate the city as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable [noncancelable] except upon 30 days' prior written notice to the city. 
6.2 - Indemnification. 
    Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the city, its officers, boards and employees from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of its communication system, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Grantee further agrees not to oppose intervention by the city in such a suit, however, any intervention will be at the city's sole cost and expense. 
6.3 - Bonds and other surety. 
    Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the license or continuing its existence. In order to minimize such costs, the city agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. The city agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than $200,000.00, conditioned upon the substantial performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the license. Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the city agrees to give grantee at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof stating the reason for the requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in grantee's legal, financial, or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the license or afford compliance therewith. 
SECTION 7. - ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE 

7.1 - Notice of violation. 
    In the event that the city believes that grantee has not complied with the terms of the license, it shall notify grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance. 
7.2 - Grantee's right to cure or respond. 
    Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in [section] 7.1: 
(1)  To respond to the city contesting the assertion of noncompliance, 
(2)  To cure such default, or 
(3)  In the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the 30 day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the city of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. 
7.3 - Public hearing. 
    In the event that grantee fails to respond to the notice described in section 7.1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7.2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 31 days after grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to section 7.1, the city shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city which is scheduled at a time which is no less than 5 business days therefrom. The city shall notify grantee of the time and place of such meeting and provide grantee with an opportunity to be heard. 
7.4 - Enforcement. 
    Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the city, after such meeting, determines that grantee is in default of any provision of the license, the city may: 
a.  Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under this license, if any, including without limitation, any bonds or other surety; provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such amount as the city reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default; 
b.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; 
c.  In the case of a material breach of the license, declare the license agreement to be revoked; or 
d.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages. 
    Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly with any provision of the license by reason of any failure of the license authority to enforce prompt compliance. 
7.5 - Acts of God. 
    Grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions of the license, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other events reasonably beyond its ability to control. 
SECTION 8. - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

8.1 - Actions of city. 
    In any action by the city or representative thereof mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
8.2 - Notice. 
    Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response to be served upon the city or grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party 5 business days after having been posted in a properly sealed and correctly addressed envelope by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, at a post office or branch thereof regularly maintained by the U.S. Postal Service.

The I-Net will be of a star or point-to-point configuration serving all public buildings, including, but not limited to, municipal buildings, K-12 public and private nonprofit schools, in the franchise area. The buildings (as designated in Exhibit E), and any new public facilities constructed during the term of the franchise agreement, will be connected to the grantee's hub site and an umbilical fiber cable which will be connected to the central hub site serving the franchise area. The I-Net fibers will be part of the grantee's subscriber network maintained at the same level as the grantee's active subscriber network. 
3.  The I-Net will be connected, in the designated buildings, at a predetermined demarcation point chosen by the grantor, with a rack or equivalent device installed to mount to grantee's fiber optics connectors and patch panel. Fiber will be run to each designated building in conduit with locator tape as part of the standard installation. 
4.  Grantee will provide professional engineering and consulting for the design and use of the I-Net. 
B.  Design. Within no more than four months after the effective date of the franchise agreement, grantee and its network consultants will provide a design of the I-Net capacity requested by the grantor. The design shall include the following: 
(i)  A walkout of the public buildings to which I-Net capacity will be provided; 
(ii)  A detailed network design; 
(iii)  A breakdown of all material, equipment, labor and facilities required to provide I-Net capacity; and 
(iv)  Any material, equipment, labor and facilities required to provide intercity connections as set forth in section E hereof. 
Upon receipt of the design, grantor shall have one month to enter into an I-Net agreement. 
C.  Usage fee. Throughout the term of the franchise, commencing upon activation of the I-Net capacity, grantor shall pay grantee no usage fee.

D.  Use of I-Net capacity. 
1.  Grantor use. Grantor may use the I-Net capacity set forth in the I-Net agreement for those services which grantee may legally provide under federal, state and local law.

Grantor shall only use the I-Net capacity for noncommercial, governmental communication uses in accordance with this Exhibit and the I-Net agreement. 
2.  Grantee use. Grantee shall own all equipment and facilities, outside the demarcation point set forth in section E hereof, used to provide the I-Net capacity to the grantor. Grantee shall have the right to use any bandwidth or I-Net capacity not specifically guaranteed to the grantor under the I-Net agreement. The I-Net agreement shall provide that in the event grantee shall cease operation of the cable system during the term of the franchise agreement for any reason, without a transfer of the franchise agreement being approved by the grantor, the ownership of all equipment and facilities comprising the I-Net (specifically including any equipment designated as owned by grantee pursuant to section E herein) shall transfer to the grantor. 
E.  Equipment responsibility.

    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF RICHLAND HILLS, TEXAS: 
    SECTION 1. That there is hereby granted to TXU Electric Company, its successors and assigns (herein called "TXU Electric"), the right, privilege and franchise to construct, extend, maintain and operate in, along, under and across the present and future streets, alleys, highways, and public grounds and ways of the City of Richland Hills, Texas (herein called "city") electric light and power lines, with all necessary or desirable appurtenances (including underground conduits, poles, towers, wires, transmission lines and other structures, and telephone and communication lines for its own use), for the purpose of supplying electricity to the city, the inhabitants thereof, and persons, firms and corporations beyond the corporate limits thereof, for light, heat, power and other purposes. 
    SECTION 2. Poles, towers and other structures shall be so erected as not to unreasonably interfere with traffic over streets, alleys and highways. 
    SECTION 3. TXU Electric's property and operations within the corporate limits of the city shall be subject to such reasonable rules and regulations of the city as may be authorized by applicable law from time to time for the protection of the general public. Grantee shall construct its facilities in conformance with the applicable provisions of the National Electric[al] Safety Code or such comparable standards as may be adopted. TXU Electric may require a reasonable security deposit for payment of bills rendered its customers within the city, but in no event shall it be inconsistent with the standards for such deposits set by the Public Utility Commission of Texas. 
    SECTION 4. TXU Electric shall hold the city harmless from all expense or liability for any act or neglect of TXU Electric hereunder. 
    SECTION 5. This franchise is not exclusive, and nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to prevent the city from granting other like or similar rights, privileges and franchises to any other person, firm or corporation. 
    SECTION 6. In consideration of the grant of said right, privilege and franchise by the city and as full payment for the right, privilege and franchise of using and occupying the said streets, alleys, highways and public grounds and ways, and in lieu of any and all occupation taxes, assessments, municipal charges, fees, easement taxes, franchise taxes, license and inspection fees or charges, street taxes, street or alley rentals, certain regulatory expenses under Section 33.023 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, Title 2, Texas Utilities Code (PURA), as amended, or any similar or successor law, and all other taxes, charges, levies, fees and rentals of whatsoever kind and character which the city may impose or hereafter be authorized or empowered to levy and collect, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes which the city is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property, sales and use taxes, and special assessments for public improvements, and excepting the company's obligation to reimburse the city for street repairs, which is not affected by company's payment of franchise fees hereunder, TXU Electric shall pay to the city, annually, the following: 
(a)  For the period beginning on the effective date of this ordinance [November 28, 2000], and ending December 31, 2001, a sum equal to four percent of its gross receipts received by TXU Electric from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the corporate limits of the city. The first payment hereunder shall be due and payable on or before March 15, 2001, and shall be based upon TXU Electric's said gross receipts during the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31 for the rights and privileges granted hereunder during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2001. The second payment hereunder shall be due and payable on or before March 15, 2002, and shall be based on TXU Electric's said gross receipts during the 12-month period ending preceding December 31, 2001, and shall be payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2002. 
(b)  Beginning on January 1, 2002, a charge, as authorized by Section 33.008(b) of PURA, based on each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by TXU Electric to each retail customer whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within the city's municipal boundaries. The charge imposed shall be equal to the total electric franchise fee revenue due the city from TXU for calendar year 1998 divided by the total kilowatt hours delivered during 1998 by TXU to retail customers whose consuming facilities' points of delivery were located within the city's boundaries. The franchise fee that TXU shall pay to the city shall be equal to the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998 multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours delivered by TXU within the city's boundaries during the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31 for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the year in which payment is made. The first payment hereunder shall be due and payable on or before March 15, 2003 for the rights and privileges granted hereunder during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003. Subsequent payments hereunder shall be due and payable annually thereafter on or before March 15 of each succeeding year during the term hereof, and shall be based on the charge per kilowatt hour determined for 1998 multiplied times the number of kilowatt hours delivered by TXU within the city's boundaries during the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31 for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the year in which payment is made. Each such payment shall be accompanied with a report showing the kilowatt hours delivered for the said preceding 12-month period upon which the payment is based. 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 6(a) hereof, if TXU Electric files general rate cases and the city incurs cumulative expenses, otherwise reimbursable by TXU Electric under Section 33.023 of PURA, as amended, or similar or successor law, in excess of $4,000,000.00, then in such event, TXU Electric shall reimburse all of the expenses incurred by the city in connection with all general rate cases filed during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 2008, in excess of said $4,000,000.00. The term "general rate case" as used in this ordinance means a rate case initiated by TXU Electric in which it seeks to increase its rates charged to a substantial number of its customer classes in the city and elsewhere in its system and in which TXU Electric's overall revenues are determined in setting such rates. The city agrees to exercise reasonable best efforts, considering the facts and circumstances, to keep its expenses on average to under $1,000,000.00 per general rate case. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6(a) and 6(c) hereof, in the event that the largest city, by population, served by TXU Electric incurs cumulative expenses in connection with general rate cases filed by TXU Electric during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 2008, in excess of $4,000,000.00 and TXU Electric reimburses said city such excess, then, in that event, TXU Electric will reimburse the city its reasonable expenses actually incurred that are otherwise reimbursable under Section 33.023 of PURA, as amended, limited, however, to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: 
A = [(B - $4,000,000.00) ° B] × C, where: A = The amount reimbursable to the city under this franchise; B = The total amount of expenses incurred by the largest city, by population, served by TXU Electric during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 2008, in connection with general rate cases filed by TXU Electric, which expenses would be reimbursable under Section 33.023 of PURA, except for the terms of said city's franchise, but excluding all such expenses incurred in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Docket Nos. 9300 and 11735; and C = The total amount of expenses incurred by the city during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 2008, in connection with general rate cases filed by TXU Electric, which expenses would be reimbursable under Section 33.023 of PURA, except for the terms of this franchise, but excluding all such expenses incurred in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Dockets Nos. 9300 and 11735.  
    SECTION 7. This ordinance shall become effective upon TXU Electric's written acceptance hereof, said written acceptance to be filed by TXU Electric with the city within 30 days after final passage and approval hereof, and the right, privilege and franchise granted hereby shall continue thereafter for a term expiring on December 31, 2025. 
    SECTION 8. This ordinance shall be cumulative of any and all other permits and franchises granted by the city to TXU Electric; provided, however, that all ordinances or parts of ordinances that conflict herewith are hereby repealed upon the effective date [November 28, 2000,] of this ordinance. 
    SECTION 9. In order to accept this franchise, the company must file with the city secretary its written acceptance of this franchise ordinance within 30 days after its final passage and approval by the city. If written acceptance of this franchise ordinance is not filed by the company after its final passage and approval by said city, the franchise ordinance shall be rendered null and void.

Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the City, that Grantee believes is in violation of any federal, state, or local law or regulation.

City shall provide reasonable notice to Grantee of the deadline for Grantee to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to City. In the event that the City makes application for and receives such reimbursement and does not provide sufficient notice to Grantee as set forth in this paragraph, the City shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the removal or relocation of Grantee's facilities. When Grantee is required to remove or relocate any System facility without reimbursement, Grantee shall have the right to seek recovery of relocation costs as provided for in applicable state and/or federal law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit, alter, or modify in any way the right of Grantee to seek or recover a surcharge from customers for the cost of relocation pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law. City shall not oppose recovery of relocation costs when Grantee is required by City to perform relocation. City shall not require that Grantee document request for reimbursement as a pre-condition to recovery of such relocation costs. This paragraph applies exclusively to the Grantee's recovery of its relocation costs and, except as provided in this Section 7(E), nothing herein shall prohibit the City from denying or opposing a request by Grantee to increase or modify its other rates, charges, fees or tariffs. 
(F)  City may request Grantee to relocate any part of its System facilities installed or maintained in the Public Right-of-Way to accommodate construction or improvement of a highway, road, street, public way or other public work procured by City which is not undertaken primarily for beautification or solely to accommodate a private developer. Grantee shall be responsible for bearing the costs of such relocation to the extent that proposed City facilities are determined to be in conflict with Grantee's existing facilities and as permitted by local, state or federal law. Such relocation shall be made within a reasonable period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days after notice of request from City unless otherwise specifically agreed to by the City. Should Grantee submit evidence that it is unable to complete the relocation within said time due to no fault of Grantee, the City Manager may agree with Grantee to extend such time.

The Grantee agrees to cooperate fully with the City in conducting the inspection. Such inspections shall be conducted within a reasonable time after completion of the project. The Grantee shall promptly perform reasonable remedial action required by the City pursuant to such an inspection. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the authority to regulate and inspect the Grantee's system for compliance with the provisions of Part 192 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby reserved to those federal and state authorities having jurisdiction thereunder and nothing herein is intended to confer any such authority to City unless expressly provided under applicable law. 
(I)  The City reserves the right to lay and permit to be laid, power, sewer, Gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do and permit to be done, any underground and overhead work that may be deemed necessary or proper by the City in, across, along, over and under any Public Right-of-Way occupied by Grantee, and to change any curb or sidewalk or the grade of any street. 
(J)  If City abandons any Public Rights-of-Way in which Grantee has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Grantee's right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Grantee for all removal or relocation expenses if Grantee agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests Grantee to remove or relocate its facilities and Grantee agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
Section 4. - Indemnification and insurance. 
(A)  In consideration of the granting of this franchise, Grantee agrees to indemnify and keep harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from and against all suits, actions, liability, or claims of injury to any person or persons, or damages to any property brought or made for or on account of any death, injuries to, or damages received or sustained by any person or persons or for damage to or loss of property arising out of, or occasioned by grantee's intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions in connection with Grantee's operations; this indemnification shall apply whether or not the City, its agents, officers or employees were negligent. 
(B)  It is the intent of the parties by agreement to this Section 4 that if a claim is made in any forum against Indemnitees for any of the reasons referred to in Section 4(A), and upon resolution of the claim: 
(1)  There is no finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that Indemnitees were negligent in connection with any of the reasons referred to in Section 4(A), Grantee shall hold Indemnitees harmless and indemnify them for any damage, loss, expense, or liability resulting from the claim, including all reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and penalties incurred; or 
(2)  There is a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that Grantee and Indemnitee were both negligent in connection with any of the reasons referred to in Section 4, Indemnity, if any, shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. 
(C)  This section does not waive any governmental immunity available to the City under Texas law. This section is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the Grantee and the City. This section is not intended to limit the ability of City or Grantee to settle claims through alternative dispute resolution. 
(D)  If any action, suit or proceeding is brought against the City, its agents and employees, upon any claim arising out of Grantee's operations, City shall give notice in writing to Grantee by registered or certified mail. The City agrees to reasonably cooperate with Grantee in connection with such defense. 
(E)  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of any claim or notice of the commencement of any action, administrative or legal proceeding, or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in Section 4(A) hereof may apply, the Indemnitee shall notify the Grantee in writing of such fact. Grantee shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by Grantee and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. 
(F)  Should an Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification under this Section 4 hereof as a result of a claim by a third party, and Grantee fails to assume the defense of such claim, the Indemnitee will, at the expense of Grantee, contest (or, with the prior written consent of Grantee, settle) such third party claim.

(2)  Attempt to evade any provision of the Franchise or to practice any fraud or deceit upon the City or its Residents;

(4)  Failure to provide the services set forth in the Franchise; or 
(5)  Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the Franchise.

(D)  If Grantee does not cure the default within such time frame, City shall notify Grantee in writing of its right to have a hearing before the City Council to present any objections or defenses Grantee may have that are relevant to the proposed termination. The notice shall specify a hearing date which shall be at least thirty (30) days from the date of the notice. After such hearing, the City may determine whether to continue or to terminate the franchise. The final decision of the City Council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Upon timely appeal by Grantee of the City Council's decision terminating the franchise, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or a court order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable, and until the termination becomes effective, the provisions of this franchise shall remain in effect for all purposes. 
(E)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and remedies of City set forth in this section shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity.

Upon approval, the rights, privileges, and franchise herein granted to the Grantee shall extend to and include its successors and assigns. The assignment shall not become effective until assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements and agreements contained in this franchise.
