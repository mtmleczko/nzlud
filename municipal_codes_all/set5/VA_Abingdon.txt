PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the 
Town of Abingdon, Virginia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and 
ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the 
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the 
section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative 
tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as 
supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Ronald 
K. McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given 
to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. G. M. Newman, Town Manager, Mr. Jack Hemmings, Town 
Attorney, and Mrs. Linda Wilson, Deputy Town Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the 
progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have 
resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all 
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Code Corporation, consisting of Chapters 1 through 82, and appendixes A and B, each inclusive, is 
adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before January 9, 1995, 
and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed.

licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have 
been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent 
nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general 
and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be 
able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Printed herein is Acts 1978, ch. 76, as adopted by the General Assembly. Amendments 
to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of 
a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious 
misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, 
catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by 
brackets. 


CHAPTER 1. - INCORPORATION, FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND BOUNDARIES 


Sec. 1.1. - Incorporation.

and an order of the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia, contracting the corporate limits of the 
Town of Abingdon as entered on November 22, 1950, in Law Order Book 27, page 24, which are 
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

    The Town of Abingdon shall have and may exercise all powers which are now or hereafter may be 
conferred upon or delegated to towns under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
as fully and completely as though such powers were specifically enumerated herein, and no enumeration 
of particular powers by this Charter shall be held to be exclusive, and the town shall have, exercise, and 
enjoy all the rights, immunities, powers and privileges and be subject to all the duties and obligations now 
appertaining to and incumbent on the town as a municipal corporation. 


Sec. 2.2. - Adoption of certain sections of the Code of Virginia. 
    The powers granted in section 2.1 of this Charter include specifically, but are not limited to, all

furtherance thereof and supplemental thereto. 


Sec. 2.3. - Eminent domain. 
    The powers of eminent domain as set forth in Code of Virginia, Title 15.1 and Title 25, as amended, 
are hereby conferred upon the Town of Abingdon. 


CHAPTER 3. - COUNCIL 


Sec. 3.1. - Election, qualification and term of office for councilmen. 
    The Town of Abingdon shall be governed by a town council composed of five councilmen, all of 
whom shall be qualified voters of the town, to be elected from the town at large. Any person qualified to 
vote in the town shall be eligible for the office of councilman. The councilmen in office at the time of the 
adoption of this Charter shall continue in office until the expiration of the terms for which they were 
elected or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. An election for councilmen shall be held 
on the first Tuesday in May, 1978, and on the first Tuesday in May of every second year thereafter. The 
councilmen elected the first Tuesday in May, 1978, and thereafter shall enter upon their duties on the first 
day of July next succeeding their election, and shall each serve for a term of four years or until their 
successors have qualified. 


Sec. 3.2. - Vacancies on council. 
    Vacancies on the council shall be filled promptly from among the qualified voters of the town, by a 
majority vote of the remaining members of the council. 
Editor's note— Code of Virginia, § 15.1-830, provides the procedure for filling vacancies. 


Sec. 3.3. - Council a continuing body. 
    The council shall be a continuing body, and no measures pending before such body, or contract or

Sec. 3.4. - Mayor. 
    At its first meeting, the council shall choose by a majority vote of all the members thereof one of their 
number to be mayor and one to be vice-mayor for the ensuing two years. The mayor shall preside over 
the meetings of the council, have the same right to speak therein as other members and shall have a vote 
but no veto. He shall be recognized as the head of the town government for all ceremonial purposes, the 
purposes of military law, and the service of civil process, and shall authenticate by his signature, such 
documents or instruments as the council, this Charter, or the laws of the Commonwealth shall require. 
The vice-mayor shall in the absence or disability of the mayor perform the duties of the mayor. In the 
absence or disability of both mayor and vice-mayor the council shall, by majority vote of those present 
choose one of their number as acting mayor. 


Sec. 3.5. - Vacancy in office of mayor. 
    A vacancy in the office of mayor shall be filled promptly for the unexpired portion of the term from 
among the members of council, by a majority vote of the council. 


Sec. 3.6. - Meetings of council. 
    The council shall fix the time of its stated meetings and it shall meet at least once a month and, 
except as herein provided, the council shall establish its own rules of procedure and such rules as are 
necessary for the orderly conduct of its business not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. A journal shall be kept of its official proceedings, and its meetings shall be open to the public. 
Three members of the council shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting.

Sec. 2-176. - Purpose. 
(a) ?The purpose of this article is to enunciate the public policies of this town pertaining to governmental 
procurement from nongovernment sources. 
(b) ?The provisions of this article shall not apply to those contracts entered into prior to January 1, 1983, 
which shall continue to be governed by the laws in effect at the time those contracts were executed. 
(c) ?To the end that this town obtains high quality goods and services at reasonable costs, that all 
procurement procedures be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any 
impropriety or appearance of impropriety, that all qualified vendors have access to public business 
and that no offeror be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded, it is the intent of the council that 
competition be sought to the maximum feasible degree, that the town enjoy broad flexibility in 
fashioning details of such competition, that the rules governing contract awards be made clear in 
advance of the competition, that specifications reflect the procurement needs of the town rather than 
being drawn to favor a particular vendor, and that the town and vendor freely exchange information 
concerning what is sought to be procured and what is offered.

Sec. 2-177. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Competitive negotiation means a method of contractor selection which includes the following 
elements: 
(1) ?Issuance of a written request for proposal indicating in general terms that which is sought to be 
procured, specifying the factors which will be used in evaluating the proposal and containing or 
incorporating by reference the other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any 
unique capabilities or qualifications which will be required of the contractor. 
(2) ?Public notice of the request for proposal at least ten days prior to the date set for receipt of 
proposals by posting in a public place normally used for posting of public notices and by 
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area which the contract is to be 
performed so as to provide reasonable notice to the maximum number of offerors that can be 
reasonably expected to submit proposals in response to the particular request. In addition, 
proposals may be solicited directly from potential contractors. 
(3) ?a.  
Procurement of professional services. The public body shall engage in individual discussions 
with two or more offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial 
responses and with emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. 
Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. The offerors shall be encouraged to 
elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the 
proposed project, as well as alternative concepts. The request for proposal shall not, however, 
request that the offerors furnish estimates of manhours or cost for services. At the discussion 
stage, the town may discuss nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including, but not 
limited to, life-cycle costing and where appropriate, nonbinding estimates of price for services. 
Proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to 
competitors. At the conclusion of discussion, outlined in this provision, on the basis of 
evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the 
selection process to this point, the town shall select in the order of preference two or more 
offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. 
Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract 
satisfactory and advantageous to the town can be negotiated at a price considered fair and 
reasonable, the award shall be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations with the offeror 
ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked 
second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. Should 
the town determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or 
that one officer is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, 
a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. 
Multiphase professional services contracts satisfactory and advantageous to the state department of 
transportation for environmental, location, design and inspection work regarding highways and bridges 
may be negotiated and awarded based on a fair and reasonable price for the first phase only, when 
completion of the earlier phases is necessary to provide information critical to the negotiation of a fair and 
reasonable price for succeeding phases. 
b. ?Procurement of other than professional services. Selection shall be made of two or more 
offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on 
the basis of the factors involved in the request for proposal, including price if so stated in 
the request for proposal. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so 
selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor. After 
negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the town shall select the 
offeror which, in its opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to 
that offeror. Should the town determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one 
offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified than the others 
under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. 
    Competitive sealed bidding means a method of contractor selection which includes the following 
elements: 
(1) ?Issuance of a written invitation to bid containing or incorporating by reference the specifications 
and contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Unless the town has 
provided for prequalification of bidders, the invitation to bid shall include a statement of any 
requisite qualifications of potential contractors. When it is impractical to prepare initially a 
purchase description to support an award based on prices, an invitation to bid may be issued 
requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation to bid limited to 
those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(2) ?Public notice of the invitation to bid at least ten days prior to the date set for the receipt of bids 
by posting in a designated public area, or publication in a newspaper of general circulation, or 
both. In addition, bids may be solicited directly from potential contractors. Any additional 
solicitation shall include businesses selected from a list made available by the state department 
of minority business enterprise. 
(3) ?Public opening and announcement of all bids received. 
(4) ?Evaluation of bids based upon the requirements set forth in the invitation, which may include 
special qualifications of potential contractors, life-cycle costing, value analysis, and any other 
criteria such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery and suitability for a particular 
purpose, which are helpful in determining acceptability. 
(5) ?Award to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. When the terms and conditions of 
responsible bids are so provided in the invitation to bid, awards may be made to more than one 
bidder. 
(6) ?Competitive sealed bidding shall not be required for the procurement of professional services. 
    Construction means building, altering, repairing, improving, or demolishing any structure, building or 
highway, and any draining, dredging, excavation, grading or similar work upon real property. 
    Construction management contract means a contract in which a party is retained by the owner to 
coordinate and administer contracts for construction services for the benefit of the owner, and may also 
include, if provided in the contract, the furnishing of construction services to the owner. 
    Design-build contract means a contract between the town and another party in which the party 
contracting with the town agrees to both design and build the structure, roadway or other item specified in 
the contract. 
    Goods means all material, equipment, supplies, printing and automated data processing hardware 
and software. 
    Informality means a minor defect or variation of a bid or proposal from the exact requirements of the 
invitation to bid, or the request for proposal, which does not affect the price, quality, quantity or delivery 
schedule for the goods, services or construction being procured. 
    Multiphase professional services contract means a contract for the providing of professional services 
where the total scope of work of the second or subsequent phase of the contract cannot be specified 
without the results of the first or prior phase of the contract. 
    Nonprofessional services means any services not specifically identified as professional services in 
the definition of "professional services." 
    Potential bidder or offeror, for the purposes of sections 2-229 and 2-233, means a person who, at the 
time the town negotiates and awards or proposes to award a contract, is engaged in the sale or lease of 
goods, or the sale of services, insurance or construction, of the type to be procured under such contract, 
and who at such time is eligible and qualified in all respects to perform that contract, and who would have 
been eligible and qualified to submit a bid or proposal had the contract been procured through 
competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation. 
    Professional services means work performed by an independent contractor within the scope of the 
practice of accounting, actuarial services, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, law, 
medicine, optometry, pharmacy or professional engineering. 
    Responsible bidder or offeror means a person who has the capability, in all respects, to perform fully 
the contract requirements and the moral and business integrity and reliability which will assure good faith 
performance and who has been prequalified, if required. 
    Services means any work performed by an independent contractor wherein the service rendered 
does not consist primarily of acquisition of equipment or materials, or the rental of equipment, materials 
and supplies. 
    Sheltered workshop means a work-oriented rehabilitative facility with a controlled working 
environment and individual goals which utilize work experience and related services for assisting the 
handicapped person to progress toward normal living and a productive vocational status.

public highways, may withdraw his bid from consideration if the price bid was substantially lower than 
the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the 
mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an 
unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material 
made directly in the compilation of a bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional 
omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, 
documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. One of the 
following procedures for withdrawal of a bid shall be selected by the council and stated in the 
advertisement for bids: 
(1) ?The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid within two 
business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure and shall submit original work 
papers with such notice; or

and materials used in the preparation of the bid within one day after the date fixed for 
submission of bids. 
The work papers shall be delivered by the bidder in person or by registered mail at or prior to the time 
fixed for the opening of bids. In either instance, such work papers, documents and materials may be 
considered as trade secrets or proprietary information subject to the conditions of Code of Virginia, § 11-
52D. The bids shall be opened one day following the time fixed by the town for the submission of bids. 
Thereafter, the bidder shall have two hours after the opening of bids within which to claim in writing any 
mistake as defined herein and withdraw his bid. The contract shall not be awarded by the town until the 
two-hour period has elapsed. Such mistake shall be proved only from the original work papers, 
documents and materials delivered as required herein. 
(b) ?The council may establish procedures for the withdrawal of bids for other than construction 
contracts. 
(c) ?No bid may be withdrawn under this section when the result would be the awarding of the contract 
on another bid of the same bidder or of another bidder in which the ownership of the withdrawing 
bidder is more than five percent. 
(d) ?If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this section, the lowest remaining bid shall be deemed to 
be the low bid. 
(e) ?No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid shall, for compensation, supply any material or labor to 
or perform any subcontract or other work agreement for the person to whom the contract is awarded 
or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project for which the 
withdrawn bid was submitted. 
(f) ?If the council denies the withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of this section, it shall notify the 
bidder in writing stating the reasons for its decision and award the contract to such bidder at the bid 
price, provided such bidder is a responsible and responsive bidder.

expire ten days after those records are available for inspection by such bidder or offeror under 
section 2-204, or at such later time as provided in this section. No protest shall lie for a claim that the

basis for the protest and the relief sought. The council or designated official shall issue a decision in 
writing within ten days stating the reasons for the action taken. The decision shall be final unless the

relief shall be a finding to that effect. The council shall cancel the proposed award or revise it to 
comply with the law. If, after an award, it is determined that an award of a contract was arbitrary or 
capricious, then the sole relief shall be as hereinafter provided. Where the award has been made but 
performance has not begun, the performance of the contract may be enjoined. Where award has

or at least 80 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each 
corporation; and

course of dealing for 30 consecutive days or more. A definite place of business for a person engaged in 
business may include a location leased or otherwise obtained from another person on a temporary or 
seasonal basis, and real property leased to another. A person's residence shall be deemed to be a 
definite place of business if there is no definite place of business maintained elsewhere and the person is

as part of a regular business. 
    Security, for purposes of this article, shall have the same meaning as in the Securities Act

hours, but at that place offers to sell goods, wares, and merchandise, is a peddler. Any person who 
keeps a regular place of business, with regular business hours at the same place, who other than at 
that regular place of business, personally or through agents, offers for sale or sells and, at the time of 
such offering for sale, delivers goods, wares and merchandise is a peddler. 
    Itinerant merchant means any person who engages in, does or transacts any temporary or 
transient business in the state, either in one locality or in traveling from place to place in the sale of 
goods, wares and merchandise, and who for that purpose of carrying on such business hires, leases, 
uses or occupies any building or structure, motor vehicle, tent, car, boat or public room or any part 
thereof, including rooms in hotels, lodging houses, or houses of private entertainment, or in any 
street, alley, or public place in any city or town, or in any public road in any county, for a period of 
less than one year, for the exhibition of or sale of such goods, wares, or merchandise. 
(1) ?A charitable institution or other not-for-profit organization that engages in the business of 
buying and selling merchandise may be subject to a local license tax as a retail or wholesale 
merchant, even though the proceeds are subsequently used for charitable purposes. 
(2) ?A lunch counter operated by an organization open to members only, the proceeds from which 
are used to maintain the organization, may be subject to a local license tax. 
(3) ?Any hotel, motel, boardinghouse, or lodging house which also furnishes or sells food or 
merchandise for compensation is engaged in retail sales as to the sales of the food or 
merchandise. 
(4) ?A person is not subject to local license tax if his business in this state is limited solely to the 
solicitation of orders by catalogs mailed from outside this state to mail-order buyers in this state 
and who fills orders from outside this state; however, if the catalogs are distributed by a state 
resident by mail or in person or if the person engaged in the mail-order business has a definite 
place of business in this state at which mail orders are received or filled, the mail order business 
may be treated the same as any other retail or wholesale business for purposes of local license 
taxes. 
(5) ?Any person who merely fills prescriptions for or fits corrective lenses and eyeglass frames is a 
retail merchant; however, any practitioner who examines eyes is engaged in rendering a 
professional service. 
(6) ?Any practitioner of a profession who sells goods, wares, or merchandise in connection with the 
practice of the profession may be engaged in making retail sales depending on the nature of the 
products sold and the service performed. Examples in this area are as follows: 
a. ?A medical doctor who engages in the sale of drugs or other goods, wares or merchandise 
as well as the practice of medicine is a merchant as to those sales; however, a medical 
doctor is not a merchant as to the drugs used in giving an immunization to a patient. 
b. ?A chiropodist who sells shoes in connection with his practice is a retail merchant as to such 
sales. 
(7) ?A job printer is a manufacturer and is engaged in either retail or wholesale sales as to the sales 
of the items printed. 
(8) ?The sales price alone is not determinative of whether the sale is at retail or wholesale. The fact 
that a person sells goods, wares or merchandise at wholesale prices, at cost, or at less than 
cost does not prevent the person from being classified as a retail merchant if the sales fall within 
he definition of a retail sale. 
(9) ?Any person who purchases rough stone already cut and who then polishes, glazes and cuts 
lettering in the stone is not a manufacturer and is engaged in either retail or wholesale sales. 
(10) ?Any person who sells goods at retail through a commission merchant may be held liable for a 
local license tax as to such sales. 
    Services means things purchased by a customer which do not have physical characteristics, or 
which are not goods, wares, or merchandise. 
    Wholesaler or wholesale merchant means any person or merchant who sells wares and 
merchandise for resale by the purchaser, including sales when the goods, wares and merchandise will be 
incorporated into goods and services for sale, and also includes sales to institutional, commercial, 
government and industrial users which, because of the quantity, price, or other terms, indicate that they 
are consistent with sales at wholesale. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 2) 


Sec. 18-28. - License required. 
(a) ?[Conditions for application; separate licenses.] 
(1) ?Every person engaging [with]in the town in any business, trade, profession, occupation or 
calling (collectively hereinafter "a business") as defined in this article, unless otherwise 
exempted by law, shall apply for a license for each such business if: 
a. ?Such person maintains a definite place of business within the town; 
b. ?Such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does maintain an abode in 
the town, which abode, for the purposes of this article, shall be deemed a definite place of 
business; or 
c. ?There is no definite place of business but such person operates amusement machines; is 
engaged as a peddler or itinerant merchant, carnival or circus as specified in Code of 
Virginia, §§ 58.1-3717, 58.1-3718, or 58.1-3728, respectively; or is a contractor subject to 
Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715; or is a public service corporation subject to Code of Virginia, 
§ 58.1-3731. 
(2) ?A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business. A person engaged in 
two or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to 
obtain one license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are 
satisfied: 
a. ?Each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any 
requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of the town; 
b. ?All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to 
different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the 
highest rate; and 
c. ?The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the town manager may require 
concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts. 
(3) ?Exclusions [to this subsection are as follows:] 
a. ?No license tax shall be imposed upon or collected from any person for selling farm or 
domestic or nursery products, ornamental or otherwise, or for the planting of nursery 
products as an incident to the sale thereof, provided such products are grown or produced 
by such person. 
b. ?No license tax shall be required for the privilege or right of printing or publishing any 
newspaper or for the privilege or right of operating or conducting any radio or television 
broadcasting station. 
c. ?No license tax shall be required for the business of renting, as the owner of such property, 
real property, other than hotels, motels, motor lodges, auto courts, tourist courts, trailer 
parks, lodging houses, rooming houses, and boardinghouses. 
d. ?No license tax shall be required for the manufacturing and selling of goods, wares, or 
merchandise at the place of manufacture. 
(b) ?Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business, if he was 
not subject to licensing in the town on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 
1 of the current license year if he had been issued a license for the preceding license year. The 
application shall be on forms prescribed by the town manager. 
    Every application for a license shall have incorporated therein or annexed thereto the affidavit of the 
applicant to the effect that the statements contained in the application are true. If the applicant be [is] an 
individual, the affidavit must be made by him, if by one of the members and, if a corporation, by the officer 
having knowledge of the correctness of the statements made in the application. 
(c) ?The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If 
the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before March 1 
of each calendar year. 
(d) ?The town manager may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to file an 
application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely 
payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at 
the end of the extension, together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the 
estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a 
penalty of ten percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(e) ?A penalty of ten percent of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the 
failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the 
town manager if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be 
assessed if the town manager determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the 
case of an assessment of additional tax made by the town manager, if the application and, if 
applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any 
fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment 
penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the town manager is not paid 
within 30 days, the town manager may impose a ten-percent late payment penalty. The penalties 
shall not be imposed or, if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them, if the failure 
to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer 
must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
(1) ?"Acted responsibly" means that: 
a. ?The taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise 
under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business; and 
b. ?The taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting 
appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable 
impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a 
failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
(2) ?"Events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of 
records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious 
illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's 
reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the town manager, 
who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the 
erroneous information. 
(f) ?Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid without 
regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or 
omitted tax by the town manager is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and 
collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded, together with 
interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be 
paid on the refund of any tax paid under this article from the date of payment or due date, whichever 
is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be 
paid at the same rate charged under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3916. 
    No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion 
of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, in event of such 
adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than 30 days from the date of the 
payment that created the refund, or the due date of the tax, whichever is later. 
(g) ?Any person who knowingly falsifies gross receipts or other material fact to obtain a license as 
required herein for an amount less than that which should be paid hereunder shall be guilty of a 
class 1 misdemeanor. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. 
(h) ?As one of the means of ascertaining the amount of any license tax, the town manager may 
propound interrogatories to each applicant and use such other evidence as he may procure. Such 
interrogatories shall be answered under oath, and any applicant refusing to answer such 
interrogatories under oath shall be fined not less than $50.00 nor more than $100.00 for each 
offense. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 3) 


Sec. 18-29. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a) ?General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by gross receipts, the gross 
receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise 
of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within the town. In the case of activities 
conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the 
gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are 
initiated, directed, or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business 
shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1) ?The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which 
his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of 
business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, 
unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2) ?The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of 
business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur 
at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales 
solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house 
subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the 
definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and 
merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or 
more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different 
measures may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure 
of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3) ?The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the 
definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented, or if the property 
is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the 
rental of such property is managed. 
(4) ?The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of 
business at which the services are performed, or if not performed at any definite place of 
business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b) ?Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or 
impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under 
the general rule (and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement), 
except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts of the 
business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. 
Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under 
the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. 
Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be 
attributed to the town solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross 
receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c) ?Agreements. The town manager may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of 
the state concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places 
of business; however, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed 
the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. 
Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally 
inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to 
engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 
percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the town manager shall 
make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions 
involved. When localities cannot reach an agreement over how gross receipts from a given business 
should be apportioned among them, the taxpayer or assessing official may seek an advisory opinion 
from the department of taxation. In cases where the taxpayer is able to demonstrate to a court that 
double assessment has occurred, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the 
litigation as are necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 4) 


Sec. 18-30. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a) ?Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed 
pursuant to this article, both the town manager and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its 
assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period 
agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing 
made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b) ?Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the town manager shall assess the local license tax 
omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six 
preceding years (this applies to only 1997 and later; prior to 1997 is current plus three preceding 
years). 
(c) ?The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of 
Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been 
extended pursuant to this subsection, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which 
collection has been stayed pursuant to subsections 18-31(b) or 18-31(d) of this article, or two years 
after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984, or similar law 
for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 5) 


Sec. 18-31. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a) ?Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this article as the result of an audit may apply within 
90 days from the date of the assessment to the town manager for a correction of the assessment. 
The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period, remedy 
sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any 
other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The town manager may hold a conference with the 
taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and 
documents, further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable 
determination of the applications. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The town 
manager shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the 
taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a 
written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be 
followed in the town (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b) ?Provided an application is made within 90 days of an assessment, collection activity shall be 
suspended until a final determination is issued by the town manager, unless the town manager 
determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a 
request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the 
provisions of subsection 18-28(f) of this article, but no further penalty shall be imposed while 
collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the 
application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to: 
(1) ?Depart quickly from the locality; 
(2) ?Remove his property therefrom; 
(3) ?Conceal himself or his property therein; or 
(4) ?Do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to 
collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c) ?Any person assessed with a license tax under this article as a result of an audit may apply within 90 
days of the determination by the town manager on an application pursuant to subsection 18-31(a) 
above to the tax commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall 
issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless 
the taxpayer and the town manager are notified that a longer period will be required. The application 
shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and the tax 
commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-
1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the town manager may apply to the appropriate 
circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984; however, the burden shall be on the party 
making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax 
commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an 
assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d) ?On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection 18-31(c) 
above, the town manager shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued 
by the tax commissioner, unless the town manager determines that collection would be jeopardized 
by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a 
reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of subsection 18-28(f), but 
no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by 
delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection 18-31(b) above. 
(e) ?Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of the tax to a specific situation 
from the town manager. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for 
the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable 
to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as 
presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be 
revoked or amended prospectively if there is a change in the law [and/or] a court decision, or the 
town manager notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling 
was based; however, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be 
deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect. Anything 
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each person or entity who receives gross receipts from the 
operation of any business, trade, profession, occupation, or calling, as defined in this article, is 
subject to a license tax. Where two or more persons or entities receive gross receipts from the 
operation of any such business, trade, or profession, each such person or entity shall pay a license 
tax in proportion to the share of gross receipts attributable to such person or entity, unless such 
persons have clearly and unequivocally agreed otherwise. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 6) 


Sec. 18-32. - Recordkeeping and audits. 
    Every person who is assessable with a license tax shall keep sufficient records to enable the town 
manager to verify the correctness of the tax paid for the license years assessable and to enable the town 
manager to ascertain what is the correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those years. All 
such records, books of accounts, and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by 
the town manager in order to allow the town manager to establish whether a particular receipt is directly 
attributable to the taxable privilege exercised within the town. The town manager shall provide the 
taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are 
maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside of the town, copies of the appropriate 
books and records shall be sent to the town manager's office upon demand. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 7) 


Sec. 18-33. - Exclusions and deductions from gross receipts. 
(a) ?General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived from 
the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of 
business or profession. 
(b) ?The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts: 
(1) ?Amounts received and paid to the United States, the commonwealth, or any county, city or 
town for the state retail sales or use tax, or for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on 
cigarettes, or for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 
(2) ?Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent 
that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts 
receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the 
creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business). 
(3) ?Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customer. 
(4) ?Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor. 
(5) ?Receipts representing the return of principal or a loan transaction in which the licensee is the 
creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset. 
(6) ?Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate or 
other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a 
person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of 
the sale of goods and services, shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but 
shall be included in the licensee's gross receipts, together with any handling or other fees 
related to the incentive. 
(7) ?Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no 
consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory, 
whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 
(8) ?Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a licensable business not 
classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank 
accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the 
investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the 
licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees and similar income 
attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of 
business. 
(c) ?The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be 
taxable: 
(1) ?Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal 
or state government entity, provided that such property was purchased within two years of the 
sale to such entity by the original purchaser, who shall have been contractually obligated at the 
time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction 
shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the property 
and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible personal 
property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or 
federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation. 
(2) ?Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or foreign country in which the 
taxpayer is liable for an income or other tax based upon income. 
(Ord. of 1-6-97, Art. 8) 


Sec. 18-34. - License fee and taxes. 
    Every person or business subject to licensure under the article shall be assessed and required to 
pay annually such fees and taxes as set out under article 9 of the ordinance from which this article 
derives and as determined from time to time by the town council.

Sec. 30-89. - Regulated land-disturbing activities; submission and approval of plans; contents of plans. 
(a) ?Except as provided herein, no person may engage in any land-disturbing activity until he or she has 
submitted to the department of public works, an erosion and sediment control plan for the land-
disturbing activity, and such plan has been reviewed and approved by the plan-approving authority. 
Where land-disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction of more than one VESCP 
authority, an erosion and sediment control plan, at the option of the applicant, may be submitted to 
the board for review and approval rather than to each jurisdiction concerned. Where the land-
disturbing activity results from the construction of a single-family residence, an agreement in lieu of a 
plan may be substituted for an erosion and sediment control plan if executed by the administrator. 
(b) ?The standards contained within the "Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations", the 
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook as amended are to be used by the applicant when 
making a submittal under the provisions of this ordinance and in the preparation of an erosion and 
sediment control plan. The plan approving authority, in considering the adequacy of a submitted 
plan, shall be guided by the same standards, regulations and guidelines. When the standards vary 
between the publications, the state regulations shall take precedence. 
    Stream restoration and relocation projects that incorporate natural channel design concepts are not 
man-made channels and shall be exempt from any flow rate capacity and velocity requirements for 
natural or man-made channels as defined in any regulations promulgated pursuant to this section, § 62.1-
44.15:54, or 62.1-44.15:65 of the Code of Virginia. 
    Any plan approved prior to July 1, 2014, that provides for stormwater management that addresses 
any flow rate capacity and velocity requirements for natural or man-made channels shall satisfy the flow 
rate capacity and velocity requirements for natural or man-made channels if the practices are designed to 
(i) detain the water quality volume and to release it over 48 hours; (ii) detain and release over a 24-hour 
period the expected rainfall resulting from the one year, 24-hour storm; and (iii) reduce the allowable peak 
flow rate resulting from the 1.5, 2, and 10-year, 24-hour storms to a level that is less than or equal to the 
peak flow rate from the site assuming it was in a good forested condition, achieved through multiplication 
of the forested peak flow rate by a reduction factor that is equal to the runoff volume from the site when it 
was in a good forested condition divided by the runoff volume from the site in its proposed condition, and 
shall be exempt from any flow rate capacity and velocity requirements for natural or man-made channels 
as defined in any regulations promulgated pursuant to § 62.1-44.15:54 or 62.1-44.15:65 of the Code of 
Virginia. For plans approved on and after July 1, 2014, the flow rate capacity and velocity requirements of 
this subsection shall be satisfied by compliance with water quantity requirements in the Stormwater 
Management Act, title 62.1, chapter 3.1, article 2.3 (sec. 62.1-44.15:24 et seq.) of the Code of Virginia 
and attendant regulations, unless such land-disturbing activities are in accordance with 9VAC25-870-48 
of the Virginia Stormwater Management Program (VSMP) permit regulations. 
(c) ?The VESCP authority shall review conservation plans submitted to it and grant written approval 
within 60 days of the receipt of the plan if the administrator determines that the plan meets the 
requirements of the board's regulations and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan 
certifies that he will properly perform the conservation measures included in the plan and will 
conform to the provisions of this article. In addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land-
disturbing activities shown on the approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan 
shall provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, to the administrator, as 
provided by § 62.1-44.15:54, of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law, who will be in 
charge of and responsible for carrying out the land-disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of 
an individual holding a certificate of competence prior to engaging in land-disturbing activities may 
result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person responsible for carrying out the plan 
shall be subject to the penalties provided in this ordinance. However, the administrator may waive 
the certificate of competence requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a 
single-family residence. If a violation occurs during the land-disturbing activity, then the person 
responsible for carrying out the agreement in lieu of a plan shall correct the violation and provide the 
name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, as provided by § 62.1-44.15:52 of the 
Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Law. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a 
certificate of competence shall be a violation of this ordinance. 
(d) ?The plan shall be acted upon within 60 days from receipt thereof by either approving said plan in 
writing or by disapproving said plan in writing and giving specific reasons for its disapproval. When a 
plan is determined to be inadequate, written notice of disapproval stating the specific reasons for 
disapproval shall be communicated to the applicant within 45 days. The notice shall specify the 
modifications, terms and conditions that will permit approval of the plan. If no action is taken by the 
administrator within the time specified above, the plan shall be deemed approved and the person 
authorized to proceed with the proposed activity. The town shall act on any erosion and sediment 
control plan that has been previously disapproved within 45 days after the plan has been revised, 
resubmitted for approval, and deemed adequate. 
(e) ?The administrator may require changes to an approved plan in the following cases: 
(1) ?The inspection reveals that the plan is inadequate to satisfy applicable regulations; or 
(2) ?The person responsible for carrying out the plan finds that because of changed circumstances 
or for other reasons the approved plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed 
amendments to the plan, consistent with the requirements of this ordinance, are agreed to by 
the administrator and the person responsible for carrying out the plans. 
(f) ?Variances: The town may waive or modify any of the standards that are deemed to be too restrictive 
for site conditions, by granting a variance. A variance may be granted under these conditions: 
(1) ?At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the 
approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for 
requesting variances in writing. Specific variances which are allowed by the VESCP authority 
shall be documented in the plan. 
(2) ?During construction, the person responsible for implementing the approved plan may request a 
variance in writing from the administrator. The administrator shall respond in writing either 
approving or disapproving such a request. If the administrator does not approve a variance 
within 10 days of receipt of the request, the request shall be considered to be disapproved. 
Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a variance request with additional 
documentation. 
(g) ?In order to prevent further erosion, the administrator may require approval of a plan for any land 
identified in the local program as an erosion impact area. 
(h) ?When land-disturbing activity will be required of a contractor performing construction work pursuant 
to a construction contract, the preparation, submission, and approval of an erosion and sediment 
control plan shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
(i) ?In accordance with the procedure set forth by § 62.1-44.15:55 (E) of the Code of Virginia, any person 
engaging, in more than one jurisdiction, in the creation and operation of wetland mitigation or stream 
restoration banks, which have been approved and are operated in accordance with applicable 
federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation of wetland 
mitigation or stream restoration banks, pursuant to a mitigation banking instrument signed by the 
Department of Environmental Quality, the Marine Resources Commission, or the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, may, at the option of that person, file general erosion and sediment control specifications 
for wetland mitigation or stream restoration banks annually with the board for review and approval 
consistent with guidelines established by the board. 
(j) ?State agency projects are exempt from the provisions of this article, except as provided for in Code 
of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:56. 
(j) ?A minimum of three copies or an adequate number as specified by the administrator, of the final 
approved erosion and sediment control plan and all supporting data shall be submitted to the 
administrator for project distribution.

certification that the plan will be followed and, upon the development of an online reporting system 
by the department but no later than July 1, 2014, evidence of Virginia Stormwater Management State 
Permit coverage where it is required. 
(b) ?A person shall not conduct any land-disturbing activity until he or she has submitted a permit 
application to the town that includes a state VSMP permit registration statement and, after July 1, 
2014, a stormwater management plan, and has obtained town approval to begin land disturbance. 
(c) ?A plan review and inspection fee in the amounts authorized by the town council from time to time 
shall be paid to the town at the time of submission of the erosion and sediment control plan. 
(d) ?No land-disturbing permit shall be issued until the applicant submits with his application an 
approved erosion and sediment control plan, and certification that the plan will be followed. All 
control measures shall be undertaken at the expense of the owner, or his agent. Pending such actual 
provision thereof, the owner or his agent shall file with the town prior to the issuance of the land-
disturbing permit an agreement and bond with surety in the amount determined by the town in a sum 
equal to the approximate total cost of providing erosion and sedimentation control improvements. 
The bond, as stated below, shall guarantee proper control measures will be properly and 
satisfactorily undertaken and maintained by the permittee. 
(e) ?All applicants, excluding state and federal entities, for permits shall provide to the town a 
performance bond, cash escrow, or an irrevocable letter of credit, any combination thereof, or such 
other legal arrangement acceptable to the town manager, or his designee, to ensure that measures 
could be taken by the town at the applicant's expense should the applicant fail, after proper notice, 
within the time specified to initiate or maintain appropriate conservation measures required of him as 
a result of his land-disturbing activity. Should it be necessary for the town to take such conservation 
action, the town may collect from the applicant any costs in excess of the amount of the surety held. 
Within 60 days of adequate stabilization, as determined by the administrator, or his designee, such 
bond, cash escrow or letter of credit, or other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated 
portion thereof shall be either refunded to the applicant or terminated. These requirements are in 
addition to all other provisions relating to the issuance of permits and are not intended to otherwise 
affect the requirements for such permits.

Sec. 30-91. - Monitoring, reports, and inspections. 
(a) ?The person responsible for carrying out the plan will monitor and maintain the land-disturbing 
activity and will maintain records of these inspections and maintenance to ensure compliance with 
the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in 
controlling erosion and sedimentation. 
(b) ?The department of public works, or its designee, shall periodically inspect the land-disturbing activity 
in accordance with § 9VAC25-840-60 of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations to 
ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the 
plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. The owner, permittee, or person 
responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. The department, the 
town, where authorized to enforce this article, or any duly authorized agent of the department or 
such VESCP authority may, at reasonable times and under reasonable circumstances, enter any 
establishment or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of obtaining information or 
conducting surveys or investigations necessary in the enforcement of the provisions of this 
ordinance. In accordance with a performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any 
combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement, a VESCP authority may also enter any 
establishment or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of initiating or maintaining 
appropriate actions which are required by the permit conditions associated with a land-disturbing 
activity when a permittee, after proper notice, has failed to take acceptable action within the time 
specified. 
    If the administrator, or his designee determines that there is a failure to comply with the plan, notice 
shall be served upon the permittee, or person responsible for carrying out the plan by registered or 
certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or in the plan certification, or by delivery at 
the site of the land-disturbing activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities. The notice 
shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and shall specify the time within which such 
measures shall be completed. Upon failure to comply within the specified time, the permit may be 
revoked and the permittee, certified land disturber, or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be 
deemed to be in violation of this article and, upon conviction, shall be subject to the penalties provided by 
this article. 
(c) ?Upon determination of a violation of this article, the town manager, or his designee, may, in 
conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this article, issue an order 
requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the 
specified corrective measures have been taken. 
    If land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan, the town manager, or his 
designee, may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as provided in this article, issue 
an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any 
required permits are obtained. 
    Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of 
lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where the land-
disturbing activities have commenced without an approved erosion and sediment control plan or any 
required permits, such an order may be issued without regard to whether or not the alleged violator has 
been issued a notice to comply as specified in subsection (b) of this section. Otherwise, such an order 
may be issued only after the alleged violator has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. 
    The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a 
period of seven days from the date of service pending application by the enforcing authority or alleged-
violator for appropriate relief to the circuit court of the county. 
    If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved erosion and sediment control plan or any 
required permits within seven days from the date of service of the order, the town manager or his 
designee may issue an order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other 
than corrective measures, be stopped until an approved erosion and sediment control plan and any 
required permits have been obtained. Such an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or 
certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or the land records of the VESCP authority. 
    The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the circuit court of the county or other appropriate 
court. 
    Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by the town manager 
or his designee may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in the circuit court of the county to obey 
same and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. Upon completion 
and approval of corrective action or obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the order shall 
immediately be lifted. 
    Nothing in this section shall prevent the town manager or his designee from taking any other action 
authorized by this article.

a total of $10,000.00, except that a series of violations arising from the commencement of land-
disturbing activities without an approved plan for any site shall not result in civil penalties which 
exceed a total of $10,000.00. This subsection shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions and shall preclude 
the prosecution of violations as misdemeanors. 
(b) ?The town manager, or his designee, or the owner of property which has sustained damage or which 
is in imminent danger of being damaged, may apply to the county circuit court to enjoin a violation or 
a threatened violation of this article, without the necessity of showing that an adequate remedy at law 
does not exist; however, an owner of property shall not apply for injunctive relief unless (i) he has 
notified in writing the person who has violated the VESCP, and the VESCP authority, that a violation 
of the VESCP has caused, or creates a probability of causing, damage to his property, and (ii) 
neither the person who has violated the VESCP, nor the VESCP authority has taken corrective 
action within 15 days to eliminate the conditions which have caused, or create the probability of 
causing, damage to his property. 
(c) ?In addition to any criminal penalties provided under this article, any person who violates any 
provision of this article may be liable to the town in a civil action for damages. 
(d) ?Without limiting the remedies which may be obtained in this section, any person violating or failing, 
neglecting, or refusing to obey any injunction, mandamus or other remedy obtained pursuant to this 
section shall be subject, in the discretion of the court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000.00 for

expense should he fail, after proper notice, within the time specified to initiate or maintain appropriate

the town takes such action upon such failure by the applicant, the town may collect from the applicant for 
the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security 
held, if any. Within 60 days of the completion of the requirements of the permit conditions, such bond, 
cash escrow, letter of credit or other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated portion thereof, 
shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated.

Property Act (Code of Virginia, § 55-210.1 et seq.). Unclaimed bicycles and mopeds may also be 
disposed of in accordance with section 70-222. Unclaimed firearms may also be disposed of in

public display and sale of unclaimed personal property. Such property, including property selected 
for retention by the police department, shall be described generally in the notice, together with the

become the property of the town and shall be retained only if, in the opinion of the chief of police, 
there is a legitimate use for the property by the agency and that retention of the item is a more 
economical alternative than purchase of a similar or equivalent item. 
(c) ?If no claim has been made by the owner for the property or proceeds of such sale within 60 days of 
the sale, the remaining funds shall be deposited in the general fund of the town and the retained 
property may be placed into use by the police department. Any such owner shall be entitled to apply 
to the town within three years from the date of such sale and, if timely application is made therefor 
and satisfactory proof of ownership of the funds or property is made, the town shall pay the 
remaining proceeds of the sale or return the property to the owner without interest or other charges 
or compensation.

DIVISION 3. - SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FOR LAND PRESERVATION 


Sec. 66-56. - Legislative findings; purpose. 
    The town council finds that the preservation of real estate devoted to agricultural, horticultural, forest 
and open space users within its boundaries is in the public interest and, having heretofore adopted a land 
use plan, hereby declares that such real estate shall be taxed in accordance with the provisions of Code 
of Virginia, § 58.1-3230 et seq., and this article. 
(Code 1985, § 17-23) 


Sec. 66-57. - Application for assessment. 
(a) ?The owner of any real estate meeting the criteria set forth in Code of Virginia, §§ 58.1-3230 and 
58.1-3233, may, at least 60 days preceding the tax year for which such taxation is sought, apply to 
the town manager for the classification, assessment and taxation of such property for the next 
succeeding tax year on the basis of its use, under the procedures set forth in Code of Virginia, § 
58.1-3234; provided, that in any year in which a general reassessment is being made, the property 
owner may submit such application until 30 days have elapsed after his notice of increase in 
assessment is mailed in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3330, or 60 days preceding the tax 
year, whichever is later. Such application shall be on forms provided by the state department of 
taxation and supplied by the town manager and shall include such additional schedules, 
photographs and drawings as may be required by the town manager. An individual who is the owner 
of an undivided interest in a parcel may apply on behalf of himself and the other owners of such 
parcel, upon submitting an affidavit that such other owners are minors or cannot be located. An 
application shall be submitted whenever the use or acreage of such land previously approved 
changes; provided, that such property owner must revalidate annually with the town manager any 
applications previously approved. An application fee of $20.00 plus $0.10 per acre shall accompany 
each application but does not apply to revalidations. There shall be a revalidation fee every sixth 
year. 
(b) ?No application fee may be required when a change in acreage occurs solely as a result of a 
conveyance necessitated by governmental action or condemnation of a portion of any land 
previously approved for taxation on the basis of use assessment. 
(c) ?In any case wherein a landowner has previously submitted such an application, he shall be sent by 
the town manager a form for reapplication 30 days prior to the annual deadline for refiling such 
application, with a letter explaining the aforementioned refiling requirements. 
(d) ?A separate application shall be filed for each noncontiguous tract or boundary owned by the same 
owner, or may be filed on each parcel on the land book.

(a) ?Promptly upon receipt of any initial application, the town manager shall determine whether the 
subject property meets the criteria for taxation under this article. If the town manager determines that 
the subject property does meet such criteria, he shall determine the value of such property for its 
qualifying use, as well as its fair market value. 
(b) ?In determining whether the subject property meets the criteria set forth in this division, the town 
manager may request an opinion from the director of the state department of conservation and 
recreation, the state forester or the state commissioner of agriculture and consumer services. Upon 
the refusal of the commissioner of agriculture and consumer services, the state forester or the 
director of the department of conservation and recreation to issue an opinion or upon an unfavorable 
opinion which does not comport with standards set forth in the statements filed pursuant to Code of 
Virginia, § 58.1-3240, the party aggrieved may seek relief in the circuit court of the county, and if the 
court finds in his favor, it may issue an order which shall serve in lieu of an opinion for the purposes 
of this division. 
(c) ?The use value and fair market value of any qualifying property shall be placed on the land book 
before delivery to the town manager, and the tax for the next succeeding tax year shall be extended 
from the use value.

on the face of such bills, so that the landowner will be apprised of such "fair market value" at all 
times.

interest. 
(a) ?There is hereby imposed a roll-back tax, and interest thereon, in such amounts as may be 
determined under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3237, upon any property as to which the use changes to a 
nonqualifying use or upon any property whose zoning is changed to a more intensive use at the 
request of the owner or his agent. 
(b) ?The owner of any real estate liable for roll-back taxes shall, within 60 days following a change in use 
or zoning, report such change to the town manager or other assessing officer on such forms as may 
be prescribed. The town manager shall forthwith determine and assess the roll-back tax, which shall 
be paid to the town within 30 days of assessment. Upon failure of any owner to report a change in 
use within 60 days following such change in use and/or failure to pay such roll-back tax within 30 
days of assessment, such owner shall be liable for an additional penalty equal to ten percent of the 
amount of the roll-back tax and interest, which penalty shall be collected as a part of the tax. In 
addition to such penalty, there is hereby imposed interest of 0.833 percent of the amount of the roll-
back tax, interest and penalty, for each month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues.

DIVISION 5. - HISTORIC DISTRICT TAX ABATEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Oct. 5, 2009(1), set out provisions intended for use as §§ 66-27—
66-31. At the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as Div. 5, §§ 66-71—66-75. 
Cross reference— OH Old and Historic District, App. B, § 8-1 et seq. 


Sec. 66-71. - Purpose. 
    The Town of Abingdon finds that the continued development and success of its Old and Historic 
District requires incentives, and determines that the most appropriate method of offering incentives for the 
area described below is to create a tax credit/ abatement program in that area, as authorized by the Code 
of Virginia 1950, § 58.1-3220, as amended. The intent of council is to provide property tax credit and/or 
abatements to encourage maintenance, restoration and preservation and rehabilitation by providing for 
such a tax credit of $2,500.00 as to town property taxes for every $2,500.00 of work performed and 
documented on the structures located within the Old and Historic District of the town. The council of the 
town believes that the establishment of such tax credits and/or abatement incentives will improve the 
economic and visual conditions of the geographic area of the town which could, in turn, benefit the 
welfare of the citizens of Abingdon. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1), § 66-27; Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-72. - Administration. 
    The administrator of the Old and Historic District Tax Abatement Incentive shall be the town manager 
or his designee. The administrator shall determine the procedures for obtaining the benefits created by 
this chapter and for the administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1), § 66-28; Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-73. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this division, the phrase below shall have the following meaning, unless clearly 
indicated to the contrary: 
    Qualifying project: The term qualifying project shall mean one that meets the requirements of the 
town council's adopted abatement categories, per section 66-75 below. 
    Qualifying property: The term qualifying property shall mean a structure which is physically located 
within the boundaries of the Old and Historic District, which, by the determination of the administrator, 
positively contributes to the character of said district as a contributing structure or as listed as a state 
and/or National Registered property. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1), § 66-29; Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-74. - Boundaries. 
    Boundaries are those which are shown as being in the Old and Historic District per the Town of 
Abingdon Official Zoning Map. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1), § 66-30; Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-75. - Taxes eligible for exemption/abatement. 
    To encourage maintenance, restoration. preservation and rehabilitation projects, a ten-year 
comprehensive property tax credit for work meeting eligibility criteria would be offered. 
    The program keeps the assessed tax of the renovated structure at the same level as it was before 
the start of renovation for ten years. The ordinance allows a six-month tax abatement, since taxes are 
paid twice per year, for every qualifying $2,500.00 spent and documented on the structure only, not land. 
The credit provided would "roll" and be applied into future tax years, not to exceed ten years, thereby 
making the maximum the property owner could claim $25.000.00 within a ten-year period. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(1), § 66-31; Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-76. - Non-retroactive. 
    Such credit shall be non-retroactive within a ten-year period for a maximum tax credit of $25,000.00. 
The tax credit shall be allowed immediately following the tax year in which the work is completed. 
(Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-77. - Tax credit pre-applicant approval required. 
    The property owner is required to receive a tax credit pre-applicant approval from the board, or 
waiver per town Code, before work begins. To insure compliance, the board shall review all work 
proposed as well as final review/approval upon completion. 
(Ord. of 11-5-12) 


Sec. 66-78. - Issuance of certificate of appropriateness. 
    Upon completion and final approval, the board shall issue a final certificate of appropriateness to be 
reviewed and executed by the town manager or his/her designee and subsequently forwarded to the town 
treasurer for processing.

DIVISION 6. - PARTIAL EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN REHABILITATED, RENOVATED, OR REPLACEMENT 
COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES[5] 

Footnotes:

Editor's note— An ordinance adopted April 2, 2012, effective May 2, 2012, set out provisions intended 
for use as §§ 66-81—66-89. At the editor's discretion, to prevent duplication of section numbers, these 
provisions have been included as §§ 66-80.1—66-80.9. 


Sec. 66-80.1. - Exemption authorized. 
(a) ?Partial tax exemption. A partial tax exemption from real property taxes is hereby provided in 
accordance with the provisions of this subdivision for qualifying real property which is devoted to 
commercial and industrial uses and that is rehabilitated in accordance with the criteria set out in the 
Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, § 58.1-3221 and this section. 
(b) ?Qualification. Real property shall qualify for the partial tax exemption provided for within this 
subdivision when it is located within the geographic boundaries as set forth in this section, it has on it 
a structure that meets the age of structure requirements set forth in this section, and when the 
property has been substantially rehabilitated as set forth in this section. 
(c) ?Geographic boundaries. The geographic boundaries for the partial tax exemption program 
described in Division 6 are the former Johnston Memorial Hospital properties within the Town of 
Abingdon, more specifically described as those properties identified as of September 13, 2011, with 
tax parcel identification numbers as more specifically described in Appendix A, attached hereto. 
(d) ?Age of structure. The age of structure requirement for the partial tax exemption program described 
in this subdivision shall be met if a structure on the commercial or industrial real property shall be no 
less than 20 years old. 
(e) ?Substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation criteria shall be satisfied if a structure 
formerly used for a commercial or industrial purpose but which had fallen into disuse or disrepair has 
been restored, renovated, or rehabilitated in a manner that allows continued commercial or industrial 
use. (The use does not have to be the same type of use as that which occurred in the structure prior 
to the period of disuse or disrepair, but it must be for commercial or industrial use.) As used in this 
section, the term "substantial rehabilitation" shall include demolition and replacement with new 
structure(s) for commercial and industrial use even if such replacement structure is not on the same 
parcel on which the original structure is located, but is, instead, on an adjoining parcel within the 
geographic boundaries defined by this section. In the event that a replacement structure is built on 
an adjoining parcel, then the partial tax exemption credit, if any, shall attach to the parcel on which 
the replacement structure is built and there shall be no eligibility for additional credit for the parcel on 
which the original structure was located.

State Law reference— Partial exemption for certain rehabilitated, renovated or replacement 
commercial or industrial structures authorized, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3221. 


Sec. 66-80.2. - Amount and term of exemption. 
(a) ?Amount of exemption. The amount of exemption authorized pursuant to this section shall be the real 
property tax, as of the effective date of the exemption, on 50 percent of the qualifying costs. 
Qualifying costs shall include the cost of substantial rehabilitation, renovation, or replacement of the 
qualifying commercial or industrial structure, but such partial tax credit shall be limited to the extent 
that it shall not cause reduction of the real property tax below zero dollars. Qualifying costs shall not 
include expenses on the following non-exclusive list of non-qualifying costs: costs for items such as 
office furniture and equipment, desktop office computer systems, manufacturing equipment, rolling 
stock, legal fees, taxes, recording fees, interest, or other expenses unrelated to the construction 
costs necessary for substantial rehabilitation, renovation or replacement of the qualifying structure. 
(b) ?Term of exemption. The partial tax exemption shall be applied for each year of a 15-year period 
following the effective date of exemption, as defined in this division, or such shorter time limitation on 
the length of exemption, as follows. 
(c) ?Shortened term of exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the partial tax exemption shall be 
discontinued when either of the following events occur. 
i. ?The accumulated sum of annually applied credits is $650,000.00; or 
ii. ?The property is conveyed from the owner who was originally approved for receipt of the partial 
tax credit, unless such conveyance is to a business entity related to the original applicant as (1) 
partial or whole owner of such applicant or (2) partially or wholly owned by such applicant. 
(d) ?Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the partial property tax exemption credit provided 
in this subdivision shall be limited to a total maximum collective tax exemption credit of $650,000.00 
for all real property located within the geographic boundaries set forth in this subdivision. In other 
words, no additional partial tax exemption credits shall be awarded after the total of partial tax 
exemptions to be accumulated over the full 15-year period defined in this section will sum 
$650,000.00 for the total land mass included within the geographic boundaries defined in this 
subdivision.

Sec. 66-80.3. - Application; determination of eligibility; application fee. 
(a) ?Application to determine eligibility. As a prerequisite to qualify for partial tax exemption, the owner of 
the structure and of the real property on which the structure is located shall file with the county's 
commissioner of revenue, upon forms furnished by the commissioner, an application to qualify such 
structure for partial tax exemption pursuant to this subdivision. 
(b) ?[Non-qualifying.] A structure shall be deemed non-qualifying if demolition or rehabilitation has 
commenced prior to the commissioner's determination of qualification for the partial tax exemption, 
subject to the following exceptions: 
(1) ?If any property, for which an application for the partial tax exemption credit provided by this 
article is made, has been damaged or destroyed as a result of a sudden natural or manmade 
disaster prior to the application, then that property shall remain eligible for consideration for 
qualification. For purposes of this article, a sudden natural or manmade disaster shall include, 
without limitation, damage or destruction caused by fire, flood, windstorm, and explosion. 
(2) ?If demolition or rehabilitation has commenced no more than six months prior to filing an 
application and the owner provides to the commissioner documentary evidence to prove 
eligibility as set forth in this subdivision, then that property shall remain eligible for consideration 
for qualification. Documentary evidence may include, without limitation, photographs, historical 
records, or other documentary proof of location, age, and prior use of structure. 
(c) ?Determination of percentage eligibility. If a structure qualifies for partial tax exemption pursuant to 
this subdivision in accordance with the geographic boundaries and substantial rehabilitation criteria, 
but in terms of age qualification has some portion that qualifies and some portion that does not 
qualify, then the age of the structure and the amount of partial property tax exemption credit shall be 
determined by the respective square footage of those portions of the substructure of the structure 
being improved that age-qualify in proportion to that the portion that does not age- qualify. In such 
cases, the commissioner shall determine the percentage of such structure, based on square footage, 
that meets the age qualification and include a statement of such percentage determination on the 
commissioner's determination of eligibility, and the commissioner shall apply such percentage 
calculation to the partial exemption credit to determine the proportionate amount of credit that will be 
allowed based on the percentage of age-qualifying portion of the structure. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the commissioner may make a deminimus determination that the percentage of structure 
that does not qualify under the age requirement is such that the deduction from the partial exemption 
credit as a result of such non-qualification shall be waived. This deminimus determination may be 
made if the percentage of non-qualification is equal or less than ten percent of the total square 
footage of such structure. 
(d) ?Expiration of eligibility determination. The commissioner's determination of eligibility shall be 
effective for three years from the date on which it is issued. In other words, once the commissioner 
has determined that an application describes an eligible project, the applicant has three years from 
the date of the commissioner's determination of eligibility to complete the substantial rehabilitation 
project and to submit to the commissioner a copy of a certificate of occupancy for the substantially 
rehabilitated structure and an application to determine the amount of the exemption, as described in 
this subdivision. If, within this three-year period, substantial rehabilitation has not been completed 
and the aforementioned documentation submitted to the commissioner, then to retain such eligibility 
an application to renew the determination must be filed with the commissioner prior to the three year 
eligibility period expiration date. In no event, however, shall there be more than two renewals of 
eligibility following the initial application on any structure. 
(e) ?Initial application. The initial application to qualify for the rehabilitated structure tax exemption and 
any subsequent renewal application must be accompanied by payment of a fee of $50.00 to be paid 
into the general fund of the county, which fee shall be applied to offset the cost of processing such 
application, making the required assessments, and making an annual inspection to determine the 
progress of the work. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-83) 


Sec. 66-80.4. - Effective date of exemption. 
(a) ?Prior to the effective date defined in this section, the owner of the property shall be subject to 
taxation upon the fair market value of the property as determined by the general reassessment prior 
to commencement of rehabilitation. 
(b) ?Upon the commissioner's determination of amount of exemption no later than December 31st of any 
calendar year, the partial tax exemption shall become effective beginning on January 1st of the next 
calendar year, which date shall be the effective date of exemption. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-84) 


Sec. 66-80.5. - Commissioner determination of amount of exemption after completion of substantial 
rehabilitation. 
(a) ?The owner of real property qualifying for partial exemption of real property taxes because of 
substantial rehabilitation of a structure shall submit to the commissioner upon completion of the 
substantial rehabilitation an application to determine amount of exemption credit, and such 
application shall include the following: 
(1) ?Copy of the certificate of occupancy issued by the county; 
(2) ?Owner affidavit of qualifying costs on a form to be provided by the commissioner; and 
(3) ?Affidavit of general contractor or project architect of qualifying costs on a form to be provided 
by the commissioner. 
(b) ?Receipt of application. After receipt of the application to determine the amount of exemption credit, 
the commissioner shall issue to the owner a credit memorandum that states the qualifying costs, as 
certified by the owner, and the amount of partial tax exemption credit pursuant to this subdivision. 
(c) ?Real property tax fluctuations. The partial tax exemption credit to be applied annually for the term of 
the exemption shall be determined based on the real property tax rate on the effective date of the 
exemption, and this credit shall not be amended when the real property tax rate is adjusted from time 
to time. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-85) 


Sec. 66-80.6. - Fluctuations in market value. 
(a) ?Subsequent fair market value increase. In the event that the fair market value of a qualifying 
property increases after the first year of such substantial rehabilitation, renovation or replacement, 
the credit specified by this subdivision shall not be increased. 
(b) ?Subsequent fair market value decrease. In the event that the assessed value of a qualifying 
property decreases after the first year of substantial rehabilitation, renovation or replacement, the 
credit specified in this subdivision shall not be adjusted, with the following exception. It shall be 
capped, for each year of such reduced assessed value, such that the credit shall not reduce the real 
property tax levy on a qualifying structure below zero dollars. If no tax credit or only a reduced tax 
credit can be applied to the qualifying property due to such market value decrease, the unused credit 
shall not be applied to any other property or to real property taxes assessed in any other calendar 
year, and the property's eligibility for the tax exemption shall expire at the end of the 15-year term or 
such shorter term as provided in this subdivision. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-86) 


Sec. 66-80.7. - Miscellaneous. 
(a) ?The credits against the real property tax enabled by this subdivision shall not affect any special 
district taxes or levies within the county. All ad valorem special district taxes or levies shall be 
computed on the full fair market value of all qualifying property. 
(b) ?Methods of evaluation. In determining the fair market value of a structure for purposes of 
assessment of taxes, the commissioner shall employ usual and customary methods of assessing 
real property. 
(c) ?Exemption not applicable to demolition of historic structures. Where substantial rehabilitation is 
achieved through demolition and replacement of an existing structure, the exemption provided in this 
subdivision shall not apply when any structure demolished is a registered state landmark or is 
determined by the state's department of historic resources to contribute to the significance of a 
registered historic landmark. 
(d) ?Condition of the property. Upon application to qualify for partial tax exemption pursuant to this 
subdivision, an applicant shall certify that the property that is the subject of the application, including 
the real property upon which the structure is located, shall be maintained in compliance with all Code 
requirements. Failure to properly maintain the property in compliance with all Code provisions shall 
be grounds for denial of the requested partial tax exemption. 
(e) ?This subdivision shall be applicable to assessments of qualifying commercial or industrial structures 
made on and after January 1, 2012. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-87) 


Sec. 66-80.8. - Limitations on amount and eligibility for partial tax exemption and tax credit. 
(a) ?Tax delinquency at time of application for qualification. No property owner shall be eligible to apply 
for qualification for the partial tax exemption credit provided by this subdivision if the property owner 
or any of its related corporate entities has delinquent taxes, penalties, or interest due the county on 
any of its tax accounts; however, the commissioner of revenue may restore eligibility upon payment 
in full of all such delinquent accounts. 
(b) ?Tax delinquency at time of application for determination of partial tax exemption credit. No property 
owner shall be eligible for the commissioner to make a determination of partial tax exemption credit 
upon completion of substantial rehabilitation of a qualifying real property if such property owner or 
any of its related corporate entities has delinquent taxes, penalties, or interest due the county on any 
of its tax accounts; however, the commissioner of revenue may restore eligibility upon payment in full 
of all such delinquent accounts. 
(Ord. of 4-2-12, § 66-88) 


Sec. 66-80.9. - Failure to pay real property taxes in a timely manner; forfeiture of partial exemptions and 
tax credits, and further qualification limitations. 
(a) ?No tax credit described in this subdivision shall be issued to the owner of any substantially 
rehabilitated, renovated or replaced structure if the real property tax on that property has not been 
timely paid on or before the tax due date of any year as required by county ordinance. Failure to pay 
the real property tax on improved real property in any year on, or before, the date on which the real 
property tax is due shall result in the forfeiture of any partial tax exemption credit that otherwise 
would have been applied to the real property tax due in that year and in any future year. In such 
cases, the property shall be removed from the partial tax exemption program and the annual real 
property tax shall be assessed on the full fair market value of the improved real property. Late 
payment of the real property tax on real property and any substantially rehabilitated, renovated or 
replaced structure thereon shall be subject to late payment penalties and interest in accordance with 
county ordinance. However, the treasurer has statutory discretion to waive penalty and interest and 
is enabled by this ordinance to reinstate the tax exemption credit if the failure to pay the real property 
tax was not in any way the fault of the taxpayer. 
(b) ?Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, no improved property that has qualified for a tax 
credit in accordance with this article by means of substantial rehabilitation shall be eligible to submit 
any application for further tax credits based on subsequent improvements during the pendency of the 
initial tax credit period.

requesting such extension shall bear that portion of the cost of extending such service which 
exceeds the aforementioned connection fee. 
(c) ?As a prerequisite to the commencement of such extension, any customer requesting such extension 
may be required by the town to place on deposit with the town sufficient surety to assure the 
customer's payment of the costs referred to in subsection (b) of this section. The amount of such 
surety required may equal 25 percent of the estimated cost of constructing extensions for individual, 
single-family residential property. The amount of such surety required may equal up to 100 percent 
of the estimated cost of constructing extensions for multiple units of residences or other commercial 
or industrial property. Such estimated costs shall include all labor and material required, including, 
but not limited to, pipe, fittings, manholes, cleanouts, reconstruction or upgrading of existing sewer 
mains to which the proposed extension will be connected, acquisition of necessary easements, and 
the town's appropriate charges for supervision, engineering, insurance, equipment, legal costs and 
accounting. 
(d) ?Up to 75 percent of the requesting customer's share of such extensions to serve individual single-
family residences may be paid by deferred installments which may be arranged with terms and 
conditions to be determined by the town manager. Such installment payments shall be designed to 
recover the town's cost of financing such extension. 
(e) ?To the extent that funds for such purpose are available from sources referred to in subsection (f) of 
this section, customers who have previously borne the cost of such extensions shall be partially 
reimbursed by the town for such expenses on an equitable prorated basis as other customers within 
a five-year period who subsequently tap directly onto such extended lines. In no event shall any 
extending customers be reimbursed more than their share of the actual cost for such extension, nor 
shall any reimbursement be made for customers tapping onto and beginning use of such extended 
sewer service lines after the expiration of ten years from the date of completion of the extension to 
the first customer to request the extension involved. 
(f) ?The town shall collect an appropriate contribution from any customer who subsequently connects to 
such an extended line within a five-year period, the cost of any portion of which extension has 
previously been borne by one or more other customers. Such contribution shall be in addition to 
ordinary tapping fees, and shall be a condition prerequisite to a subsequent customer tapping into 
such an extended line. Funds from such contributions so collected shall be used as the funds from 
which earlier extending customers shall be reimbursed, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. 
The amount of such contribution to be required shall be determined by the town manager as a fair 
share of the total cost of the extension to be tapped, considering the proportion of the total length 
and cost of the extension attributable to the extension up to the intervening property from which the 
proposed connection is to be made. In determining the amount of such contribution, the sewer 
connection fee shall be subtracted from what was determined to be the fair share of such connection 
cost of the total extension. 
(g) ?For all purposes pertaining to this section, extension to a residential subdivision, apartment complex 
or condominium complex shall be deemed to be extension to a single property, and subsequent

compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 74-129 of this division. 
(b) ?The facility manager may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard 
to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial 
user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither 
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from 
intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This 
authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1) ?The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to 
sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not 
regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2) ?The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual 
wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new 
request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual 
wastewater discharge permit. See section 74-128(8). 
(3) ?In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data 
from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at 
the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4) ?The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 74-27, and 
include the certification statement in section 74-129 (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
(5) ?Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not 
present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection 
level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6) ?Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the town manager must be included as a condition in the 
user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in 
its request for the waiver must be maintained by the town manager for three years after 
expiration of the waiver. 
(7) ?Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the town, the 
industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in section 74-171, that there has 
been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user. 
(8) ?In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because 
of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the 
monitoring requirements of section 74-161(a), or other more frequent monitoring requirements 
imposed by the facility manager, and notify the facility manager. 
(9) ?This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in 
categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical 
pretreatment standard. 
(10) ?The town may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports [see section 74-161(a) 
(40 CFR 403.12(e)(1))] to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless 
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the state, where the industrial 
user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
(1) ?500 gallons per day as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless 
the industrial user discharges in batches; 
(2) ?0.5 pounds per day organic load;

(15) ?0.000392 pounds per day zinc. 
Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last two years been in 
significant noncompliance, as defined in section 74-185 of this article. In addition, reduced 
reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant 
levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the town, decreasing the reporting 
requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions 
occurring during the reporting period. 
(d) ?All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and 
flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working 
order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not 
be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(e) ?If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently 
than required by the facility manager, using the procedures prescribed in section 74-167 of this 
division, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(f) ?The town may elect to sample and analyze in lieu of requiring the users to conduct sampling and

Sec. 74-164. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a) ?In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a 
non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause 
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the facility 
manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, 
concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b) ?Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the facility manager, 
submit a detailed written report describing the causes(s) of the discharge and the measures to be 
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of 
any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the 
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification 
relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this 
division. 
(c) ?A notice shall be permanently posted to the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising 
employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a) above. Employers shall 
ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency 
notification procedure.

    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater 
discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with techniques prescribed in 40 
CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and 
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(Ord. of 2-7-11(2)) 


Sec. 74-168. - Sample collection. 
(a) ?Except as indicated in subsection (b) and (c) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 
24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is 
infeasible, the facility manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of 
four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the 
effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 
Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period 
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the 
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, 
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters 
unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be 
authorized by the town, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show 
compliance with the instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b) ?Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic 
chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c) ?For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in 
sections 74-158 and 74-160 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be 
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for 
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data 
are available, the facility manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by 
paragraphs section 74-161 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to 
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable 
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. 
(d) ?All monitoring reports submitted to the POTW that include sampling data are required to include a 
chain-of-custody document. 
(Ord. of 2-7-11(2)) 


Sec. 74-169. - Timing. 
    Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which 
are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt 
of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. of 2-7-11(2)) 


Sec. 74-170. - Recordkeeping. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for 
inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required 
by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities 
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with best 
management practices established under section 74-95. Records shall include the date, exact place, 
method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses 
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results 
of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period 
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the town, or where 
the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the facility manager.

    When the town finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this division, a 
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or 
requirement, the town may serve upon such user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the 
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and 
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the town. 
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after 
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the town to take action, 
including emergency actions or any enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. of 2-7-11(2)) 


Sec. 74-192. - Same—Consent orders. 
    The town may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar

by the town council regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed 
enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before the town council why the proposed 
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by 
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service 
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(b) ?The town council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its 
members or any officer or employee of the assigned department to: 
(1) ?Issue in the name of the town council notices of hearings requesting the attendance and 
testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such 
hearings; 
(2) ?Take the evidence; 
(3) ?Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence 
together with recommendations to the town council for action thereon. 
(c) ?At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded 
steno-graphically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or 
any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(d) ?After the town council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for 
the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued 
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been 
installed on existing treatment facilities, and devices or other related appurtenances are properly

within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service 
and/or water service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related 
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other 
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management 
practices designed to minimize the amount pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may 
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does 
a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. 
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or be a prerequisite for, taking any other action 
against the user.

such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears 
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. 
The town may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, 
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an 
endangerment to the environment. 
(1) ?Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its 
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the 
suspension order, the town may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate 
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving 
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The town may allow the user to recommence its 
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the town that the period of 
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 74-197 of this division 
are initiated against the user. 
(2) ?A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent 
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful 
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the town, prior to the 
date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 74-193 or 74-197 of this division.

Sec. 74-212. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations—Upset. 
(a) ?For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional 
and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond 
the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by 
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of 
preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b) ?An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met. 
(c) ?A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly 
signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1) ?An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2) ?The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3) ?The user has submitted the following information to the town within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided 
within ten days: 
a. ?A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b. ?The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the

(a) ?A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for 
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 74-91 of this division or the specific 
prohibitions in section 74-92 of this division, if it can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it 
did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges 
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and either: 
(1) ?A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit 
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2) ?No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents 
from the user's prior discharge when the town was regularly in compliance with its VPDES 
permit, and, in case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal 
requirements.

Sec. 74-214. - Same—Bypass. 
(a) ?"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment 
facility. "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the 
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of 
natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe 
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b) ?A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or 
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient 
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
    If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the facility 
manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(c) ?A user shall submit oral notice to the facility manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds 
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A 
written submission shall also be provided within ten days of the time the user becomes aware of the 
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration 
of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the 
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and 
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The facility manager may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d) ?Bypass is prohibited, and the facility manager may take enforcement action against a user for a 
bypass, unless: 
(1) ?Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2) ?There was no feasible alternative to bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, 
retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. 
This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the 
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal 
periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(3) ?The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. The facility 
manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the facility 
manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in the first paragraph of 
subsection (d) of this section.

    Yard, side: An open, unoccupied space on the same lot as a building between the side line of the 
building (exclusive of steps and landing) and the side of the lot, and extending from the front yard line to 
the rear yard line. 


ARTICLE III. - JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY 


Sec. 3.1. - Application. 
    No person shall subdivide any tract of land that is located within the town except in conformity with 
the provisions of this ordinance, the zoning ordinance and the provisions of Virginia law relating to land 
subdivision and development. Prior to subdividing any tract of land, consent shall be required from all 
legal owners of the property to be subdivided and shall be so indicated on the final plat. 


Sec. 3.2. - Platting required. 
    Any owner or developer, of any tract of land situated within the corporate limits of the Town of 
Abingdon, Virginia, who subdivides the same shall cause a plat of such subdivision, with reference to 
known or permanent monuments, to be made and recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court 
of Washington County, Virginia. No such plat of a subdivision shall be submitted for recordation unless 
and until it shall have been approved and certified in accordance with the regulations set forth in this 
ordinance. In addition, no lot shall be sold in any such subdivision before the plat shall have been 
approved in accordance with this ordinance and recorded. Before any permits are issued to begin 
construction, a certified copy of the plat, with the clerk of the court's signature and seal, shall be submitted 
to the building inspector, the director of planning, and the director of public works that adequately verifies 
that the plat has been properly recorded with the clerk of the circuit court in accordance with this 
ordinance. 


Sec. 3.3. - Authority. 
    The planning commission is charged with the responsibility of approving preliminary plats, in 
accordance with the regulations herein contained. The commission shall likewise consider final plats and 
make recommendations, for approval or disapproval, to the town council which retains, unto itself, the 
authority for final approval of final plats. 


Sec. 3.4. - Approval. 
    The town council may require the approval of final plats by the health official, the Washington County 
Service Authority, and/or utility company or companies involved. Such approval, when required, shall be 
indicated upon the plat. 


ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE 
    The subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat, improvement plans, a performance bond, and a final 
plat, in accordance with these regulations. 


DIVISION 1. - PREAPPLICATION 


Sec. 4.1. - Preapplication and concept sketch. 
    The applicant may schedule a conference, with the appropriate town official(s), to review a sketch for 
any proposed subdivision, in order to determine whether the concept generally meets the requirements of 
the zoning and subdivision ordinances, and to identify any concerns or issues raised by the proposed 
subdivision. The town official(s) comments shall be informal and shall not constitute a formal approval or 
disapproval of the subdivision. 


DIVISION 2. - PRELIMINARY PLAT 


Sec. 4.2. - Requirements. 
    The director of public works, town engineer or director of planning shall discuss the preliminary plat, 
with the subdivider, in order to determine whether or not the preliminary plat generally conforms to the 
requirements of the subdivision ordinance and the zoning ordinance. The subdivider shall then be 
advised in writing, which may be by formal letter or by legible markings on a copy of one of the 
preliminary plats submitted, concerning any additional data that may be required, such as contour 
intervals or street grading plans; specific changes that are required in the preliminary layout; the character 
and extent of public improvements that will have to be made; and an estimate of the cost of construction 
or improvements and the amount of the performance bond. In determining the cost of required 
improvements and the amount of the performance bond, the town shall require the developer's engineer 
to prepare the data for review by the town engineer. 


Sec. 4.3. - Copies and fees. 
    Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, the subdivider or his authorized representative shall 
submit four copies of a preliminary plat complying with the requirement of article VII and of this article. 
Said plans shall be accompanied by a fee which may be established by the town council from time to 
time. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the town engineer not less than 15 work days prior to the 
next regular meeting of the commission. The town engineer shall carefully examine said plats as to its 
compliance with the laws and regulations of the town, the existing street system, and good engineering 
practices, and shall submit any findings to the commission together with one copy of the plat received. 


Sec. 4.4. - Approval of other departments. 
    In order to insure that there are adequate provisions for drainage and flood control and other public 
purposes, and for light and air, and for identifying soil characteristics, the commission may require that 
approval be given by other departments, such as the health department, the Washington County Service 
Authority and/or utility company or companies involved. 


Sec. 4.5. - Consideration by planning commission. 
    The commission shall, at the next regular meeting after receiving the town engineer's report, 
consider said report, and act upon the plat. It shall then set forth its recommendation in writing of 
approval, modification or disapproval. In case of modification or disapproval, it shall give its reasons 
therefore. The commission shall forthwith return one copy of the approved, modified or disapproved 
preliminary plat to the subdivider. 


Sec. 4.6. - Approval and terms. 
    Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the commission, the subdivider may proceed with the 
preparation of the final plat and detailed construction drawings and specifications for the improvements 
required under these regulations. 
    The approval of the preliminary plat by the commission is revocable, as set forth herein, does not 
constitute a guarantee of approval of the final plat, and does not constitute a final approval or acceptance 
of the subdivision by the town council or authorization to proceed on construction of improvements within 
the subdivision, but shall constitute approval of layout and general engineering proposals and plans. 
Once a preliminary subdivision plat is approved, it shall be valid for a period of five years, provided the 
subdivider (i) submits a final subdivision plat for all or a portion of the property, within one year of such 
approval and (ii) thereafter diligently pursues approval of the final subdivision plat. "Diligent pursuit of 
approval" means that the subdivider has incurred extensive obligations or substantial expenses relating to 
the submitted final subdivision plat or modifications thereto. However, no sooner than three years 
following such preliminary subdivision plat approval, and upon 90 days written notice, by certified mail to 
the subdivider, the commission may revoke such approval upon a specific finding of facts that the 
subdivider has not diligently pursued approval of the final subdivision plat. 


DIVISION 3. - FINAL PLAT 


Sec. 4.7. - Submittal. 
    The subdivider shall submit to the director of planning and town engineer an original full-scale Mylar, 
or equivalent, and ten 11? × 17? copies of a final subdivision plat no less than 15 work days before the 
commission's next meeting. However, before submitting the final plat, the subdivider shall furnish all plans 
and information, as listed in article VIII, necessary for the detailed engineering consideration of the 
improvements necessary to obtain the approval of the director of planning and the town engineer. 


Sec. 4.8. - Action of the commission. 
    The commission shall, within 60 days from the date of submission of the final plat, recommend to the 
town council to approve, modify, or disapprove such plat, and failure to act within 60 days shall be 
deemed approval, unless the commission shall have notified the subdivider, in writing, of a necessity to 
extend the period of its consideration of the plat. 


Sec. 4.9. - Compliance. 
    The final plat shall not be approved until the subdivider has complied with the general requirements 
and minimum standards of design, in accordance with this ordinance, and has made satisfactory 
arrangements for performance bonds to cover the cost of necessary improvements. The commission shall 
certify its approval, on said plat, by so indicating on the final plat. 


Sec. 4.10. - Revisions. 
    No change, erasure or revision shall be made on any preliminary or final plat, nor on accompanying 
data sheets, after approval has been endorsed, in writing, on the plat or sheets, unless authorization for 
such change has been granted in writing. 


Sec. 4.11. - Action by the commission. 
    When the final plat has been acted upon, by the commission, the final plat and performance bond 
shall forthwith be transmitted to the town council, together with documentation showing the action of the 
commission. 


Sec. 4.12. - Approval of final plat. 
    When the final plat has been approved by the town council, the performance bond accepted, and the 
final plat has been signed and certified, one copy shall be delivered to the town engineer and one original 
Mylar to the subdivider for filing and recording in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Washington 
County. If said plat is disapproved by the town council, such disapproval shall point out in writing wherein 
said proposed plat is objectionable. 


Sec. 4.13. - Resolution of acceptance of plat. 
    The passage of the resolution accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of the 
area shown on the final plat, but the owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the Office of the Clerk 
of the Circuit Court of Washington County, and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording with the 
town engineer before thtown shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect. Approval of the final 
plat shall not be deemed the acceptance by the town of any street, alley or other public space shown on 
the plat for maintenance, repair or operation thereof, and shall be null and void if a copy thereof is not 
recorded as required above, within six months after approval, unless such time of recordation is extended 
by the town council. 


Sec. 4.14. - Relation to private contracts. 
    This ordinance bears no relation to any private easement, covenant, agreement or restriction, nor is 
it the responsibility of any public official to enforce such private easement, covenant, agreement or 
restriction. When this ordinance calls for more restrictive standards than are required by private contract, 
the provisions of this ordinance shall control. 


ARTICLE V. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS 


Sec. 5.1. - Private and public responsibility. 
    There is a mutual responsibility between the subdivider and the town to subdivide land in such a 
manner as to improve the general use pattern of the land being subdivided. 


Sec. 5.2. - Acreage subdivisions. 
    Whenever the area is divided into lots, containing one or more acres, and there are indications that 
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building lots, consideration must be given to the 
highway, street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional local streets can be 
opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots. Easements, providing for the future 
opening and extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the town council, be made a requirement 
of the plat. 


Sec. 5.3. - Flood control regulations. 
    The subdivider shall prepare a contour map of the proposed area, with contour intervals of two feet 
and shall prepare drainage plans or flood control devices satisfactory to the town engineer. No plat shall 
be approved until the town engineer shall certify that the proper plans for drainage and flood control have 
been made. In the event that the manager so certifies, the subdivider's engineer shall prepare the cost 
estimates for the construction of such facilities. 


Sec. 5.4. - Adequate building site. 
    To ensure that owners will have sufficient land upon which to construct a structure that is flood free, 
compliance with floodway widths and the 100-year flood elevations, contained within the town's Flood 
Insurance Study (FIS), is mandatory. The town engineer may require the applicant to provide elevation 
and flood profiles, based on a 100-year flood plain (which means that a flood of a magnitude likely to 
occur, on the average, only once every 100 years), sufficient to demonstrate the land to be completely 
free of the danger of flood water at an elevation of at least one foot below any probable floor level of any 
structure for human occupancy. 


Sec. 5.5. - Street elevations. 
    Except as provided herein the town engineer shall not approve streets subject to inundation or 
flooding by water. All streets must be adequately located above the line of flood elevation to prevent 
isolation of areas by flood. Drainage facilities in local, collector and cul-de-sac streets shall be designed to 
handle a storm with an expected return period of once in every ten years. Drainage facilities in arterial 
streets shall be designed to handle a storm with a 25-year return period. 


Sec. 5.6. - Streets. 
    The following regulations shall govern the layout and naming of streets. 


DIVISION 1. - RELATION TO ADJOINING PROPERTY AND STREET SYSTEMS 


Sec. 5.7. - Adjoining property. 
(a) ?Where it is necessary for the orderly extension of the town's street system to provide for street 
access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary line 
of such property. Half streets along the boundary of land proposed for subdivision are not permitted. 
(b) ?The arrangement of streets, in new subdivisions, shall make provision for the continuation of 
existing streets in adjoining areas where streets already exist. Major, collector and local streets shall 
be respectively extended as such. The street arrangement must be such as to cause no 
unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property. 
(c) ?Should a subdivision abut on only one side of an existing street, the subdivider shall dedicate 
enough land so that one-half of the width of such street, as measured from the centerline to the 
subdivision property line, shall be one-half the standard width of such street as classified. 


DIVISION 2. - LEVEL OF SERVICE 


Sec. 5.8. - Level of service. 
    No development shall be approved if such development, at ultimate build out, will result in or 
increase traffic on the arterial or collector street to which it is connected, so that the street does not 
function at an average daily traffic level of service C or better, or a peak traffic level D, as described in "A 
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets", latest edition, published by the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The applicant may propose and construct 
approved traffic mitigation measures to provide adequate roadway capacity for the proposed 
development. The applicant for any development shall provide a traffic impact analysis which, at a 
minimum, includes the following information: 
(1) ?Peak hour trip ends generated by the development as described in "Trip Generation", latest 
edition, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
(2) ?Information on the street in which the connection is being made: peak hour traffic along with its 
directional distribution, lane and shoulder widths, the type of terrain, and the percentage of 
trucks, buses, and RV's on the connection street. The development engineer shall use this 
information to conduct a traffic capacity analysis as described in "The Highway Capacity 
Manual", latest edition, published by the transportation research board. Additionally, the 
engineer shall determine if a left or right turn lane is necessary utilizing the "Minimum Standards 
of State Entrances" document, latest edition, published by the Virginia Department of 
Transportation. All or part of the traffic analysis may be waived by the director of public works 
depending upon the type and size of development, the condition of the connection street, or an 
interpretation of the minimum information given above. 


DIVISION 3. - APPROACH ANGLE 


Sec. 5.9. - Angle. 
    Local streets shall approach the major or collector streets at an angle of not less than 80 degrees, 
unless the commission, upon recommendation of the town engineer, shall approve a lesser angle of 
approach for reasons of contour, terrain, or matching of existing patterns. 


DIVISION 4. - STREETS IN RELATION TO RAILROADS 


Sec. 5.10. - Railroad right-of-way. 
    When the area to be subdivided adjoins a railroad right-of-way, the intersection of the centerline of 
any street or highway paralleling the railroad, with that of any street that crosses the railroad, shall not be 
less than 150 feet from the line of the railroad right-of-way. 


DIVISION 5. - STREET AND ALLEY WIDTHS, CULS-DE-SAC, EASEMENTS 


Sec. 5.11. - Minimum width. 
    The minimum width of existing and proposed streets, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as 
shown on the street designation map incorporated in Addendum A. The minimum width of streets, which 
do not appear on said map, shall be classified according to potential traffic load determined by the public 
works department as follows: 
(1) ?Arterial or thoroughfare streets, not less than 80 feet, or as shown on the current state 
transportation plan. 
(2) ?Collector streets, not less than 60 feet. 
(3) ?Local service streets which cannot be extended in the future, not less than 50 feet. 
(4) ?Alleys, if permitted, not less than 20 feet. 
    Whenever subdivided property abuts an existing half street the remainder of the street shall be 
dedicated to make the right-of-way on the half-street abutting the subdivision comply with these 
requirements. 
Note— Addendum A is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the town 
offices. 


Sec. 5.12. - Alleys. 
    Alleys shall be provided in business and industrial districts, except that the commission may waive 
this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street 
loading and unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
    While not required, the commission may recommend alleys be provided to serve residential 
properties where such alleys are considered necessary. In any case, dead end alleys should be avoided 
where possible, but, if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities as 
recommended by the commission. 


Sec. 5.13. - Cul-de-sac. 
    Local terminal streets (cul-de-sac), designed to have one end permanently closed, shall not be 
longer than 1,000 feet, to the beginning of the turn-around. Each cul-de-sac must be terminated by a turn-
around having a property line diameter of at least 100 feet. If surface water drains into the turn-around, 
due to the grade of the street, necessary storm drainage facilities and drainage easements shall be 
provided. Minimum face of curb radius shall be 42 feet. 


Sec. 5.14. - Provisions for street access. 
    Where the commission requires provisions for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets 
shall be extended by dedication and construction to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end 
streets shall be provided with a temporary turn-around. 


DIVISION 6. - STREET NAMES AND HOUSE NUMBERS 


Sec. 5.15 - Street names. 
    Unless the commission allows an exception, proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with 
others already existing and named, shall bear the names of the existing streets. In no case shall the 
name of the proposed streets duplicate existing street names regardless of the use of the suffix street, 
avenue, boulevard, drive, way, place or court. Street names shall be indicated on the preliminary and final 
plats and shall be approved by the commission. Names of existing streets shall not be changed except by 
the approval of the town council. House numbers (911 addresses) shall be assigned by the town. 


DIVISION 7. - LAYOUT OF STREETS 


Sec. 5.16. - Intersections and right angles. 
    Whenever possible, streets should intersect at a right angle. Where a deflection angle of more than 
two degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On 
streets 60 feet or more in width the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 300 feet, on other 
streets not less than 100 feet. Face of curb radii at intersections shall generally be not less than 30 feet 
for collector streets nor less than 20 feet for local streets. Face of curb radii at arterial street intersections 
shall be as determined by the town engineer. 


DIVISION 8. - STREET AND ALLEY GRADES 


Sec. 5.17. - Street grades. 
    On streets that are required to have a right-of-way width of 60 feet or more, grades shall not exceed 
six percent. On streets and alleys permitted to have a right-of-way width of less than 60 feet, grades shall 
not exceed twelve percent. 


Sec. 5.18. - Private streets and reserve strips. 
    Unless otherwise provided herein or in the town zoning ordinance, there shall be no private streets 
platted in any subdivision. Every subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street 
constructed to the standards of this code and accepted and maintained by the Town of Abingdon. There 
shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets. 
    Minimum pavement width: 
(1) ?Streets shall be graded to the cross section and profile approved by the commission. Collector 
streets shall be surfaced to a width of 40 feet (face of curb to face of curb) and local service 
streets shall be surfaced to a width of 34 feet (including gutter pans). 
(2) ?The minimum pavement width for alleys shall be 16 feet. 


Sec. 5.19. - Blocks. 
(a) ?Length. Blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length and they shall not be less than 400 feet in 
length. 
(b) ?Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow for two tiers of lots at minimum depth except where 
prevented by topographical conditions or width of property, in which case the commission may alter 
the width. 
(c) ?Crosswalks. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the commission may require one or more public 
crosswalks, of not less than ten feet in width, to extend entirely across the block and at locations 
deemed necessary. 
(d) ?Block orientations. Where a subdivision adjoins a major road, the commission may require that the 
greater dimension of the block shall front or back upon such major thoroughfare to avoid 
unnecessary ingress or egress. 
(e) ?Business or industrial blocks. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be designed 
specifically for such purposes with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and delivery 
facilities. 


Sec. 5.20. - Lots. 
(a) ?Arrangement, design, and shape. The lot arrangement, design, and shape shall be such that lots 
will provide satisfactory and desirable sites for buildings, and be properly related to topography and 
conform to requirements set forth herein. Lots shall not contain peculiarly shaped elongations solely 
to provide necessary square footage of area which would be unusable for normal purposes. 
(b) ?Conformance with zoning ordinance. All lots shown on the subdivision plat must conform to the 
minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance as to area and dimensions, for the zone in which the 
subdivision is located. 
(c) ?Each abut on a public street. Each lot shall abut on a street dedicated by the subdivision plat or an 
existing publicly dedicated and maintained street, or on a street which has become public by right of 
use. Interior lots having frontage on two streets shall be avoided except where unusual conditions 
make other design desirable. 
(d) ?Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient for maintenance of required building lines 
on both streets as required by the zoning ordinance. 
(e) ?Lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles, or radial to the street line. 
(f) ?Lot remnants forbidden. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a tract 
must be added to adjacent lots, rather than be allowed to remain as unmarketable or nonconforming 
parcels. 
(g) ?Subdivision property under single ownership. Where the land covered by a subdivision includes two 
or more parcels in separate ownership and the lot arrangement is such that a property ownership 
line divides one or more lots, the land in each lot so divided shall be transferred by deed to single 
ownership before approval of the final plat, and such transfer certified to the commission by the Clerk 
of the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia. 


Sec. 5.21. - Reservation of land for public purposes, easements, etc. 
    The commission may require subdividers to set aside land for parks, playgrounds, schools, libraries, 
municipal buildings and similar public uses, subject to the following regulations: 
(1) ?Limit as to extent of land dedicated. Subdividers shall not be required to dedicate land for parks 
and playgrounds exceeding five percent of the area of the subdivision, exclusive of street and 
drainage reservations, without reimbursement by the town. Where land is required in excess of 
this amount, the reimbursement by the town shall be based on a proportionate share of (i) cost 
of raw land, (ii) cost of improvements, including interest on investment, (iii) development costs, 
(iv) plus not more than ten percent profit on the total of such costs. 
(2) ?Reimbursement and time limit for certain dedications. Subdividers shall not be required to 
reserve land for public purposes other than streets, storm drainage, sanitary sewers, parks and 
playgrounds, except on a reimbursement basis. They shall be reimbursed by the jurisdiction or 
agency requiring the land. They shall not be required to hold the land longer than 12 months 
following the recording of the plat for such purchase. If the land is not purchased within the said 
12 months, it platted. To facilitate such possible eventual sale of reserved land as separate lots, 
the subdivider shall show on his final plat, by dotted lines and dotted numbers, the sizes and 
dimensions of lots to be created within the boundaries of any such reserved land, and may sell 
such lots, after the expiration date of the reservations, any such reserved land is divisible into 
lots and/or streets in a manner compatible with the remainder of the subdivision, so that the 
subdivider will not be required to reserve an unusable portion of his subdivision. 
(3) ?Meeting with subdivider required for reservation of land. The commission shall not require any 
such reservation of land unless and until responsible representatives of the agencies for whom 
land is to be reserved have met with the commission and the subdivider jointly to discuss the 
reservation. Such representatives may be required by the commission to indicate the needs of 
their agency in writing. Insofar as is reasonably possible, the commission shall require no 
dedication or reservation which calls for reimbursement to the subdivider unless it has been 
assured that the reservation will be required by the agency requiring it within 12 months 
following the recordation of the final plat. 
(4) ?Rezoning required for commercial land set-aside. Nothing herein shall be construed to mean 
that land may be set aside for commercial purposes in a residential zone, without the land so 
required for commercial use being rezoned appropriately in accordance with the zoning 
ordinance by the town council. 
(5) ?Easements required for utilities. Where alleys are not provided in the plat, easements of not 
less than ten feet in width shall be granted to the town by the owner on each side of all rear lot 
lines and where necessary, along side lot lines for public utility requirements. Easements of 
greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots when necessary for the extensions 
of main sewers or other utilities. No buildings or structures will be permitted on easements. 
Easements 20 feet in width shall be required for all public sanitary sewer lines, centered on 
existing or proposed sanitary sewer lines, within the area platted. 
(6) ?Provision for drainage of surface waters required. Wherever any stream or surface watercourse 
is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall at his own expense, make 
adequate provisions for the proper drainage of surface water and shall also provide and 
dedicate to the town an easement along said streams and watercourses meeting the approval 
of the commission. 


Sec. 5.22. - Monuments. 
    Upon completion of subdivision streets, sewers, and other improvements, the subdivider shall make 
certain that all monuments required by the town are clearly visible for inspection and use. Such 
monuments shall be inspected and approved by the director of public works before any improvements are 
accepted by the town council. 
    At least two concrete monuments four inches in diameter or square, two feet long, with a flat top, or 
other standard acceptable to the public works department, shall be set in each subdivision block. The top 
of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with 
the finished grade. A minimum of two monuments in each subdivision shall be tied to the Global 
Positioning System (GPS). 


Sec. 5.23. - Platting of part of a tract. 
    Whenever part of a tract is proposed for platting and it is intended to subdivide additional parts in the 
future, a sketch plan for the entire tract shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. 


Sec. 5.24. - Building lines to conform with zoning regulations. 
    Front setbacks, side yards, and rear yard lines conforming with zoning regulations shall be shown on 
all lots within the platted area. 


Sec. 5.25. - Exceptions in planned large-scale developments. 
    Whenever a subdivision is developed as a planned unit development or other large-scale 
development under appropriate provisions of the zoning ordinance, the commission may vary the 
requirements of sections 5.6 through section 5.20 of this article in order to allow the subdivider more 
freedom in the arrangements of the streets, blocks and lots, but at the same time protecting the 
convenience, health and safety of the probable future residents of the subdivision as well as the general 
welfare of the surrounding area. 


Sec. 5.26. - Group housing development. 
    A comprehensive group housing development, including the large scale construction of housing units 
together with necessary drives and ways of access may be approved by the planning commission 
although the design of the project does not include standard lot and subdivision arrangements, if 
departure from the foregoing standard can be made without destroying the intent of the subdivision 
ordinance. 


ARTICLE VI. - IMPROVEMENTS 


Sec. 6.1. - Generally. 
(a) ?The subdivider shall install and construct, at his cost, all improvements required by this article, in 
subdivision lying wholly or in part in the Town of Abingdon, which includes new streets, portions of 
existing streets, any easement, extension of drainage, sewer or water systems, or right-of-way 
connecting two public streets. All required improvements that are under the control of the Town of 
Abingdon shall be installed and constructed in accordance with the specifications and under the 
supervision of the town engineer. 
(b) ?Any improvements, which are installed and constructed as part of a subdivision or development, 
which are not required but will come under control of the Town of Abingdon, shall be installed and 
constructed, in accordance with good engineering practices, and approved by the town engineer. 


Sec. 6.2. - Inspection of construction. 
    Inspection during and after installation of improvements will be made by representatives of the town 
and approving agencies to insure conformity with approved plans and specifications. The subdivider shall 
notify the town in writing three days before commencing construction or installation on any item of 
improvement and of each phase of street construction. The subdivider shall also notify the town upon 
completion of each improvement item or phase of street construction. The subdivider shall provide 
adequate competent supervision on the project site, during construction of the required improvements 
and shall keep one set of approved plans, profiles and specifications on the project site at all times when

Section 8-3. - Area, setback, frontage, yard and height regulations. 
    The old and historic district shall follow the general established pattern already in existence in the

Section 8-4. - Certificate of appropriateness required to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, restore, 
move or demolish a building. 
    8-4-1. In order to promote the general welfare through the preservation and protection of historic 
places and areas of historic interest, the following review procedures shall be followed: 
a. ?Certificates of appropriateness. Except as provided below in sections 8-4-lb and 8-13-3, no 
building or structure within the old and historic district may be demolished or moved in whole or 
in part, nor may any architectural features of said building or structure which are subject to 
public view from any public street, right-of-way or place be altered in any way that affects the 
external appearance of the building or structure, including such items as roofs, chimneys, 
fences and color changes, without (i) prior approval of an application to the board of 
architectural review ("board") hereinafter created, and (ii) the board's issuance of a certificate of 
appropriateness. Neither shall any building or structure hereafter be erected, constructed, 
reconstructed, altered, restored, moved or demolished within the old and historic district without 
the same prior approval and issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. 
b. ?Routine maintenance and minor action exclusion. Upon written application, the zoning 
administrator of the Town of Abingdon (the "administrator") may determine that certain minor 
actions involving buildings and structures within the old and historic district will have no 
permanent effect on the character of the district, and, by written waivers issued to the parties 
wishing to take the minor actions, exempt them from review by the board. Such minor actions 
shall be limited to those listed in the design review guidelines described in section 8-9-1 below 
under the topic heading "routine maintenance and repair of buildings and other minor actions". 
Each application for waiver must be on the form provided by the office of the administrator and 
documented by appropriate samples of the materials and colors to be used in taking the minor 
actions. With respect to each waiver issued hereunder, the administrator shall see to it through 
the town's inspection department that the work performed and materials employed comply with 
the terms of the particular waiver. Provided, however: 
(i) ?If the administrator is uncertain about his authority to grant a waiver or if the administrator 
and the applicant cannot agree on changes in any application for waiver, the application

question, which decision shall be final; 
(ii) ?If the administrator denies an application for a waiver, the applicant may appeal the 
administrator's decision to the board, in which case the board's decision shall be final; and 
(iii) ?If a waiver is issued and the work is commenced but in the opinion of the administrator the 
work does not qualify for a waiver the administrator shall order that the work be stopped 
until the applicant secures a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to section 8-5 below. In 
any such case the applicant may appeal to the board, whose decision on the question shall 
be final. 
The administrator shall provide the board with a copy of each application for a waiver at the 
board's regularly scheduled meeting next following the date the application was received. 
c. ?Work undertaken without authorization. In addition to the sanctions provided in article 24, 
section 24-2 of this ordinance and any other remedy available at law or in equity, the 
administrator shall issue a stop work order if any work subject to this section 8-4 is started 
without authorization by either the board or the administrator, as provided above in 
Sections 8-4-la and 8-4-lb, respectively. Any such stop work order shall (i) remain in effect 
until the party proposing to do the work secures appropriate authorization; and, (ii) be

structure, list proposed materials, textures and colors and include samples of such materials and colors. 
Additionally, the board may request that the applicant provide photographs of the existing structures and

Section 8-6. - Board of architectural review—Creation and membership. 
    8-6-1. Creation and empowerment of the board. For the purpose of making effective the provisions of 
this article, a board of architectural review ("board") is hereby established and empowered to consider 
and review all alterations, additions and changes within the boundaries of the old and historic district 
which fall within the purview of section 8-4-1 of this article, whether or not brought before it by an 
application for a certificate of appropriateness or other permit. 
    8-6-2. Duty to enforce and sanctions. The board shall make its decision on each project brought 
before it and see to the enforcement of its decisions through the administrator and the town's inspection 
department, to the end that buildings, structures or other resources of historic, architectural, or cultural 
significance are preserved insofar as they are appropriate and incongruous projects are prohibited. The 
failure of an applicant or any other person to observe the board's decisions shall be subject to the 
sanctions provided in article 24, section 24-2 of this ordinance. 
    8-6-3. Composition of the board. The board shall consist of five members appointed by the town 
council, one of whom shall be a resident of the old and historic district and all of whom shall have a 
demonstrated interest, competence, or knowledge in historic preservation. All members must be residents

member is required to attend at least one informational or educational meeting per year which has been 
approved by the state department of historic resources as pertaining to the work and functions of the 
board or historic preservation. Provided, when adequate review of any proposed action would normally 
involve a professional discipline not represented on the board, the board must seek and secure 
appropriate professional advice before rendering its decision on the particular action. The administrator 
shall serve as advisor to the board. 
    8-6-5. Terms of office and vacancies. The board members shall be appointed for three-year terms

furnish the applicant with its written decision stating the reasons for disapproval and make 
recommendations with respect to the appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material, color,

if within the 90-day period following the date of disapproval the applicant submits an amended application 
that complies with all recommendations of the board. Provided, the board shall not otherwise re-hear the 
subject matter of any application which has been denied for a period of one year after the date of the 
hearing, or if a re-hearing was held, for a period of one year after the rehearing.

    8-9-3. Matters the board shall and shall not consider. The board shall not consider interior 
arrangement of the building or structure or features not subject to view from a public street, right of way or 
place. In addition to those specified in the design review guidelines, the board shall consider the following 
matters in passing on the appropriateness of a particular project:

c. ?Texture, material and color of the building materials employed. 
d. ?The relationship of the factors in a., b. and c. above to similar features of buildings and 
structures and uses in the immediate surroundings. 
e. ?The extent to which the building or structure or the use would be harmonious with or obviously 
incongruous to the old and historic aspect of the surroundings. 
f. ?In case of a building or structure to be demolished, a primary consideration will be the extent to 
which its continued existence would tend to protect irreplaceable historic places and preserve 
the general historic atmosphere of the town. 
g. ?The extent to which the building or structure or the use will promote the general welfare of the 
town and all citizens by the preservation and protection of historic places and areas. 
h. ?The extent to which said preservation and protection will promote the general welfare by 
maintaining and increasing real estate values; generating business; creating new positions; 
attracting tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and artisans and new residents; 
encouraging study and interest in American history; stimulating interest and study in 
architecture and design; educating citizens in American culture and heritage; and, making the 
town a more attractive and desirable place in which to live. 
i. ?The extent to which either existing or proposed landscaping, including but not limited to trees, 
shrubbery or other vegetation associated with the building, structure or use, are harmonious 
with or incongruous to the old and historic aspects of the particular site. 
(Ord. of 6-2-03; Ord. No. 1-2006, 1-3-06) 


Section 8-10. - Same—Issuance of certificate of appropriateness. 
    8-10-1. Procedure following approval of certificate. Immediately upon approval by the board of any 
application to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, restore, move or demolish a building or structure, a 
certificate of appropriateness signed by the chairman of the board and valid for one year from the date of 
issuance shall be issued to the applicant and made available to the town inspection department. 
a. ?After issuing any building permit pertinent to the particular work the town inspection department 
shall see to it that the work performed and materials employed comply with the terms of the 
certificate of appropriateness and notify the administrator upon completion of the authorized 
work. Provided, (i) no building permit may be issued in the case of any work covered by article 
8-4-1 a until a pertinent certificate of appropriateness is issued; but (ii) the certificate of 
appropriateness will in no way affect the requirement to comply with other provisions necessary 
to obtain a building permit. 
b. ?Unless work is commenced within the one-year period and thereafter continuously prosecuted 
with no delay or suspension of more than 90 days (subject to extension for good cause 
demonstrated to the administrator and excluding any time the use of the certificate of 
appropriateness is stayed pursuant to appeal or court action) a certificate of appropriateness 
shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect. 
    8-10-2. Notification requirement. In the case of any application for a certificate of appropriateness for 
moving or demolition, new construction, extensive exterior renovations or building additions, adjacent 
property owners shall be notified in writing and public notice given of the date and time of the meeting of 
the board to consider such action and afforded an opportunity to be heard at such meeting. No certificate 
of appropriateness may be issued until such notice is given and opportunity provided. 
(Ord. of 6-2-03) 


Section 8-11. - Maintenance of historic properties. 
    8-11-1. Protective maintenance required. Pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2280, as amended, all 
unoccupied buildings and structures subject to this article shall be preserved against decay and 
deterioration, maintained free from structural defects and repaired to the extent necessary to prevent 
irreparable damage. For purposes of this article, a building or structure is unoccupied if in the preceding 
12 calendar months no person has inhabited the premises on a continuous basis as a residence, place of 
work or place of carrying on official duties. 
    8-11-2. Standard of maintenance and repair required. The maintenance and repair required by this 
section 8-11 must be sufficient to (i) protect the structural components of the building or structure and its 
exterior from damage by reason of either collapse or deterioration to such an extent that repair and 
preservation are not economically feasible; and (ii) maintain the character of the district in which the 
building or structure is located. Specific items of maintenance and repair include but are not limited to 
correction of any of the following defects: 
a. ?Deterioration of exterior walls, chimneys, foundations or other vertical support. 
b. ?Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs or other horizontal members. 
c. ?Leaning, sagging, splitting, listing or buckling caused by deterioration under items a. and b. 
d. ?Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plasters or mortars. 
e. ?Defective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and foundations including windows and doors. 
f. ?Inadequate weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint. 
g. ?Insect infestation, rotting, holes and other forms of decay. 
h. ?Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames. 
i. ?Deterioration of architectural details, including cornices, entablatures and wall facings. 
j. ?Delamination, instability, crumbling or loss of shape from deterioration under items h. and i. 
k. ?Deterioration of fences, gates and accessory structures. 
    8-11-3. Enforcement. When it is brought to the attention of the board that a property may have 
deteriorated to the point that it cannot meet the standards specified in section 8-11-2 above, the board 
shall first request a meeting with the property's owner or authorized representative (including without 
limitation executor, administrator or trustee) and endeavor to discuss with such person ways to improve 
the condition of the building or structure in accordance with a mutually agreeable time schedule. If such 
procedure leads to correction of the violation to the board's satisfaction, no further action will be taken. 
a. ?If the informal procedure does not lead to correction of the condition, the board shall request 
that the administrator cause the condition of the building or structure to be investigated further 
through the town's inspection department acting as an agent for the board, and, within 14 days 
thereafter, make a determination whether it is in violation of this section 8-11. If such 
investigation leads to a determination there is no violation, no further action will be taken. 
b. ?If the investigation leads to a determination that there is a violation or probable violation, the 
administrator shall give the owner or authorized representative as described above written 
notice in which the repairs and work necessary to comply with the provisions of this section 8-11 
are specifically described and ordered to be performed. The repairs and work shall be 
completed within 90 days from receipt of notice or such longer period of time the administrator 
may specify consistent with the extent of the repairs and work, subject to extension for good 
cause demonstrated to the administrator. 
c. ?Failure to complete the necessary repairs and work within the period allowed for completion 
under the preceding section 8-11-3b shall constitute a violation of this article punishable as 
specified in article 24, section 24-2 of this ordinance. In addition, the board may, after due 
notice to the owner or authorized representative as described above, direct the administrator to 
enter the property and make or cause to be made such repairs as are necessary to preserve 
the integrity and safety of the building or structure and charge the reasonable cost thereof to the 
owner, which charge shall, so long as it remains unpaid, constitute a lien against the real 
property upon which the building or structure is situated. 
d. ?In addition to any other available ground for relief, any owner aggrieved by an order issued 
under the preceding section 8-11-3b may file a written petition with the board for relief on the 
ground that the performance of the repairs and work would cause undue economic hardship. To 
perfect such remedy the petition must (i) be filed with the board within ten days after receipt of 
such notice and order; and, (ii) include evidence bearing on the claim for relief and 
circumstances of hardship including at a minimum the following items: 
1. ?Nature of ownership, whether business or individual. 
2. ?Financial resources of the owner claiming economic hardship. 
3. ?Cost of repairs and work provided in the notice and order. 
4. ?Assessed value of the pertinent land and improvements. 
5. ?Real estates taxes and annual debt service for the previous two years. 
6. ?Any listing of the property for sale or rent and offers received, if any. 
7. ?Annual gross income and cash flow received from leasing or other use of the property for 
the previous two years. 
8. ?Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years. 
If the remedy is so perfected, the notice and order shall be stayed, and within 30 days after any 
such petition is filed the board shall schedule a public hearing on the claim of undue economic 
hardship. Following a full hearing on the merits, the board shall, within 30 days thereafter, make 
a finding whether or not the notice and order would entail undue economic hardship and enter 
the reasons for such finding into the record. 
If the finding is that undue economic hardship would result, it shall be accompanied by a 
recommended plan to relieve the hardship which has included in its consideration (i) any 
available property tax relief; (ii) loans or grants from the town, county or other public, private or 
non-profit sources; (iii) acquisition of the property by purchase or eminent domain; (iv) 
modification of the building code or changes in applicable zoning regulations; (v) relaxation of 
this article sufficient to mitigate the economic hardship; and (vi) any other available means of 
relief known to the board. The board shall report its finding to the administrator, who shall issue 
an order for the property to be repaired within the time specified in section 8-11-3a in the case 
of a finding of no undue economic hardship and an order for the property to be repaired or 
otherwise handled according to the recommended plan in the case of a finding of economic 
hardship. 
e. ?Any person aggrieved by the action of either the board or the administrator under this section 8-
11 shall, by following the filing procedure specified in section 8-12-1 below, have a right of 
appeal to the town council and from the town council to the circuit court. 
(Ord. of 6-2-03) 
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 2, 2003, renumbered the existing § 8-11 as 8-12, 
amended said section, and added a new § 8-11 as set out herein. The historical notation has been 
retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes. 


Section 8-12. - Right of appeal. 
    8-12-1. Right to appeal on disapproval of application. Whenever the board shall disapprove an 
application for a certificate of appropriateness any person shall have the right to appeal and be heard 
before the town council, which may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the board, in whole or in part. 
Provided, any person wishing to appeal must file with the town manager on or before 14 days after the 
decision of the board a written notice of intention to appeal which states the reasons for appeal in full and 
factual form. Upon receipt of such notice the town manager shall schedule a public hearing before the 
town council at a time not less than 30 days after the receipt of the notice. Such hearing shall be 
advertised at the expense of the appellant and notice given once a week for two successive weeks in 
some newspaper published or having general circulation in the town, specifying the time and place of 
hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views, not less than five days nor more 
than 21 days after the second advertisement appears in such newspaper. 
    8-12-2. Right to appeal on approval of application. Opponents to the granting of an application for 
certificate of appropriateness shall likewise have the right to appeal and be heard by the town council, 
which may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the board, in whole or in part. Provided, within five 
working days after the decision of the board the persons wishing to appeal must file with the town 
manager a petition signed by not less than ten individuals registered to vote in the town, indicating their 
intention to appeal. Upon receipt of such petition the town manager shall schedule a public hearing before 
the town council within the time period and with the same provision for notice specified in section 8-12-1. 
Any person to whom a certificate of appropriateness has been issued may commence work within the 
five-day period provided for notice of appeal, but at that person's sole risk. 
    8-12-3. Right of appeal to circuit court. Any person whose appeal has been denied by the town 
council shall have the right to further appeal the decision of the town council within 30 days of the 
rendering of such decision by filing a petition at law with the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia, 
setting forth the alleged illegality of the action of the town council. The filing of said petition shall stay the 
decision of the town council pending the outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the filing of such 
petition shall not stay the decision of the town council if such decision denies the right to demolish an 
historic landmark, building or structure. The court may reverse or modify the decision of the town council, 
in whole or in part, if it finds upon review that the decision is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of 
discretion, or it may affirm the decision of the town council in whole or part. 
(Ord. of 2-5-90; Ord. of 6-2-03) 
Note— See the editor's note to § 8-11. 


Section 8-13. - Demolition and moving of historic landmarks, buildings or structures. 
    8-13-1. Requirement for board approval. In accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2306, as 
amended, no historic landmark, building or structure within the old and historic district shall be razed, 
demolished or moved until the razing, demolition or moving thereof is either (i) approved by the board, or 
(ii) approved on appeal by the town council after consultation with the board; provided, the owner shall 
have the rights specified in section 8-13-3 in addition to the right to appeal. 
    8-13-2. Permissible action by the board. Pursuant to section 8-4-1, the owner of a landmark, building 
or structure within the old and historic district who wishes to demolish or move the same must first apply 
to the board for a certificate of appropriateness permitting demolition or moving, as to which the board 
may approve, modify or deny the application. In reaching its decision on that or any other application to 
demolish or move, the board may require the applicant to provide post-demolition or moving plans for the 
affected site and consider whether such plans would be appropriate to the historic and architectural 
character of the adjoining properties and the district as a whole. The board shall also consider the criteria 
listed in the design review guidelines described in section 8-9-1 of this ordinance, the criteria listed in 
section 8-9-3 and any other available information pertinent to its deliberations. 
    8-13-3. Procedure to demolish or move by following sale procedure. If the board disapproves any 
application to demolish or move as provided in section 8-13-2, the owner may appeal the board's decision 
as specified above in section 8-12. However, in addition to such right of appeal, the owner of an historic 
landmark, building or structure, the razing or demolition of which is subject to the provisions of section 8-4 
of this article 8, shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to raze or demolish such landmark, building or 
structure, provided (i) the owner has applied to the town council for such right; and (ii) the owner has, for 
the period of time set forth below, made and continuously maintained in effect at a price reasonably 
related to its fair market value, a bona fide offer to sell the landmark, building or structure and the land 
pertaining thereto to the town or to any person, firm, corporation, government or agency thereof, or 
political subdivision or agency thereof, which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to preserve and 
restore the landmark, building or structure and the land pertaining thereto; and (iii) no bona fide contract, 
binding upon all parties thereto, shall have been executed for the sale of such landmark, building or 
structure and the land pertaining thereto prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in 
item c., below. Provided: 
a. ?Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8-12-3 that stay decisions of the town council pending 
appeal, no appeal to the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia, by the owner or any other 
proper party shall affect the owner's right to make a bona fide offer under section 8-13-3. 
b. ?Any offer to sell must be made within one year after the date the town council renders its final 
decision as provided in section 8-13-4 below, but thereafter the owner may renew his request to 
such governing body to approve the razing or demolition of the historic landmark, building or 
structure. 
c. ?The time schedule for offers to sell shall be as set forth in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2306, as such 
provision may from time to time be amended. 
    8-13-4. Action required by the town council on application to sell under section 8-13-3. Before 
making a bona fide effort to sell as provided in section 8-13-3, the owner shall first file an application with 
the town council that contains a statement identifying the property and stating (i) the source and amount 
of the proposed offering price; (ii) the date the offer of sale is proposed to begin; (iii) the name and 
address of any real estate agents or brokers listing or to list the property; (iv) the exact terms and 
provisions of the deed to be used in the sale, including a legally sufficient description of the land to be 
offered and the covenants relating to renovation and restoration of the building or structure situated on 
the property; and (v) the proposed advertising measures and measures to assure preservation and 
renovation by a buyer. Provided: 
a. ?The proposed offering price shall be established by an appraisal prepared at the owner's 
expense by a licensed real estate appraiser. If the town council is uncertain that such price 
accurately reflects fair market value of the property, the town may, at its sole expense, hire 
another licensed real estate appraiser within five working days after receipt of the owner's 
statement. Within the 30-day period commencing on the date the town hires the second 
appraiser, (i) the appraiser selected by the owner and the appraiser selected by the town shall 
select a third licensed real estate appraiser, whose services shall be paid in equal shares by the 
owner and the town; and (ii) a majority of two of the three appraisers shall establish a price to 
be recommended to the owner. 
b. ?If in the town council's judgment the advertising measures proposed by the owner are 
inadequate to assure that the offering will reach the maximum possible number of qualified 
buyers and provide them with a reasonable opportunity to examine the property, the town 
council shall provide the owner with a written response that specifically describes the 
deficiencies and suggests means whereby they may be corrected. Similarly, if in its judgment 
the proposed deed fails to comply with the requirements of section 8-13-3, the town council may 
provide the owner with a written response which specifically describes the deficiencies and 
suggests means whereby they can be corrected. 
    Upon receipt of the owner's application the town council shall place the matter on the agenda for its 
next regularly scheduled meeting, at which it will conduct a full and impartial hearing and permit testimony 
from not only the owner-applicant but interested members of the public. The town council may, in its 
discretion, continue the matter from time to time pending a showing to the satisfaction of the town council 
that the application complies with the requirements of section 8-13-3 for a bona fide offer to sell, at which 
time the application shall be approved. Upon such approval the time period specified in section 8-13-3c 
as applicable to the particular offering price shall commence.

section 8-13-3, the owner shall cause the property concerned to be advertised for sale in accordance with 
the plans, specifications and procedures specified in the application (as it may have been revised by 
reason of suggestions under section 8-13-4b above) and thereafter continue the advertising in the same 
manner and to the same extent, with no interruption, until the sooner occurring of the signing of a bona 
fide contract binding on all parties thereto or expiration of the appropriate time period. If a bona fide 
contract binding on all parties is signed and closed in accordance with the original application as 
approved by the town council, no further action under this section 8-13 will be required.

of all advertisements, (ii) schedules showing when, where and how the advertisements were 
employed; (iii) any listings with real estate agents or brokers and offers received; and (iv) any 
fliers or other descriptions of the property prepared pursuant to such listings. 
b. ?Upon receipt of the owner's application the board shall place the matter on the agenda for its 
next regularly scheduled meeting and thereafter approve the application if in its judgment the 
requirements of section 8-13-3 for a bona fide offer and sale have been met. Otherwise, the 
board shall follow the procedure for a rehearing set out in section 8-8-4 of this ordinance 
pending such approval. In any event, the owner shall, by following the filing procedure specified 
in section 8-12-1, have a right of appeal to the town council and from the town council to the 
circuit court.

landmarks may be established or recognized to the full extent of the powers granted the town in Code of 
Virginia, § 15.2-2306, as amended.

structures, sites and areas having a special historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or 
value. 
8-14-2. ?Recommendation of historic districts and landmarks. The board may recommend to the 
town council the initiation of an amendment to this article to designate landmarks and historic 
districts from the list established under section 8-14-1 above, giving the reasons for its 
recommendation. Any such amendment shall be in accordance with the provisions of Code of

8-14-3. ?Criteria for selection. A building, structure, group of structures, area, site or district may be

qualify for selection under section 8-14-3, giving the basis or reason for its qualification and a 
legally sufficient description of the property concerned. The board shall, at its next regular 
meeting, schedule a hearing on the application at a time which gives at least 30 days written 
notice to any owner who has not joined in or ratified the application. Similarly, either the town 
council or the planning commission may, on its own volition, initiate designations under this 
section 8-14. 
8-14-6. ?Moratorium on alteration or demolition while designation pending. So long as any 
proceedings have been filed and are pending under section 8-14, the board shall not approve 
any subsequently filed application for a certificate of appropriateness or other permit to erect, 
construct, reconstruct, alter, restore, move or demolish any building, structure or other feature 
on a site or area included in or encompassed by the proceedings. Provided, if final action on the 
proceedings has not been completed within the 90-day period following initiation of the 
proceedings, the certificate of appropriateness or other permit may be approved.

ARTICLE 8A. - DOWNTOWN ABINGDON ARTS AND CULTURAL DISTRICT[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Cross reference— Licenses, § 18-26 et seq.; taxation, § 66-1 et seq. 


Sec. 8A-1. - Purpose. 
    The Town of Abingdon finds that the continued development and success of its downtown 
commercial district requires incentives, and determines that the most appropriate method of offering 
incentives for the area described is to create an Arts and Cultural District in that area, as authorized by 
the Code of Virginia, § 15.2-1129.1. The town believes that the establishment of an Arts and Cultural 
District will improve the economic conditions of this geographic area located in the central portion of the 
town which could, in turn, benefit the welfare of the citizens of Abingdon. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-2. - Administration. 
    The Administrator of the Town of Abingdon Arts and Cultural District shall be the town manager or 
designee. The administrator, in consultation with the town manager and the treasurer, shall determine 
and publish the procedures for obtaining the benefits created by this chapter and for the administration of 
this chapter. 
    The administrator shall be the single point-of-contact for qualified business owners and organizations 
to take advantage of the Arts and Cultural District incentives described in this article, and shall provide 
recommendations as necessary to streamline the processes for a business or organization to qualify and 
obtain the incentive. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-3. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings, 
unless clearly indicated to the contrary: 
    Qualified arts business or organization: The term shall mean a business or not-for-profit organization 
physically located within the Town of Abingdon Arts and Cultural District which, by the determination of 
the administrator, positively contributes to the spectrum of arts and cultural activities and venues available 
to the public. Examples may include, but are not limited to, theatres, art galleries, museums, music clubs, 
dance studios, etc. 
    Qualified cultural business or organization: The term shall mean a business or not-for-profit 
organization physically located within the Town of Abingdon Arts and Cultural District, which by the 
determination of the administrator, positively provides goods or services or activity for visitors. Examples 
may include, but are not limited to hotels; restaurants, music clubs, retail and/or businesses that advance 
the town's strategic goals identified in the most recently adopted town comprehensive plan. 
    In no case shall a primary office use such as a bank, real estate office, attorney's office, etc. qualify 
as an arts business or organization or cultural business or organization. 
    This creation of an Arts and Cultural District does not effect any other existing requirements for 
businesses, such as zoning regulations, including the Historic Overlay District. 
    Existing companies within the boundaries of the town which qualify under any of the criteria set forth 
above shall be qualified. A company meeting the criteria which moves into the town shall also qualify. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-4. - Boundaries. 
    The Arts and Cultural District shall be the area defined in the Town of Abingdon Zoning Ordinance 
and on the official zoning map, attached hereto. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-5. - Eligibility requirements. 
    Economic incentives and regulatory flexibility may be made available to any new or expanded 
business listed by the town as an arts or cultural related business or organization. The business or 
organization must advance the town's strategic goals identified in the town's comprehensive plan. The 
business or organization must commit to a performance agreement based upon a three year business 
plan, sales revenues, or other significant criteria. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-6. - Taxes eligible for exemption. 
    Qualified businesses or organizations shall be eligible for exemption or rebate from the following 
local taxes: 
The business, professional and occupational license taxes and fees imposed by Chapter 18, Article 
II, of the Code of the Town of Abingdon. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-7. - Amount of exemption. 
    Qualified businesses and organizations shall be exempt for a period up to five consecutive years 
from the town's business, professional and occupational license taxes and fees identified in section 18-
28(c), above. Year one is the calendar year in which the business or organization becomes a qualified 
arts or cultural related business if it is qualified prior to June 30 of the first year. Otherwise, year one shall 
be the year following the year in which the business becomes qualified. If a business or organization 
ceases to be a qualified business or organization during a year in which rebates or exemptions apply, 
they shall be prorated for the months the business was a qualified business. In the case of multi-year 
incentives, the business shall establish its qualification for the incentives on an annual basis. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-8. - Procedure for tax exemption. 
    The procedures shall be determined by the administrator and approved by the town manager. No 
incentive application shall be approved until the treasurer makes a determination that no other unpaid 
taxes are outstanding. Once an incentive application has been approved and the business certified by the 
administrator as a qualified business, a performance agreement shall be written and the business shall be 
entitled to the exception created by this article. 
(Ord. of 10-5-09(2)) 


Sec. 8A-9. - Compliance. 
    Failure of the business to pay in full by the due date any taxes imposed by the town shall result in the 
loss of the exemption for the remainder of the current year upon a finding by the administrator that such 
delinquency is significant. The Town of Abingdon reserves the right to withdraw qualified business status 
for any business that is not compliant with any town ordinance, regulation, or other legal requirement. 
    Failure of the business to meet the minimum criteria established in sections 8A-5 and 8A-6 regarding 
eligibility shall result in the loss of the exemption for the remainder of the current year and may result in a 
requirement to reimburse the Town of Abingdon the full amount of revenue that would have been 
generated through the full tax rate as specified in the performance agreement. 
    Non-profit organizations already receiving monetary support or contributions from the town will not 
be eligible to receive additional funding sources.

ARTICLE 14. - PTD PLANNED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. 


Section 14-1. - General statement of purpose. 
    The planned technology development (PTD) district is established primarily for high technology 
manufacturing and industrial uses. Supporting accessory uses and facilities, including offices, commercial 
establishments, and residential areas are also permitted. The PTD district is intended to be designed with 
a park-like setting that complements surrounding land uses by means of appropriate siting of buildings, 
controlled access points, attractive and harmonious architecture, effective landscape buffering and 
common open space with scenic view easements. The district is intended to provide flexibility in design 
and site layout, allow latitude in combining different types of uses within a single development, and 
provide the developer with incentives to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional and environmentally 
friendly planned development. 
    In addition, the intent of the planned technology development (PTD) district is to provide certain 
industries that are clean and environmentally efficient the opportunity to locate in an area of similar 
technologies in what is generally known as a mixed use park, developed under a complete, 
comprehensive master plan. Standards are provided for landscaping, buffering and open space to 
encourage high technology industries and to ensure a park-like atmosphere. Important in determining the 
location and size of a PTD are the accessibility of the location, the availability of public utilities, public 
safety services and the suitability of the topography for site and building development purposes.

    Each planned technological development shall be subject to the following site development 
standards: 
1. ?Minimum district size: Five acres of contiguous land. 
2. ?Minimum required setbacks: 
(a) ?All structures proposed to front on existing public streets external to the PTD shall be 
located a minimum of 30 feet from the existing public right-of-way. 
(b) ?Minimum setbacks from internal PTD streets shall be ten feet for public streets and 30 feet 
from any private streets. 
(c) ?Side yards for any main structure which adjoins a residential or open space zone or use 
shall be a minimum of ten feet. 
(d) ?Rear yards for any main structure which adjoins a residential or open space zone or use 
shall be a minimum of 25 feet. 
3. ?The zoning administrator shall require buffer screening areas based on section 18-5-3 of this 
ordinance and the existing or proposed use in the PTD. In no case shall a buffer screening area 
adjoining any residential district or use be less than ten feet in width. 
4. ?Lot coverage: Maximum lot coverage for main and accessory structures shall be determined 
through the preliminary master plan process and shall not exceed 75 percent. 
5. ?Public streets in the PTD district shall be built in accordance with Town of Abingdon minimum 
standards. In reviewing the PTD preliminary master plan, the planning commission may 
recommend and the town council may approve, one or mere private streets within the proposed 
district. Private street standards, specifications and a proposed maintenance agreement shall 
be submitted with the preliminary master plan. 
6. ?The applicant may propose a reduction in the number of parking spaces required by section 17-
6 of this ordinance for each use type, if justified. This proposal will be reviewed with 
consideration given to potential future uses of the site, parking demand and expansion potential. 
7. ?Maximum height of structures: When any adjoining property is residential in zoning or use, a 
height limit of 45 feet will be observed, including rooftop mechanical equipment. The maximum 
height may be increased provided each required yard (side, rear, or buffer) adjoining a 
residential district or use is increased by two feet above the minimum for each foot in height 
over 45 feet. This distance shall be measured from the portion of the structure that exceeds 45 
feet. In all other locations the height is unlimited. 
8. ?Arrangement of areas: 
(a) ?The location and arrangement of structures, parking, access drives, outdoor lighting, signs 
and other uses and developments within the PTD, in addition to achieving these 
development standards, shall be accomplished in accordance with an approved final 
master plan to assure compatibility with the existing and future land use in the vicinity. 
(b) ?All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate improvement or 
development shall be specified as reserve areas in the preliminary master plan. The future 
use and the limitations on future use of such reserve areas shall be specified. Reserve 
areas included in the PTD shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a neat and 
orderly manner. 
9. ?Accessory structures shall not exceed forty percent of the gross floor area of the principal 
structure. 
10. ?Every structure in the PTD shall be a fully enclosed building of permanent construction. Any 
outside storage area shall be fully screened so that no materials so stored are visible at any lot 
line or public right-of-way. 
11. ?Outdoor lighting: Lighting shall comply with section 18-5-4 of this ordinance. 
12. ?Utilities: Utilities shall be underground unless the type of service necessary for normal activities

through this principal entrance into the PTD, should have a landscaped median of sufficient 
width and planting density to meet the purposes of this district. 
(B) ?Parking within the PTD should be located to the side or rear of the principal structures on the 
lot, wherever feasible. During review, consideration will be given to topographical constraints, 
innovative site design, buffering and landscaping factors. 
(C) ?Loading areas should be screened from public view and should not be placed in front yards. 
(D) ?Fences should not be placed in front yards except as necessary for security purposes. Fencing 
should be uniform and well kept. 
(Ord. of 9-10-01)

    All zoning and subdivision ordinances and regulations shall apply to any proposed development 
within the PTD district, unless modified by the planning commission and town council in the approval of 
the final master plan. 
(Ord. of 9-10-01) 


Section 14-7. - Application process. 
(A) ?The process for approval shall be the same as the process outlined for amendments in Article 25 of 
this ordinance. The Town of Abingdon will make every reasonable effort to complete the application 
process within this established time frame. Any application to rezone land to the PTD designation 
shall constitute an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance pursuant to Article 25. 
(B) ?Prior to submitting a formal application for review and approval under these provisions, the 
applicant and town staff shall meet to discuss the requirements of this section. The purpose of the 
meeting is to obtain a mutual understanding of the application requirements and process. The 
applicant is encouraged to submit information on the scope and nature of the proposal to allow staff

frame. The commission's report shall recommend approval, approval with modifications, or 
disapproval of the preliminary master plan. Failure of the commission to make a report of its findings 
to the town council within this period shall constitute a commission recommendation of approval. 
(F) ?If the planning commission recommends denial of the preliminary master plan, or approval with 
modification, the applicant shall, if requested, have 60 days to make any modifications. If the 
applicant desires to make any modifications to the preliminary master plan, the town council's review 
and action shall be delayed until such changes are made and submitted for review.

ARTICLE 15. - FH FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted August 2, 2010, effective Sept. 2, 2010, amended App. B, Art. 15, 
in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. 15, §§ 15-1—15-12, pertained to similar subject 
matter, and derived from an ordinance adopted June 7, 1993, as amended. 


Section 15-1. - Purpose. 
    This article is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2280. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish and identify those areas which should be subject to special 
regulations on account of a greater probability of flooding thereon. The purposes of establishing such 
areas are to protect life and property; to reduce public costs for flood control, rescue and relief efforts; to 
protect recognizable ecological values; to prevent: the creation of health and safety hazards, disruption of 
commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for 
flood protection and relief, the impairment of the tax base and to support and conform to the National 
Flood Insurance Program, by: 
    15-1-1 Regulating uses, activities, and developments which, acting alone or in combination with 
other existing or future uses, activities and developments, will cause unacceptable increases in flood 
heights, velocities and frequencies. 
    15-1-2 Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and developments from locating within areas 
subject to flooding. 
    15-1-3 Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur in flood prone areas to be 
protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage. 
    15-1-4 Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are unsuited for intended 
purposes because of flood hazards. 
(Ord. of 8-2-10(1)) 


Section 15-2. - Applicability. 
    These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the Town of Abingdon and identified 
as being flood-prone as stipulated in this article. 
(Ord. of 8-2-10(1)) 


Section 15-3. - Compliance and liability. 
    15-3-1 No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, 
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and 
provisions of this article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within 
the jurisdiction of this article. 
    15-3-2 The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is considered 
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study, but does 
not imply total flood protection. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be 
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. 
This article does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such 
district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
    15-3-3 Records of actions associated with administering this article shall be kept on file and 
maintained by the administrator or his/her designee. 
    15-3-4 This article shall not create liability on the part of the the Town of Abingdon or any officer or 
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative

Section 15-8. - Establishment of flood hazard districts. 
    15-8-1 Basis of districts. The various flood hazard districts shall include special flood hazard areas. 
The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the FIS and the FIRM for Washington County, 
Virginia and incorporated areas prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal 
Insurance Administration, dated September 29, 2010, and any subsequent revisions or amendments 
thereto. The boundaries of the special flood hazard area and flood hazard districts are established as 
shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this article and which shall be kept on file at the 
Abingdon Planning Department offices. 
a. ?The Floodway District is delineated for purposes of this article using the criteria that a certain 
area within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the water of the base flood without 
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. These 
areas included in this district are specifically defined in Table 3 of the above-referenced FIS and 
shown on the accompanying FIRM (FIRM) on file with the Abingdon Planning Department. 
b. ?The Floodway Fringe District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the maps 
accompanying the FIS for which the base flood elevations have been provided. 
c. ?The Approximated Floodplain District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the maps 
accompanying the Flood Insurance Study. In these zones, no detailed flood profiles or 
elevations are provided, but the base flood floodplain boundary has been approximated. For 
these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other 
acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific base flood elevation 
cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers Flood Plain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-prone Quadrangles, 
etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this 
elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and 
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of 
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect 
currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted 
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Town of Abingdon. 
d. ?Other flood districts shall be those areas identified as Zone X on the maps accompanying the 
flood insurance study. This zone includes areas of 0.2 percent annual chance flood; areas of 
one percent annual chance flood with average depths of less than one foot or with drainage 
areas less than one square mile. 
    15-8-2 Overlay concept: 
a. ?The flood hazard districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying zoning 
districts as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for the 
floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. 
b. ?If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the flood hazard districts and 
those of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the 
flood hazard districts shall apply. 
c. ?In the event any provisions concerning a flood hazard district is declared inapplicable as a result 
of any legislative or administrative action or judicial discretion, the underlying district provisions 
shall remain applicable. 
    15-8-3 Official flood hazard districts map. The boundaries of the flood hazard districts are 
established as shown on the flood insurance rate map which is declared to be a part of this article and 
which shall be kept on file by the Town of Abingdon Planning Department. 
    15-8-4 District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the flood hazard districts may be revised 
by the Town of Abingdon where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed 
studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified 
agency, or an individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, 
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration. 
    15-8-5 Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the flood hazard 
district shall be made by the administrator. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the 
districts, the board of zoning appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or 
contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case 
to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
    15-8-6 Submitting technical data. The Town of Abingdon's base flood elevations may increase or 
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not 
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the administrator shall notify the 
Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a 
submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding 
conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
(Ord. of 8-2-10(1)) 


Section 15-9. - Utilization of the flood hazard district. 
    All uses, activities and development occurring within any flood hazard district shall be undertaken 
only upon the issuance of a special use permit. Such development shall be undertaken only in strict 
compliance with the provisions of this article and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, as 
amended, such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VA USBC) and the Town of Abingdon 
Subdivision Regulations (VA USBC is available online, public libraries and at the office of the building 
official at the Abingdon Town Hall). Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the administrator shall 
require all applications to include compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and shall review all 
sites to assure they are reasonably safe from flooding. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity 
and/or development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways or any watercourse, 
drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system. 
    15-9-1 The placement of any manufactured home (mobile home) within any Flood Hazard District is 
specifically prohibited, except as a replacement for a manufactured home on an individual lot or parcel or 
in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed 
provided all the requirements specified in section 15-12-5(d) are met. 
    15-9-2 Any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the administrator or designee in 
the administration or enforcement of this article or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto shall follow

d. ?Topographic information showing existing and proposed ground elevations. 
    15-9-4 The following uses shall be permissible in the floodway district provided that they are in 
compliance with the provisions of the underlying district and provided that the development will not 
increase base flood elevations: 
a. ?Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, 
horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming and wild crop harvesting. 
b. ?Public and private recreational uses and activities such as parks, day camps, picnic grounds, 
golf courses, swimming areas, hiking and horseback trails, wildlife and nature preserves, game 
farms, fish hatcheries and fishing areas. 
c. ?Open accessory residential uses such as yard areas, gardens, play areas and previous loading 
areas, but not storage or other structures. 
d. ?Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other 
developments are prohibited unless certification such as hydrologic and hydraulic analyses 
(with supporting technical data) is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in 
any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood. Hydrologic and hydraulic 
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated 
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in 
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the administrator. Development activities which 
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the 
developer or applicant first applies — with the Town of Abingdon's endorsement — for a 
conditional flood insurance rate map and floodway revision, and receives the approval of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
e. ?If section 15-9-5(d) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply 
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 15-12. 
    15-9-5 The following uses may be permitted in the floodway fringe district provided that they are in 
compliance with the provision of the underlying district: 
a. ?Structures, except for mobile homes, accessory to the uses and activities in section 15-9-4, 
above. 
b. ?Utilities and public facilities and improvements such as railroads, streets, bridges, transmission 
lines, pipe lines, water and sewage treatment plants and other similar, related uses. 
c. ?Temporary uses such as circuses, carnivals and similar activities. 
d. ?Other similar uses and activities provided that they cause no increase in flood heights and/or 
velocities. All uses, activities and structural developments shall be undertaken in strict 
compliance with the floodproofing provisions contained in this and all other applicable codes 
and ordinances. 
e. ?Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or 
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, 
designated as Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the 
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will 
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within 
the Town of Abingdon. Development activities in Zone AE, on the Washington County, Virginia 
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map which increase the water surface elevation 
of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or 
applicant first applies — with the Town of Abingdon's endorsement — for a conditional FIRM 
revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    15-9-6 Approximated floodplain districts. In flood fringe or approximated flood plain district, the 
development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of underlying district 
provided that all such uses, activities and/or developments shall be undertaken in strict compliance with 
the elevation, flood-proofing and related provisions contained in the VA USBC and all other applicable 
portions of the Town Code and ordinances. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the 
applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts, such as 
point on boundary, high water marks, or hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analyses, 
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the administrator. 
    The administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analyses for any 
development. When base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated a minimum of 
one foot or above the base flood elevation. During the permitting process, the administrator shall obtain:

structures; and, 
b. ?If the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the 
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. 
    15-9-7 In other flood districts, the development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance 
with the regulations of underlying district provided that all such uses, activities and/or developments shall 
be undertaken in strict compliance with the elevation, floodproofing and related provisions contained in 
the VA USBC and all other applicable portions of the Town Code. 
a. ?All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the 
lowest floor, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest 
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood 
depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated no less than one foot above the 
highest adjacent grade. 
b. ?All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall 
1. ?Have the lowest floor elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above 
the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the 
FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, shall be elevated at least one

2. ?Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely flood-proofed to the 
specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially 
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability 
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c. ?Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters 
around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. of 8-2-10(1)) 


Section 15-10. - Procedures for considering variances in the flood hazard districts. 
    15-10-1 Variances shall be authorized only upon notice and hearing as required by the Code of 
Virginia, § 15.1-431, as amended, and in accordance with the sections set forth in Article 22 of the Zoning 
Ordinance for the Town of Abingdon, Virginia. Variances shall be issued only upon a finding by the board 
of zoning appeals that: 
a. ?The strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship to the applicant; and 
b. ?After the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not 
result in: 
1. ?Unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood height; or 
2. ?Additional threats to public safety, or otherwise strictly against public policy; or 
3. ?Extraordinary public expense; or 
4. ?The authorization of said variance shall not: 
(a) ?Create nuisances; or 
(b) ?Cause fraud or victimization of the public; or 
(c) ?Conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
    15-10-2 All actions by any agent, commission or board of the town including but not limited to 
variances, shall consider all pertinent facts found in other sections of the Zoning Ordinance and 
especially: 
a. ?The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by 
encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity 
within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the base flood elevation. 
b. ?The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream or the injury of others. 
c. ?The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent 
disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions. 
d. ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such 
damage on the individual owners. 
e. ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
f. ?The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
g. ?The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
h. ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in 
the foreseeable future. 
i. ?The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for the town and surrounding area. 
j. ?The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
k. ?The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters 
expected at the site. 
l. ?The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may 
be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum 
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
m. ?Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this article. 
    15-10-3 When considering variances, the board of zoning appeals shall ensure that the granting of 
same will comply with the requirements of the VA USBC. In addition, no variance within the floodway will 
be granted if it will cause an increase in the base flood elevation. 
    15-10-4 The board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation 
pertaining to any request for a variance to a registered design professional or other qualified person or 
agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and 
velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
    15-10-5 Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has made its determination 
in accordance with 15-10-1(a—b) above, and as set forth in the provisions for appeal article of the Zoning 
Ordinance for the Town of Abingdon, Virginia. 
    15-10-6 Variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the 
variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
    15-10-7 The board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing and signed 
by the administrator with regard to applicant's petition. If the requested variance is authorized and the 
applicant is, thereby, allowed to construct a structure below the base flood elevation, said board of zoning 
appeals shall include in such written communication official notification that such construction below the 
base flood elevation: 
a. ?Increases the risks to life and property; and 
b. ?Will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
    15-10-8 Should the decision of the board of zoning appeals uphold the prior decision of the 
administrator, the above mentioned written communication notice shall include instructions as to appeal 
procedure from the board's decision, as found in Article 22, sections 22-5—22-7 of the Zoning Ordinance 
for the Town of Abingdon, Virginia. 
    15-10-9 A record shall be maintained of the above referenced notification as well as all variance 
actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be 
noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings 
must either be certified by a registered design professional or meet the following minimum 
design criteria: 
(a) ?Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject 
to flooding. 
(b) ?The total net area of all openings must be at least one square inch for each square 
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
(c) ?If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings to 
allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
(d) ?The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one foot above the 
adjacent grade. 
(e) ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or 
devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(f) ?Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for 
regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood 
underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires 
openings as outlined above. 
d. ?Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes replaced, or substantially improved, on 
individual lots or parcels or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a 
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must meet all the 
requirements for new construction, including: 
1. ?The elevation and anchoring requirements of the VA USBC; and 
2. ?Shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.

    17-1-3. Each application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by two copies of a scale drawing. 
The drawing shall show the size and shape of the parcel of land on which the proposed building is to be 
constructed, the nature of the proposed use of the building or land and the location of such building or 
use with respect to the property lines of said parcel of land and to the right-of-way of any street or 
highway adjoining said parcel of land. Any other information which the administrator may deem necessary 
for consideration of the application may be required. If the proposed building or use is in conformity with 
the provisions of this ordinance, a permit shall be issued to the applicant by the administrator. One copy 
of the drawing shall be returned to the applicant with the permit. 


Section 17-2. - Certificate of occupancy; surety. 
    17-2-1. No person shall use or permit the use of any building or premises, or part thereof, hereafter 
created, erected, changed, converted, altered or enlarged, wholly or partly, in its use or structure until a 
certificate of occupancy has been issued by the administrator. A change of use of any building shall also 
require a certificate of occupancy. The conduct of a home occupation, the office of a resident member of 
a recognized profession and the office of a resident, all of which may be allowed in the various residential 
districts shall all require certificates of occupancy and shall be subject to all licensing requirements as set 
forth in the Town Code. 
    17-2-2. Such certificates shall show that such building or premises, or part thereof, and the proposed 
use thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
    17-2-3. Where structures are completed and ready for occupancy prior to the completion of all 
improvements required by the site plan, the owner may provide bond with surety adequate to guarantee 
the completion of site plan by a time certain of such site plan improvements as related to the building for 
which the permit is sought, and upon providing of such bond with surety a permit may be issued for the 
occupancy of those structures already completed. The town manager is authorized to accept, instead of 
corporate surety, letter of credit, joint savings account or other like surety. In any case in which any other 
escrow agent (such as an attorney for a mortgage lender) is holding funds to ensure compliance with the 
terms or other regulations or agreements and such funds are in an amount sufficient to ensure 
compliance with the terms of other regulations and agreements, the town manager shall become a party 
to such other escrow agreement as escrow agent for the town; provided that such other escrow 
agreement contains provisions satisfactory to the town manager to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of such site plan and this ordinance. 
    17-2-4. Such certificates shall show that such building or premises, or part thereof, and the proposed 
use thereof are in conformity with this ordinance.

the amount of space required under the off-street parking provisions of section 17-6. If the 
parking lot is to be screened from a residential district or use in accordance with subsection a., 
and such screening is in the form of a planted buffer at least six feet high and five feet deep, 
such screening may count as a part of the five percent of the parking lot area to be landscaped. 
g. ?Parking lots shall meet all the standards and regulations set forth in section 17-6. 
h. ?Parking areas shall be constructed with a slope of five percent or less. The planning 
commission or the director of planning may, however, permit slopes up to ten percent where 
necessary for reasons of topography. 
i. ?All paved parking lots shall be planted with no less than one tree for every five parking spaces or 
fraction thereof. Such trees shall be of a variety which provide shade or are capable of providing 
shade at maturity [see section 18-8 "Canopy trees"] and shall be reasonably dispersed 
throughout the parking lot. 
    18-6-5. Parking garage. The following standard shall be followed in developing site plans for motor 
vehicle parking garages which contain more than ten contiguous spaces: 
a. ?Entrances and exits shall be as far as practicable from street intersections and shall be located 
so as to result in the least possible interference with traffic movement on abutting streets. 
b. ?Not less than one exit lane shall be provided for each 200 parking spaces, or major fraction 
thereof. 
c. ?Driveway widths at the street line shall be not less than 18 feet for driveways accommodating 
one lane of traffic and 24 feet for driveways accommodating two lanes of traffic. In no case shall 
any driveway width at the street line be greater than 35 feet. 
d. ?All portions of the structure used for parking of vehicles shall be illuminated during the hours of 
use by natural or artificial lighting with an intensity of not less than four footcandles measured at 
floor level. 
e. ?The parking garage shall be constructed in such a manner as to screen from outside street level 
view any vehicles parked therein provided, however, that entrances and exits shall be exempt 
from this requirement. 
    18-6-6. Service stations. The following standards shall be followed in developing site plans for 
service stations:

b. ?The minimum distance between driveway and adjoining property line shall be ten feet. 
c. ?The minimum distance between gasoline pump island and back of sidewalk (right-of-way line) 
shall be 16 feet. 
d. ?A raised curb six inches high shall be constructed back of the sidewalk separating the driveways 
and opposite pump island. The raised curb shall extend to within two feet of each driveway. 
e. ?In cases where there is no existing curb, gutter or sidewalk along the street or streets from 
which the service station shall take access, the developer constructing the service station shall 
at his own expense construct the necessary curb, gutter and sidewalk according to the 
specifications of the town. 
f. ?Maximum number of driveways permitted for each 100 feet is two. An additional driveway may 
be permitted for each 50 feet of frontage owned provided that the need can be established and 
the minimum requirements as set out above can be complied with. 
g. ?Service station sites shall contain a minimum of 2,500 square feet for each pump. 
h. ?Buildings shall be set back at least 40 feet from the street right-of-way line and at least ten feet 
from any other property line. 
i. ?The site shall be screened in accordance with the regulations set forth in section 18-5-3. 
j. ?No delivery tanker shall be allowed to park on public right-of-way during gasoline delivery, nor 
shall any hose be permitted on the public right-of-way. 
k. ?At least 50 percent of the street frontage shall be landscaped with plant materials. Such planting 
area shall have a minimum depth of five feet. 
l. ?In order to preserve the sight distance advantage offered by service stations located on street 
corners, that area defined by a straight line drawn between curb cuts shall be landscaped with 
low-profile plants having a height of not more than three feet. Signs or light standards may be 
permitted within this area, but the bottom of any sign or light fixture shall be above the sight line 
of a large truck (approximately eight to ten feet). No portable signs or automobiles shall be 
placed between this area and the station building. 
m. ?All trash shall be stored within a building or within a fenced enclosure in the rear (or, in the case 
of corner sites, rear quarter of the site). 
n. ?In cases where a hillside must be graded for construction, suitable protection for the hillside 
must be provided for slopes in excess of ten percent. Such protection shall be in the form of 
terracing, retaining walls, planting of suitable vegetation or a combination of the above to avoid 
excess runoff and soil erosion. 
o. ?All lighting of the service station shall be provided in accordance with the regulations as set forth 
in section 18-5-4. 
p. ?An attendant shall be responsible for overseeing the pumping of gasoline or related fuels. 
    18-6-7. Animal shelters and animal hospitals. The following standards shall be followed in developing 
site plans for animal shelters and animal hospitals: 
a. ?The building shall be reasonably soundproofed from neighboring residential and commercial 
uses. 
b. ?The site shall be screened or buffered to avoid sound and visual nuisance. 
c. ?Drainage from the building interior and exterior runs and pens shall go to a sanitary sewer 
system. Exterior runs shall be laid out in such a way to prevent storm drainage from surrounding 
areas from combining with the drainage from the runs and pens. 


Section 18-7. - Procedures. 
    18-7-1. Authority for review and approval. Site plans may be approved administratively by the 
director of planning and/or the town manager after first circulating the plan to the director of public works 
for written comments. 
    18-7-2. Preapplication conference: 
a. ?All applicants for site plan review shall first submit a preliminary plan and request a 
preapplication review conference with the director of planning and the director of public works. 
b. ?The purpose of the conference is to discuss the site plan, off-street parking, signs, erosion and 
sedimentation control and other Town Code provisions or other town ordinance requirements, 
utilities, drainage and to consider preliminary features of the proposed development as they 
relate to this article. 
    18-7-3. Submittal of final site plans; review and approval: 
a. ?Administrative review and action. Six copies of the final site plan shall be submitted to the 
director of planning. The director of planning shall circulate the plan to the relevant town 
departments for written comments and notify the applicant of the action taken with respect to 
the site plan, which may include approval, approval subject to conditions or disapproval. All final 
site plans requiring a special use permit shall be submitted to the planning commission for 
review and approval and submitted to the board of architectural review if the project is located in 
the old and historic district. 
b. ?Planning commission approval and action: 
1. ?For those plans which are to go before the planning commission, four additional copies 
shall be submitted to the director of planning prior to the next regularly or specially 
scheduled planning commission meeting. The director of planning shall prepare 
recommendations for the planning commission which shall be based upon the purpose, 
intent and regulations set forth in this article. The recommendations shall be sent to the 
applicant prior to the planning commission meeting. 
2. ?The planning commission may approve, approve subject to specific conditions or 
disapprove the site plan. The site plan shall be considered approved unless the planning 
commission acts within 60 days from the date of submission of the final site plan. 
3. ?The director of planning shall notify the applicant in writing of the action taken by the 
planning commission. In case of conditional approval, the applicant shall make the 
necessary changes and submit six copies of the final site plan for the signature of the 
director of planning. 
    18-7-4. Site plan termination; extensions. An approved site plan shall expire and be null and void 
unless a building permit for the construction of the same substantial elements of the site plan has been 
issued within a period of one year. The director of planning or the planning commission may grant an 
extension of one year. 
    18-7-5. Site plan completion in certain cases. Wherever a property has been wrongfully occupied or 
used without approval of a required site plan and a site plan is thereafter sought and approved to correct 
such violation, such applicant shall furnish a site plan completion bond or other financial guaranty as 
provided in section 17-2 in an amount sufficient to ensure completion of all required features of the site 
plan. If such improvements are not completed by the applicant within such reasonable time as the 
planning commission or director of planning may impose at the time the site plan is approved, the 
administrator may seek recourse for such guaranty to complete the improvements. 
    18-7-6. Amendments to approved site plan. If it becomes necessary for an approved site plan to be 
changed, the director of planning shall at the applicant's request either administratively approve an 
amendment to the site plan, or, if the proposed change will, in the director's opinion, substantially affect 
the terms of the original approval, he may require a new site plan be drawn and submitted for review and 
action in accordance with the provisions of this article and chapter. 
    18-7-7. Issuance of building permits, sign permits and certificates of occupancy: 
a. ?Building permits and sign permits may be issued by the building official in accordance with the 
final approved site plan, signed by the director of planning. 
b. ?The building official shall be responsible for enforcing the requirements as set forth in the final 
approved site plan, before issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and shall give written notice to 
the director of planning that the site plan has been completed before issuing the certificate of 
occupancy. 
    18-7-8. Retention of site plans; conformity. Copies of the approved site plan shall be retained in the 
records of the director of planning and the administrator. All building and occupancy permits shall conform 
to the provisions of the approved site plan. 
    18-7-9. Utilities. Approval of a site plan does not imply availability of public utilities or create any 
obligation on the part of the town to provide same. 
    18-7-10. Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the decision of the planning commission as provided in 
this ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken in writing within 30 days of such decision and referred to the 
town council for study. Such decision of the town council shall be final and binding upon all parties.

special use permit in the EC district. 
(b) ?When otherwise permitted in the underlying district, any newly constructed building intended to 
be occupied with greater than 50,000 square feet of floor area devoted to retail use shall require 
a special use permit in the EC district. (Amd. of 7-7-03) 
    18-9-5. Area and bulk regulations. Uses, buildings and structures shall be subject to regulations for 
lot area, lot width, street frontage, setback, height, yards, parking and signs applicable in the underlying 
districts in which they are located. 
    18-9-6. Certificate of appropriateness required. A certificate of appropriateness is required for the 
following: 
(a) ?No building permit shall be issued involving construction or exterior modifications to a building 
until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued in accordance with section 18-9-7 for 
improvements subject to such building permit. 
(b) ?No site plan shall be approved until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued in 
accordance with section 18-9-7 for all buildings and improvements shown thereon.

planning commission's recommendation to the council on the special use permit. The town council may 
attach such conditions or modify the certificate of appropriateness as it deems necessary in conjunction 
with its action on the special use permit. 
    18-9-8. Design standards. All applications for certificates of appropriateness must satisfy the design 
standards contained in this section.

ARTICLE 20. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT 


Section 20-1. - Applicability. 
    20-1-1. Regulations. The planned unit development is a concept which encourages and permits 
variation in residential developments by allowing deviation in lot size, bulk or type of dwelling, density, lot 
coverage and open space from that required in any one residential district. 
    20-1-2. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish procedures and standards for planned unit 
developments within the corporate limits of the town, in order that one or more of the following objectives 
may be attained: 
a. ?Flexibility in design to take the greatest advantage of natural land, trees, historic and other 
features. 
b. ?Accumulation of large areas of usable open space for recreation, preservation of natural 
amenities and provision of community facilities. 
c. ?Creation of a variety of residential and compatible neighborhood arrangements that give the 
home occupant greater choice in selecting types of environment and living units. 
d. ?Clustering of one residential type for better use of land and open space, as long as the resultant 
density does not exceed the allowed density in the existing district. 
e. ?Allowance of sufficient freedom for the developer to take a creative approach to the use of land 
and related physical development, as well as utilizing innovative techniques to enhance the 
visual character of the town. 
f. ?Efficient use of land which may result in reduction in development and maintenance costs of 
street and utility systems. 
g. ?Establishment of criteria for the inclusion of compatible associated uses to complement the 
residential areas within the planned unit development. 
h. ?Simplification of the procedure for obtaining approval of proposed developments through 
simultaneous review by the town of proposed land use, site construction, lot and setback 
consideration, public needs and requirements, and health and safety. 


Section 20-2. - Use regulations. 
    20-2-1. Primary residential uses. Single-family, two-family, and multiple-family dwelling units in 
detached, semidetached, attached, and multi-storied structures shall be permitted uses. No planned unit 
development shall be allowed which does not incorporate a variety of dwelling types, except that one 
residential type planned unit development may be allowed if it does not exceed the density allowed in the 
district in which it lay immediately preceding its approval to planned unit development application. 
    20-2-2. Secondary nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses of a religious, public, semipublic, 
cultural, recreational or commercial character shall be permitted uses. Such nonresidential uses shall be 
compatible with and secondary to the primary residential use. No building devoted primarily to a 
commercial use shall be built or established prior to the primary residential buildings or uses it is designed 
or intended to serve. The total area of commercial development in the planned unit development shall not 
exceed five percent of the gross area of the planned unit development. Commercial uses shall include 
only uses permitted in the B-1 business district. 


Section 20-3. - Density, area and minimum standards. 
    20-3-1. Gross density. The gross density within a planned unit development shall be computed by 
dividing the total number of proposed dwelling units within the development by the gross development 
area. The maximum gross density shall not exceed 14 units per acre, unless higher density is allowed in 
the existing district. Where one type of residential unit is involved, the density shall not exceed the 
allowed density in the existing district. 
    20-3-2. Minimum area. A planned unit development shall contain a minimum of five contiguous acres 
of land. 
    20-3-3. Minimum development standards. Minimum lot size, maximum lot coverage, street width, 
setbacks, height and distance between buildings shall in general meet health, safety and welfare 
requirements and shall be in harmony with good planning practices. 


Section 20-4. - Open space, community facilities, utilities and access. 
    20-4-1. Common open space and community facilities. The total usable open space within a planned 
unit development shall be at least 20 percent of the gross acreage of the planned unit development. No 
more than 25 percent of the required percentage of usable open space shall be in the form of water 
surfaces or wetlands. Recreation areas and facilities, such as playgrounds, tennis courts, basketball 
courts, swimming pools and community buildings should be provided which will meet the anticipated 
needs of the clientele the planned unit development is designed to serve. Provision of separate adult and 
juvenile recreation areas is encouraged. The following shall not be counted as usable open space: 
a. ?Land that slopes greater than 15 percent. 
b. ?Streets, parking areas and other asphaltic or paved areas, except for pedestrian and bicycle

an administrative officer in the administration or enforcement of this ordinance. 
22-2-2. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as 
will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of 
the provisions will result in unnecessary hardship provided that the spirit of the ordinance shall be 
observed and substantial justice done, as follows: 
    When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where 
by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of 
property at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional 
topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or 
of the condition, situation, or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict 
application of the terms of the ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the 
utilization of the property or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the 
granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship approaching 
confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, 
provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of the 
ordinance. 
    No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds: 
(a) ?That the strict application of the ordinance would produce undue hardship. 
(b) ?That such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and 
the same vicinity. 
(c) ?That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property 
and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. 
    No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing as required by Code 
of Virginia, § 15.1-431, as amended. 
    No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the 
property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature 
as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an 
amendment to the ordinance. 
    In authorizing a variance, the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, 
character and other features of the proposed structure for use as it may deem necessary in the 
public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to ensure that the conditions imposed are 
being and will continue to be complied with.

ARTICLE 23. - AIRPORT SAFETY OVERLAY ZONE 


Section 23-1. - Statement of intent. 
    The Virginia Highlands Airport Safety Overlay Zone is adopted pursuant to Code of Virginia, ch. 11, § 
15.1-491.02, as amended. The zone consists of the airspace over and around the Virginia Highlands 
Airport. The zone is designed to identify and regulate obstructions within that airspace. In order to 
accomplish the necessary controls for this area, the boundaries of this overlay district shall be concurrent 
with those of those specific geometric standards as referred to in the definition of the term "regulations" in 
this ordinance. The intent of the Virginia Highlands Airport Safety Overlay Zone is to prevent any 
obstruction that has the potential for endangering the lives and property of the users of the Virginia 
Highlands Airport and the residents of the Town of Abingdon, Virginia, reduce the size of areas available 
for landing, take off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport 
and the public investment therein. It is declared that in the interest of the public health, safety, and 
general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are hazards to air navigation be 
prevented, that the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential for being a public 
nuisance and may injure the area served by the Virginia Highlands Airport, that the Town of Abingdon, 
Virginia area derives economic development and enhanced interstate commerce from Virginia Highlands 
Airport, when such airport and its surrounding vicinity is held strictly to the highest possible safety 
standards; and that the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the fullest extent 
legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation.

provided for in this article. All nonconforming uses shall obtain a zoning permit and a certificate of 
occupancy within 60 days from the effective date of this ordinance. Such permits shall be issued 
promptly upon the written request of the owner or operator of a nonconforming use. 
C. ?Whenever the administrator determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned or 
more than 50 percent destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that 
would enable such structure or vegetation to be rebuilt, reconstructed, restored, or otherwise 
refurbished so as to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning 
regulations contained in this article, except with the relief as provided for in this article. 
D. ?Any person desiring to erect or increase the height or size of any structure or vegetation not in 
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article may apply for a variance from these 
regulations in accordance with article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance [this appendix] of the Town of 
Abingdon, Virginia. The application for a variance shall be accompanied by an appropriate 
application form provided by the Virginia Highlands Airport Commission, which form may be obtained 
from the administrator. The application to the Virginia Highlands Airport Commission shall be 
deemed approved if no response is received by the administrator from the Virginia Highlands Airport 
Commission within 21 days after the completed form is received by the Virginia Highlands Airport 
Commission. Any such application for a variance shall be accompanied by: 
1. ?Evidence of the submission of the necessary notice of proposed construction or alteration to the 
Federal Aviation Administration together with its action. 
2. ?A determination from the Virginia Department of Aviation as to the effect of the proposal on the 
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. 
Such variances shall only be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the 
regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, 
will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the 
spirit of this article. Once the foregoing are met, an application may then be acted upon as allowed under 
article 22 of this ordinance. 
E. ?Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of 
this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the 
structure or vegetation in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such 
markings and lights as may be deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration, the 
Virginia Department of Aviation, and/or the administrator. If deemed proper through the failure of the 
owner of the structure or vegetation or with other reasonable cause by the board of zoning appeals 
of the Town of Abingdon, Virginia, this condition may be modified to require the owner of the 
structure in question to permit Virginia Highlands Airport Commission to install, operate, and 
maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
F. ?Applications for permits and variances shall be made on forms available from the administrator, with 
such forms allowing for enough specific detail such that proper analysis can be given the request.
